<div>
<p>And it’s fair to say that they received mixed reviews. Some welcomed being better informed about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35255384" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">health risks</span></a> – including increased cancer risk – associated with drinking alcohol. Others have expressed the opinion that guidelines put the UK on the path towards becoming a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/12088101/Health-chiefs-attacked-over-nanny-state-alcohol-guide.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">‘nanny state’</span></a>.</p>
<p>As an organisation dedicated to beating cancer, we were in the former camp. Guidelines like these don’t tell people what to do. Instead, they offer information on how people can reduce their risk of cancer by informing them about the risks of drinking. When they were launched, we blogged about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489795/summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">updated guidelines</span></a>, the weekly guideline of 14 units for both men and women, and how this could be useful in helping people <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/01/08/new-alcohol-guidelines-to-help-cut-cancer-risk/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cut their cancer risk</span></a>.</p>
<p>But how easy is it for people to do this? And do we, as a nation, truly understand the links between alcohol and different types of cancer?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-risks-from-alcohol-new-guidelines"><span style="color: #0066cc;">public consultation</span></a> on how the Government should communicate these guidelines closes today. And our <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/our-research-partnerships/bupa-foundation-cancer-prevention-initiative/the-policy-research-centre-for-cancer-prevention-prcp"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention</span></a>, an in-house research team at Cancer Research UK, working with Dr Penny Buykx’s team at the <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/ph/research/alpol" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">University of Sheffield’s Alcohol Research Group</span></a>, have attempted to find out more about people’s awareness of the risks of alcohol.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/an_investigation_of_public_knowledge_of_the_link_between_alcohol_and_cancer_buykx_et_al.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">latest study</span></a> – carried out before the new guidelines were in place – reveals some worrying gaps in public awareness of alcohol’s harms and people’s knowledge of guidelines.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2016-04-01-9-in-10-dont-link-alcohol-and-cancer"><span style="color: #0066cc;">headline figure</span></a> shows that almost nine in 10 people don’t link alcohol to an increased risk of cancer. And if we dig a bit deeper, an even more worrying gap emerges.</p>
<h3><strong>Alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve written a lot about the link between alcohol and cancer – from discussing the <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2010/01/28/alcohol-and-cancer-the-evidence/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">evidence that it causes cancer</span></a>, to talking about how <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/12/03/less-alcohol-means-a-lower-risk-of-cancer-and-hangovers/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">drinking less reduces your risk</span></a> of developing the disease.</p>
<p>When it comes to the science of how and why alcohol causes cancer, the picture isn’t too clear. But there are a few leading theories, which <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/02/09/how-does-alcohol-cause-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">we blogged about recently</span></a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the underlying mechanism, we know that 12,800 cases of cancer are <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/how-alcohol-causes-cancer"><span style="color: #0066cc;">linked to alcohol each year in the UK</span></a>.</p>
<p>To find out how much the public knows about the link, we worked with Dr Buykx’s team to survey 2,100 people in England, asking questions about their knowledge and use of alcohol guidelines – as well as their awareness of which health conditions are linked to alcohol.</p>
<h3><strong>Public misconceptions of alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>When our study participants were asked to name health conditions linked to drinking too much alcohol, only 13 per cent mentioned cancer. They were then shown a list of health conditions and asked to name those that could be caused by drinking too much alcohol. Almost half (47 per cent) selected cancer. But this is still a low level of awareness compared to 95 per cent who selected liver disease, and 59 per cent who selected diabetes. A large proportion (84 per cent) also recognised that alcohol can cause obesity and excess body weight.</p>
<p>But people were even more unsure when asked which types of cancer are linked to alcohol, and at what level drinking alcohol increases the risk of these cancers.</p>
<p>In the study, people were asked which of seven different types of cancer they thought were linked to alcohol. Of these seven cancers, four are linked to drinking (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bowel-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bowel</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/breast-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">breast</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/mouth-cancer/?ds_kids=p7227183641&amp;adc=cpc&amp;gclid=CNWq2ZPP6soCFSP3wgodtTwF_A&amp;dclid=COSbjJTP6soCFU_QGAodBssFXA"><span style="color: #0066cc;">mouth and throat</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/liver-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">liver</span></a>) and three are not (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/brain-tumour/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">brain</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bladder-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bladder</span></a> and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ovarian</span></a>). The graphic below shows that awareness of the risk – or lack of risk – varied a fair bit. For example, only 18 per cent of people questioned correctly answered that breast cancer was linked to alcohol.</p>
</div>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_33000" style="width: 620px;"><a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/04/01/worrying-gaps-in-peoples-awareness-of-alcohol-and-cancer/"><img alt="160331-alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo" class="wp-image-33000 size-full" height="880" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/11/160331-Alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo.png" width="610" /></a><div class="attachment-image--caption">Infographic created by Cancer Research UK</div></figure>
<div class="pw-hidden-cp">
<p>Each year in the UK, alcohol causes 3,200 cases of breast cancer, the second largest amount after bowel cancer, with 4,800 cases down to alcohol each year. Yet only around four in 10 people (40 per cent) linked alcohol with bowel cancer, and just under half with mouth and throat cancers.</p>
<p>Conversely, over half believed that bladder cancer was linked to alcohol, when research hasn’t actually found a link.</p>
<p>Next, the participants were asked at <em>what level </em>of drinking they thought a person’s risk of developing cancer starts to increase for each type. While eight in 10 people (80 per cent) had correctly said that liver cancer was linked to drinking alcohol, the majority thought this was linked to lower levels of drinking than appears to be the case.</p>
<p>In the UK, around 400 cases of liver cancer are linked to alcohol each year (for context, there are nearly 5,500 cases each year overall). High levels of drinking are thought to trigger liver cancer because this causes conditions – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cirrhosis</span></a> – that damage the liver’s ability to repair itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Public knowledge of alcohol guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the public may not be too well informed about the health risks associated with drinking alcohol. If this is the case, simply offering new guidelines on drinking isn’t going to be enough to help people to understand the health risks.</p>
<p>But they are a good place to start. It’s the duty of the government to inform the public of health risks, and provide these guidelines to help people make decisions about their own health.</p>
<p>The new guidelines are clear that there is no safe level of drinking when it comes to cancer risk. But our study suggests that awareness of the risks needs to improve if the guidelines are going to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Until the recent announcement, the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/1536/153605.htm"><span style="color: #0066cc;">government’s alcohol guidelines</span></a> had not been reviewed since 1995.</p>
<p>Our survey reveals that even  though the guidelines haven’t changed in 20 years, only one in 10 men and one in seven women could correctly identify the guidelines for their own gender, and reported using this sometimes to keep track of their own drinking.</p>
<p>Now that the guidelines have changed to 14 units per week for both men and women, can we expect the public to know what they are? Our survey suggests that, without further work, this is unlikely.</p>
<p>So it’s important we – and others – continue to raise awareness of the health risks of drinking alcohol, and especially the links to cancer.</p>
<p>By helping people understand the guidelines, we hope that people will feel they have the information they need to make decisions about when they choose to drink, and how much. And that ultimately this will lead to a healthier nation.</p>

            <img alt="Dorsal view of the brain of a 10-day old double transgenic zebrafish (MRC1a:eGFP; Kdrl:mcherry). Blood vessels are shown in magenta and a novel population of perivascular endothelial cells are shown in green.   Credit: B. Weinstein, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/29229314884_08cfd981e7_z-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p style="text-align: justify;">The brain is a complex and mysterious organ, which performs many functions and the proper functioning of this precious machine is important for well-being. There are about 86 billion neurons in the brain and they interact by forming circuits. Therefore, it is critical to understand the structural organization and the neural circuits underlying brain functions. However, a major obstacle to study and understand the brain lies in the fact that it is densely composed of lipids, due to which the light is scattered and cannot penetrate inside. Thus, the high lipid content makes it difficult to image the whole brain. The traditional method to image the brain is to slice it into thin sections (µm) followed by histological staining and imaging but this is a time-consuming, error-prone process, and there is/might be loss of information as only the surface of sections can be imaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, modern approaches involve clearing the brain of the lipids and make it optically transparent so that light can pass through the brain without sectioning. There are several different clearing processes like CLARITY (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013), SWITCH (Murray et al., 2015), CUBIC (Susaki et al., 2015), 3DISCO (Ertürk et al., 2012), uDISCO (Pan et al., 2016) and many more which clear the lipids and make the brain optically transparent. With the discovery of these processes, scientists have even imaged a complete rodent (Pan et al., 2016) and its whole brain (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013; Pan et al., 2016).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19026" style="width: 416px;"><img alt="1" class="wp-image-19026" height="210" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/1.jpg" width="416" />Figure 1 – Comparison between (a) normal brain and (b) cleared brain using CLARITY.</figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most popular and commonly used clearing method is CLARITY (Clear Lipid-exchanged Acrylamide-hybridized Rigid Imaging Tissue hYdrogel) (figure 1) which was developed at Karl Deisseroth’s laboratory, who also pioneered the discovery of Optogenetics (Boyden et al., 2005). CLARITY uses SDS, a detergent to get rid of the lipids using electrical charges. Initially, the animal is perfused with formaldehyde in combination with acrylamide which in turn forms a hydrogel layer. The brain is infused with a hydrogel solution and then incubated. At the end of the process, CLARITY produces a structurally intact but transparent tissue. However, with CLARITY, multiple rounds of labeling are not possible and is limited to three rounds of immunolabeling. Also, after electrophoresis, the tissue expands from their normal size but return to its normal size after refractive index matching (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013). However, no loss of information due to the expansion and shrinkage has been reported.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many modifications have been made to CLARITY including passive CLARITY (Tomer et al., 2014). More recently, Kwang Chung, who is credited with the discovery of CLARITY, developed SWITCH (system wide control of interaction time and kinetics of chemicals). SWITCH provides an advantage since it allows multiple round (&gt; 20) of labeling steps and a uniform tissue processing, thus providing access to high dimensional multi-scale information (Murray et al., 2015). Another major advantage of SWITCH is that it doesn’t require the animals to undergo perfusion and can be used both in small and big animals and even human samples and SWITCH doesn’t require any special equipment or reagents (Murray et al., 2015).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19027" style="width: 340px;"><img alt="2" class="wp-image-19027 " height="265" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/2-300x234.jpg" width="340" />Figure 2: The nervous system projections imaged in the intact mouse brain with CLARITY. Adapted from Chung et al.</figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative approach to CLARITY or  SWITCH is a solvent-based method known as 3DISCO (Three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs) which removes lipids and makes the tissue optically transparent by using organic solvents like Dibenzyl Ether (DBE) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF). By using 3DISCO, the organ of interest shrinks to half of its size which is convenient for imaging rats because of their big size, and it has been reported that there is no loss of information. A modified version of 3DISCO, was recently developed by Erturk et al. and is known as uDISCO or ‘ultimate DISCO’. uDISCO uses Diphenyl Ether (DPE), instead of DBE. DPE is less prone to radical and oxidative reactions as it lacks benzylic C-H and C-O bonds (Pan et al., 2016). Fluorescence is better preserved in DPE as compared to DBE and provides a better tissue-clearing effect (Pan et al., 2016). Therefore, DPE is more suitable for clearing process compared to DBE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With access to high resolution microscopes, like 2-photon or light sheet microscopy, it is now possible to image a complete brain within a matter of hours. A recent development in microscopy known as expansion microscopy (Chen et al., 2015) can also be used to image cleared tissues which is based on the infusion of Sodium polyacrylate into the tissue. Interestingly, this molecule is also used in baby diapers and as a result the diapers expand due to diffusion of liquid into it. Based on the same principle, expansion microscopy also expands the tissue samples by 100 folds without changing the molecular structures and it has been used to image cells and synapses in the mouse hippocampus (Chen et al., 2015)<span style="font-size: small;"> </span>and also has been used to image RNA structure (Chen et al., 2016).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Table 1" class="wp-image-19028 aligncenter" height="195" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/Table-1-300x126.jpg" width="464" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advent of clearing techniques and advanced microscopy system has made possible to image the whole brain in pathological conditions in order to deeply understand the underlying aberrant changes occurring at the level of neural networks and connections. Recently, clearing methods have been successfully used to image brains in severe disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Ando et al., 2014) and multiple sclerosis (Spence et al., 2014). With these techniques, it would now be possible to comprehend some of the brain secrets and to unveil how this beautiful organ works.</p>

<p>Much attention has been focused recently on whether brain training programmes have the far-reaching benefits claimed by their commercial purveyors. Brain training usually involves completing exercises on computer to strengthen your working memory – essentially your ability to hold in mind and process multiple items of information at once (“cognitive training” would be a more apt name). The argument put forward by brain training companies like Lumosity and Posit Science, is that working memory is such a fundamental mental process that if you boost your working memory capacity through training, then you will experience wide-ranging benefits, even in ostensibly unrelated activities, such as in your performance at work. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">a comprehensive review</a> published earlier this year concluded that there is in fact inadequate evidence to justify such bold claims. Now <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13421-016-0629-4">a study</a> in <em>Memory and Cognition</em> brings even worse news for brain training enthusiasts – compared to control conditions, working memory training was actually found to <em>worsen</em> performance on a test of recognition memory.<span id="more-14518"></span></p>
<p>Laura Matzen and her colleagues recruited 86 male and female participants (average age 37), all employees at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the first week of the study, the researchers tested the participants’ baseline performance on recognition memory (the ability to study several dozen words, one at a time, and then judge in a subsequent test which words they’d seen and which were new); and on verbal and spatial working memory (this involved recalling sequences of symbols while also judging whether sentences made sense or not, and the spatial version involved remembering the order and location of shapes in a grid).</p>
<p>The next three weeks were spent training. Some of the participants were allocated to working memory training, which involved spending half an hour a day, four days a week, on a version of the <em>n</em>-back task (the kind of task that features in many brain-training programmes). Participants had to look at streams of letters on a screen and look out for whenever the current item was the same as the one a certain number (<em>n</em>) of items earlier. The better participants performed, the harder the task became by requiring they attend to earlier items in the sequence. Other participants were allocated to three weekly sessions of mental imagery training, in which they were taught, and practised, converting to-be-remembered words into memorable images. Finally, the remainder of the participants were allocated to a no-training control condition.</p>
<p>During the fifth and final week of the study, all participants repeated the original baseline tests of working memory and recognition memory, and the researchers compared the participants’ performance with their earlier baseline. The researchers also asked participants about what learning strategies they’d used in these final tests, if any, such as mental rehearsal of to-be-remembered words or imagery techniques.</p>
<p>All the participants showed improvement in the later test of working memory, but this improvement was no greater in the working memory training group compared with the other groups, which means there was no evidence that working memory training had any specific benefits on working memory performance. But arguably more worrying still for brain training advocates is that whereas the control group showed equal performance on the later recognition memory test compared with baseline, and the imagery training group showed improvements compared with baseline, the working memory training group actually deteriorated in their recognition memory performance.</p>
<p>Why would working memory training worsen recognition memory performance? Some clues come from the participants’ comments about their use of strategies – those in the working memory training group were more likely than others to say they used a “shallow” strategy such as simple mental repetition (not very effective when studying dozens of words), or no strategy at all. The researchers speculated that perhaps the experience of working memory training discourages us from using effective strategies, maybe because it encourages a confidence in and reliance on one’s basic memory processes.</p>
<p>A potential criticism of the study is that the working memory training was much more time consuming that the mental imagery training, potentially leaving the participants in the working memory condition more tired and demotivated by the time of the final tests. However, there was little evidence to support this interpretation – for example, drop out from the study was no greater in the working memory condition than other groups, and remember participants who completed the working memory training showed comparable performance to others on the final tests of working memory.</p>
<p>This is just one study with a relatively small sample and it only used one kind of test to measure recognition memory performance, so it shouldn’t be treated as decisive evidence. However, Matzen and her team said their findings are worrying because recognition memory performance is so important to many real-life challenges, especially in educational settings. “The results present a cautionary tale about unintended consequences arising from cognitive training,” they said. “Even if participants improve on the trained task, the training may impact their performance on untrained tasks in unforeseen ways.”</p>

<p>As a child, my earliest memories were those living in foreign countries. Though born in the United States, my childhood was mostly spent living abroad due to my father’s work (who was a civil servant for the U.S. military). This included tours in the Philippines, Greece, Germany, and visiting Japan every year to see my maternal grandparents and relatives. It wasn’t until middle school that I would return to the United States, then experiencing the strange feeling of being a foreigner in my own “home” country.</p>
<p>However, the most profound impact of this experience was how it widened my perspective on the shared challenges we face as a global society and how it taught me that health is a common value that transcends national boundaries. Regardless of the different communities and countries I lived in and visited, all had a longing for the “attainment” of health and wellness, yet many did not have the means to ensure a healthier present or future.</p>
<p>This was especially true when I returned to the United States. We moved back to a community that had radically changed and shifted in socioeconomic demographics. The difference was drastic with our neighborhoods plagued with violence, substance abuse, failing schools, and all the signs of poverty, including lack of healthcare access and poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>This experience led me to a career in global health. I realized that improving population health through research, advocacy, and policy making is something that all communities need, whether it be local or global.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your research interests in global health?</em></strong></p>
<p>My primary research interests are looking at the impact of policy and governance on a variety of domestic and global health issues. This interest reflects my multidisciplinary background, which includes degrees in political science, health policy and law, and a doctorate in Global Public Health. It is also informed by where and the people I have worked with, which includes over 10 years’ experience in the private sector, my current career in academia, and consulting for organizations such as the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the U.S. Department of State, among others.</p>
<p>The reason why I am so interested in policy and governance is that it impacts everything around us. Global health programs cannot be successful without appropriate governance that enables them to effectuate sustainable change or prevent health emergencies. We are seeing this play out now with widespread scrutiny and calls for reform of the WHO following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, a topic I explore in a recent <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2016-y">article</a> published in <em>BMC Infectious Diseases.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, health interventions cannot be effective unless policy frameworks support their design and implementation.  Simply put, if you don’t understand the policy environment, then you may not understand why your public health program, research, or intervention is working or not working, or why it may not be translating to have the desired impact.</p>
<p>Studying policy also allows me to traverse a wide-range of topics and interests in domestic and global health, keeping me both interested and busy at all times.  This includes publishing on subjects including pharmaceutical regulation, eHealth, substance abuse, environmental health, drug safety and quality, innovation and intellectual property, infectious diseases, cancer policy, health and migration, health diplomacy, and health corruption.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where do you see the field of global health moving towards in the 21<sup>st</sup> century?</em></strong></p>
<p>The strength of global health and why it represents a field of study that can address our most pressing global challenges (from the threat of infectious disease outbreaks to the impact of climate change on planetary health) is its multidisciplinary nature.  Global health should be a “safe space” where all types of stakeholders and disciplines can come together to address complex problems from their own unique perspectives but sharing the same goal of advancing human health and development.</p>
<p>A unifying governance framework that can bring us together towards advancing global health are the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many of which are cross-cutting and encourage partnership among different sectors of global society.  For this reason, the journal welcomes submissions that assess key component of the SDGs (including measuring progress to SDG goals, assessing appropriate indicators, and thinking creatively about how the SDGs are a global instrument that can effectuate positive and sustainable change).</p>
<p>Technology can also serve as an agnostic and unifying structure that can address health problems that are borderless.  This includes the emergence of eHealth as its own distinct field of study.  Hence, we would encourage submissions that look at new digital tools, solutions, methods, and interventions that can improve population health.  The potential to leverage eHealth to advance global health are virtually endless, though these technologies need to think about public health as a priority not a secondary outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we welcome submissions and research addressing global health challenges in low and low-middle-income countries.  As a global academic community, we need more visibility to the acute challenges of communities who stand to benefit the most from the promotion of global health.</p>

            Airline travel during the holidays is one big headache. But for some people, “airplane headache” is a truly painful experience. The headache occurs during take-off and landing, is unique to plane travel, and is not associated with other conditions. The pain is severe, with a jabbing or stabbing quality, and located on one side of the head (usually around the eye sockets or forehead).

<p>Many of our relationships begin with that moment when our eyes meet and we realise the other person is looking right at us. Pause for a second and consider the intensity of the situation, the near-magical state of two brains simultaneously processing one another, each aware of being, at that very instant, the centre of the other’s mental world. Psychologists have made some surprising discoveries about the way that mutual gaze, or the lack of it, affects us mentally and physically and how we relate to each other. Here we digest the fascinating psychology of eye contact, from tiny babies’ sensitivity to gaze to the hallucination-inducing effects of prolonged eye-staring.</p>
<p><span id="more-14240"></span></p>
<p>Our sensitivity to eye contact begins incredibly early. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11293433_Eye_contact_detection_in_humans_from_birth">Infants of just two days of age prefer looking at faces that gaze back at them</a>. Similarly, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/16208">recordings of the brain activity of four-month-olds</a> show that they process gazing faces more deeply than faces that are looking away; and at 7-months, infants’ brains process eye contact differently from averted gaze even when the eyes are shown for just 50ms – far too quick for any kind of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Most children recognise the social significance of eye contact, but they seem to take it too far. At the age of three and four, for instance, they often believe that so long as they cover their eyes – thus preventing eye contact – that they will be completely hidden from view. In fact, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/23/why-do-children-hide-by-covering-their-eyes/">children will often claim to be hidden even if they simply avert their gaze while another person looks at them</a>.</p>
<p>Children with autism often show a noticeable lack of eye contact and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1995.tb00687.x/abstract">part of the reason</a> is their difficulty understanding the social significance of another person’s gaze, and that they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414711">find it difficult to infer other people’s mental state from their eyes</a>.</p>
<p>As adults, locking eyes with another person <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/26/eye-contact-makes-us-more-aware-of-our-own-bodies/">immediately triggers in us a state of increased self-consciousness</a>. Researchers showed this by asking participants to rate their own emotional reactions to various positive and negative images, some of which were preceded by a face staring straight at them, others by a face with gaze averted. Participants had more insight into their own emotional reactions (which were measured objectively through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity">galvanic skin response</a>) after they’d made eye contact with a face. “Our results support the view that human adults’ bodily awareness becomes more acute when they are subjected to another’s gaze,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In fact, eye contact is such an intense experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/18/why-its-hard-to-talk-and-make-eye-contact-at-the-same-time/">it even seems to consume extra brain power</a>, making it difficult to perform other challenging mental tasks at the same time. This year a pair of Japanese researchers tested participants on a verb generation task while at the same time they looked at a realistic on-screen face that was either making eye contact with them or had its gaze averted. Making eye contact impaired the participants’ performance on the hardest version of the verb generation task, presumably because it consumed spare brain power that might otherwise have been available to support performance on the verbal task.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who mostly know instinctively to break eye contact to help concentrate on what they’re saying, children will tend to maintain gaze even when asked a difficult question. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/01/05/helping-children-by-teaching-them-to-look-away/">Developmental psychologists have shown that children can benefit from being trained to avert their gaze to help them think things through more clearly</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not other people make eye contact with us changes the way that we think about them and their feelings. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615320">we are more likely to remember faces with which we’ve experienced mutual gaze</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755215">we consider displays of anger and joy to be more intense when shown by a person making eye contact</a>. In fact, when a person or human-like entity (such as a human face morphed with a doll) makes eye contact with us, <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/42/12/1666.full">we assume that he/she/it has a more sophisticated mind</a> and a greater ability to act in the world, such as to show self-control and act morally, and a greater desire for social contact.</p>
<p>Indeed, such is the importance of eye contact to socialising that we tend to form rather low opinions of people who persistently avoid our gaze, assuming that they are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-34932-001">less sincere</a> and, at least if they’re female, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886996001481">less conscientious</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643789">we’re more likely to believe statements made by a person who looks us in the eye</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.psychopathicwritings.com/2011/06/truth-or-myth-psychopathic-stare-part-5.html">maintaining eye contact with <em>too much</em> intensity is seen as a feature of psychopaths</a>.</p>
<p>To try to identity the optimum length of unbroken eye contact to make, psychologists recruited participants at London’s Science Museum and asked them to rate how comfortable they found different lengths of eye contact made by faces shown in video clips, ranging from between 100ms (a tenth of a second) to 10,300ms (just over ten seconds). <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/07/psychologists-have-identified-the-length-of-eye-contact-that-people-find-most-comfortable/">On average, the participants were most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to deciding whether we trust another person, it turns out that it’s not only a question of how much eye contact they make, but also what we see in their eyes. Remarkably, <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.full">it seems that we pay attention at a subconscious level to the behaviour of their pupils</a>, and if they dilate – a sign of attraction and emotional arousal – we judge them to be more trustworthy, whereas if they constrict – a sign of fear or feeling threatened – then we judge them less trustworthy. Also, when we trust a partner with dilating pupils, our own pupils tend to mimic theirs and show similar dilation.</p>
<p>We think poorly of conversation partners who consistently avoid eye contact, but it is our feelings of belonging that are hurt when a stranger looks our way and deliberately avoids meeting our eyes – an experience captured by the German expression “wie Luft behandeln”, which means to be looked at as though air. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/13/0956797611427921.full">Psychologists demonstrated this in a field study on their university campus</a>, in which they subjected passersby to the “wie Luft behandeln” experience after which they reported feeling disconnected from others.</p>
<p>Thankfully we seem to have an inbuilt defence mechanism to avoid these feelings of disconnection when we’re already feeling rejected. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/">Psychologists showed us this</a> by prompting some participants to feel ostracised in a game of online ball passing, and then asking them to judge whether a series of faces were looking right at them or not. Compared with control participants, those feeling ostracised were more likely to believe that other faces were making eye contact with them, even if in truth their eyes were slightly averted.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems extreme eye contact can lead to some very strange psychological effects. If you and a partner look into each other’s eyes for 10 minutes while sitting in a dimly lit room, you are likely to experience odd sensations that resemble mild “dissociation” – a psychological term for when people lose their normal connection with reality. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">When the Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo tested these effects for a paper published in 2015</a>, he found that participants experienced odd feelings of time slowing down, sounds seeming quiet or loud, and 90 per cent said they’d seen some deformed facial features, 75 per cent said they’d seen a monster, 50 per cent said they saw aspects of their own face in their partner’s face, and 15 per cent said they’d seen a relative’s face.</p>
<p>The meeting of minds and souls that occurs through eye contact can be a wonderful thing, but is perhaps best practised in moderation, or at least in full daylight!</p>

 Wild and managed pollinators provide a wide range of benefits to society in terms of contributions to food security, farmer and beekeeper livelihoods, social and cultural values, as well as the maintenance of wider biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Pollinators face numerous threats, including changes in land-use and management intensity, climate change, pesticides and genetically modified crops, pollinator management and pathogens, and invasive alien species. There are well-documented declines in some wild and managed pollinators in several regions of the world. However, many effective policy and management responses can be implemented to safeguard pollinators and sustain pollination services.

 Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) exhibits divergent effects in skeletal muscle. At physiological levels, signalling through this receptor promotes muscle development in growing embryos and angiogenesis in regenerating adult muscle. However, both increased PDGF ligand abundance and enhanced PDGFRα pathway activity cause pathological fibrosis. This excessive collagen deposition, which is seen in aged and diseased muscle, interferes with muscle function and limits the effectiveness of gene- and cell-based therapies for muscle disorders. Although compelling evidence exists for the role of PDGFRα in fibrosis, little is known about the cells through which this pathway acts. Here we show in mice that PDGFRα signalling regulates a population of muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) that play a supportive role in muscle regeneration but may also cause fibrosis when aberrantly regulated. We found that FAPs produce multiple transcriptional variants of Pdgfra with different polyadenylation sites, including an intronic variant that codes for a protein isoform containing a truncated kinase domain. This variant, upregulated during regeneration, acts as a decoy to inhibit PDGF signalling and to prevent FAP over-activation. Moreover, increasing the expression of this isoform limits fibrosis in vivo in mice, suggesting both biological relevance and therapeutic potential of modulating polyadenylation patterns in stem-cell populations.

            <p>Body mass index (BMI) has been linked to inflammation, and systemic inflammation has been linked to decreased cognition. Now, a new study directly links a high BMI to lower cognitive functioning. The current study, published in the journal <em>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</em>, is the first step in identifying a biologically plausible mechanism for the connection between BMI and cognition.    </p>
<p>The authors evaluated 2 cohorts of people aged 50 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging. One group contained 9000 people and the other contained approximately 12,500.</p>
<p>When the authors correlated BMI, inflammatory markers, and cognition over a 6-year period, the results in both groups were the same: higher BMI was associated with greater cognitive decline. </p>
<p>Specifically, the higher the BMI at the beginning of the study, the greater increase in levels of inflammatory markers (specifically, C-reactive protein [CRP]) over the next 4 years. The change in CRP predicted greater decline in memory and executive functioning over the following 2 years (a total of 6 years from the start of the study.) Established literature already links inflammation to cognitive decline, but these findings take it a step further by highlighting the role of BMI in systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Physical activity and body mass are related to cognitive function in adults. BMI is a function of body mass (i.e., weight) and height, and most data reveal an inverse relationship between physical activity and BMI. Likewise, regular exercise has been shown to prevent cognitive decline in adults who are middle aged and older. </p>
<p>The relationship between physical activity and BMI, however, is nuanced because BMI does not account for a person’s amounts of body fat or muscle mass, both of which can skew the calculation. Still, the general trends are intuitive: engage in more physical activity, decrease body weight, lower BMI, and improve cognition.</p>
<p>In the current study, BMI, by way of inflammation, predicted cognitive decline. While no absolute criteria are reported for preventing cognitive decline, the authors provide one more reason – if one is even needed – to maintain an appropriate body weight and levels of physical activity. Changes in cognition related to aging often take years – even decades – to appear, so a healthy BMI at younger ages may prevent cognitive changes years later.</p>
<p>A recent landmark study indicated that healthy lifestyle habits were cumulative in their protective effects against cognitive decline, asserting that exercise and maintaining health body weight were important for 20 years before the onset of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Healthy BMI is correlated to decreased risks of many diseases and conditions that affect most of the major body’s major organ systems. Now, simply reducing BMI may be a simple, low-cost intervention to decrease the burden of cognitive impairment.</p>

            Is it the job of peer reviewers to detect scientific fraud?



I've been pondering this question for a while but lately my interest was sparked by the case of a retracted cancer biology paper in the high-profile journal Nature Cell Biology. Written by Taiwanese researchers Shih-Ting Cha et al., the article was published on the 15th August and retracted just three months later, after anonymous posters on PubPeer noticed several anomalies in the results.

For instance, there was image duplic

            <p>Keeping up with research publications is always a challenge for researchers. There's simply too much going on. Most of us have a daily or maybe hebdomadal slot where we go over various journals and news. We use things like e-mail alerts, RSS feeds, and that sort of thing. I have a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/feedlists">rather long list of RSS feeds</a> set up in the excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://lzone.de/liferea/">Liferea</a> reader myself.</p>
<p>Now, the one problem with using a desktop application is that it must be set up on every machine that you use - even on your phone. This isn't ideal, really. It is also not ideal that we all end up having our own private lists. So, I thought it'd be nicer if I could set something up on the web that we could all access from everywhere without needing an app. The simple choice was to use <a class="reference external" href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">venus</a> to set up <em>planet</em> instances.</p>
<p>Those that have been around the free and open source community will already know what planets are. They're web pages that aggregate feeds from various sources - usually community members' blogs. There are quite a few around and I follow a few myself -  <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Planet Fedora</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.mozilla.org/">Planet Mozilla</a>, for example. They're extremely useful to keep onesself up to date with the happenings in the communities.</p>
<p>So, I've gone ahead and set up two new planet instances to aggregate information from a myriad of neuroscience sources. The first is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/">Planet neuroscience</a>. The feeds this one aggregates are all from peer reviewed journals. So, pure research on this one. It's one long list of new publications.</p>
<p>The second one is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/">Planet neuroscientists</a>. On this one, I collect posts from various neuroscience news sites and blogs. Quite a few of these sources help make neuroscience more accessible by summarising concepts and results. They also discuss more general topics such as the research method, collaboration, open access, and the sort. So, these are also quite useful to read.</p>
<p>I hope that these two planet instances will help us keep up to date with neuroscience research with less effort than before. They're both hosted on Github and are therefore, public pages. I don't reckon there'd be any bandwidth issues either. They're just static pages. Please do give them a go to see if you find them useful and of course, please spread the word too.</p>
<p>At the moment, I have a cron job that updates them once daily, and I've put up some initial source that I was already following. If you know of any other sources that are worth following too, please do get in touch with me. The themes are extremely simple. You can always open pull requests if you'd like to make them better.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and do drop me a line if you find these new planets useful!</p>

<p>Imagine it: you’re happily surfing through your social media feeds – or what we nowadays call your filter bubble – when some unexpected perspectives somehow manage to penetrate. After you “like” the latest critique of police power, for instance, you come across an article arguing that cracking down on crime can benefit minority neighborhoods. Or, elbowing its way into a crowd of articles celebrating trickle-down economics, you encounter a study showing higher taxes boost growth. What happens next? In <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X16300455">new research</a> in <em>Contemporary Educational Psychology</em>, Gregory Trevors and his colleagues looked at how reading conflicting information can push our emotional buttons, and lead us either towards resistance or a chance to learn.</p>
<p><span id="more-14222"></span></p>
<p>Nearly three hundred students from various Canadian and American universities first indicated their “epistemic beliefs” – that is, their beliefs about how knowledge comes about, such as whether facts are eternal or open to question. Next they read a series of texts on climate change, ordered in a way to maximize dissonance. To begin, an article emphasised anthropogenic change due to human-produced climate gases. To follow, an article emphasised how climate change has been greatly shaped by astronomical causes beyond our control. This “natural cycles” take was then upended by an article on catastrophic consequences of the current climate trend, and then one final switcheroo – a description of how rising temperatures will produce some global opportunities.</p>
<p>After each article, the participants indicated how strongly they felt emotions like frustration, confusion or surprise. At the end, each participant had to synthesise what they had got out of the texts by writing a short summary, which was analysed by text-matching algorithms and human judges to see when participants were prepared to integrate controversial texts, and when they preferred to stick to a simple narrative.</p>
<p>Different beliefs about knowledge led to different emotional reactions, and to different ways of handling the text. For example, for readers who said they believed you can’t verify knowledge based on gut feelings, but need to contrast and compare across many sources, the jarring text on astronomical causes of climate change led to greater feelings of surprise and curiosity. In turn, these feelings appeared to motivate them to take in this new information as shown by the way their summaries acknowledged multiple viewpoints.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the participants who endorsed the idea that knowledge comes to us as food does to baby birds, offered by an authority figure for our easy digestion, felt confused when faced with the prospect of multiple authorities. Confusion makes it harder to take in and remember information, and this appeared to take place here, as these participants’ summaries turned out to be more monotone and lacked reference to the controversial information.</p>
<p>Not every belief turned out to have the expected effect – in particular, believing that knowledge is certain, led participants to experience less surprise, not more, when confronted with contradictions. The researchers speculated that perhaps these participants simply hadn’t engaged with the text enough to take in its implications.</p>
<p>Although we shouldn’t allow our models of the world to be battered around by every spurious claim, the intelligent approach is to acknowledge credibly sourced evidenced-based arguments – especially those that dissent from the dominant narrative. This research shows us how this process can be obstructed by how we feel, and suggests two solutions for educators and influencers. The first is to anticipate the likely reactions to <em>this specific argument</em>: consider where and how your audience might be disengaging due to their emotional feelings and shape your message to redress this. The second is to try to <em>shift how people actually think about</em> <em>knowledge itself,</em> by referencing the robust evidence underlying your claims, linking to counter-evidence and explicitly weighing different sources. You won’t always win minds on the specific argument, but you might open minds, to the benefit of all the conversations to come.</p>

            <p>There are certainly different types of drunks. “Sober Dave is boring, you should hang out with Drunk Dave, he’s wild!” or “She is usually a sweetheart, but watch out, she’s a mean drunk”.  Having documented the transition to our drunk alter-egos for 100s of years, we are no strangers to the concept of drunk personality types. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that alcohol can change our personalities from a sober type to a drunk type.    </p>
<p>Today, research pioneered by University of Missouri graduate student, Rachel Winograd, supports the existence of at least 4 categories of drunk personalities. Importantly, she reveals if one’s type of drunk personality puts them at greater risk of alcohol-related harms (e.g. regrettable sexual encounters or drunken injuries), as well as alcohol addiction. </p>
<p>187 pairs of undergraduate drinking buddies answered questions linking their drunk personality to the “big five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). Cluster analysis of these answers led to the description of four main drunk personality types as outlined below. </p>
<p>Not only is it a bit of fun to ask, “What kind of drunk are you?”, the drunk personality research field holds promise for the development of novel interventions to help problem drinkers.</p>

<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Ernest Hemmingway" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/ernest-hemmingway-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>As Ernest Hemingway wrote, he ‘‘can drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk.” Thankfully, this is the most common drunk personality type shared by 42% of the undergrads, who reported behaving roughly the same and only slightly changing when intoxicated.  </p>
<p>Compared to the other personality types, the personality factors that tend to change the most when drunk — i.e. conscientiousness (being prepared, organized, prompt) and intellect ( understanding abstract ideas, being imaginative) — do not change drastically.  It is no surprise then that this drunk personality type was not linked with experiencing more negative consequences or alcoholism symptoms. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type 2: The Mr Hyde</strong><strong> </strong></p><strong>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mr Hyde" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/Mr-Hyde-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second most common drunk personality type (23% of the sample) is the monster of a drunk named after the twisted alter-ego of Dr. Jeckyll, Mr. Hyde. They are characterized by being less conscientious, less intellectual and less agreeable than their sober selves or other drunk personality types.</p>
<p>Their drunk personality being the perfect recipe for increased hostility when under the influence, they are statistically more likely to have alcohol use disorder symptoms (i.e. have a higher risk of alcohol addiction). They also suffer a whole range of negative consequences from drinking, from blacking out to being arrested for drunken behaviour. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type  3: The Nutty Professor</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Nutty Professor" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/nutty-professor-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>This type of drunk, comprising 20% of the study participants, does a personality 360 when they get drunk. They are particularly quiet and introverted when sober, but their drunken persona has a large increase in extraversion and decrease in conscientiousness (compared to the other drunk types and their sober self). This is likened to the the Disney character, Shermen Clump, when he transforms from taking his secret chemical formula in <em>The Nutty Professor</em>.</p>
<p>Despite having the most drastic personality change, Nutty Professors were not associated with experiencing more negative alcohol-related consequences from drinking. </p>
</strong><p><strong><strong>Drunk Personality Type 4: The Mary Poppins</strong></strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mary Poppins" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-poppins-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>The least common drunk personality type in the study, found in 15% of the participants, was ‘The Mary Poppins. They are not only particularly agreeable (i.e. embodying traits of friendliness)when sober, they are also agreeable and friendly when drunk. Like Hemmingways, they also decrease less than average in conscientiousness and intellect when getting drunk. </p>
<p>Their drunken sweetness sets them apart from less agreeable Hemmingways. They are essentially the opposite of the Mr Hyde drunk type of drunk, resulting in significantly less negative consequences from getting drunk. </p>

<p>Television programs portraying ordinary people in unexpected situations are almost as old as the medium of television itself. First aired in 1984, <em>Candid Camera</em> is often seen as a prototype of the reality show. Its premise was simple – unsuspecting people were confronted with unusual, funny situations and filmed with hidden cameras. However, the genre exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and 2000s with the global success of such series as <em>Survivor</em>, <em>Idol</em>, and <em>Big Brother</em>, and to this day many people continue to abandon their own activities for the voyeuristic other.</p>
<p>Reality shows have not only amassed incredible popularity but have also become an object of severe, wide-ranging criticism. Among the most serious complaints is the allegation that the shows rely on viewers’ enjoyment of the humiliation and degradation of participants. It is quite difficult to find an individual who is indifferent to such programmes. We either hate reality shows or we watch them, quite often without considering why.</p>
<p>Up until now, scholarly opinion on the subject has been divided. Some maintain that the shows’ appeal constitutes an extension of fictional drama, and is thus driven by positive feelings like empathy and compassion. Others claim that reality TV viewers are driven by a voyeuristic desire to intrude on others and to see them in their most private and embarrassing moments. Michal Hershman Shitrit and Jonathan Cohen from University of Haifa in Israel recently tested these contrasting perspectives for a <a href="http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105/a000186">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Media Psychology</em>.<span id="more-14195"></span></p>
<p>They surveyed 183 participants about 12 different reality shows including local versions of well-known productions such as <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>American Idol</em>, <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em>, <em>Master Chef</em>, and <em>Super Nanny</em>. Participants stated how often they watched each show, how much they enjoyed the shows, the extent to which they would want to participate if offered a chance, how happy they would be if a family member was interested in participating, etc. Among the most important questions were ones involving self-disclosure (items asked to what extent one would reveal to a stranger various types of information, such as “Your personal habits” or “Things you have done and feel guilty about.”), as the researchers hypothesized that self-disclosure would be positively correlated with one’s own willingness to participate in reality shows.</p>
<p>The idea behind the questions about loved ones participating was to measure attitudes towards participation at a slight distance, independent from the respondents’ own personality traits and willingness to participate. Shitrit and Cohen assumed that if people do not wish to be humiliated or see their loved ones publicly humiliated, and at the same time they enjoy reality shows for the humiliation involved, one would expect a negative correlation between enjoyment and willingness to participate. If, on the other hand, empathy is the main reason why people enjoy these shows, the correlation should be positive.</p>
<p>Overall, interest in participating in reality shows was not very high, but crucially, the more that participants said they enjoyed the shows, the more likely they were to say that they’d like to participate, or for a loved one to participate. Unsurprisingly, participants who scored highly in the self-disclosure measure also tended to be more interested in participating in reality shows. On the whole, approval for family members’ participation in reality shows was higher than the desire for self-participation.</p>
<p>Shitrit and Cohen concluded that this tricky and innovative test of the real reasons behind enjoyment of reality shows allowed them to discover that humiliation is not the central motivation, which must rather be empathy.</p>
<p>Are these findings good news for all those who enjoy reality shows and for those who would like to perceive human creatures as good and positive? I would not be so eager to shout the good news to the whole world. Humans are quite complex creatures. Not only do we love others, but quite often we do not like some of them, and at times even hate them. I wonder what results would be generated by a study in which we asked participants not about their loved ones, but rather those they despised? Isn’t it true that we are overly optimistic not only about ourselves but also about our loved ones, and we can’t imagine that we or they would find themselves in embarrassing situations? Conversely, isn’t it the case that we would like to see our enemies embarrass themselves, and we can easily imagine this occurring? In which case, surely it’s possible that we enjoy reality shows in part because of feeling empathy and sympathy when watching participants we like, while at the same time finding enjoyment in seeing those we do not like in their most humiliating and embarrassing moments?</p>
<p>I think that before we trumpet to the whole world the researchers’ “good news” interpretation of their study, it would be desirable to get answers to these questions first.</p>

 In tackling the obesity pandemic, significant efforts are devoted to the development of effective weight reduction strategies, yet many dieting individuals fail to maintain a long-term weight reduction, and instead undergo excessive weight regain cycles. The mechanisms driving recurrent post-dieting obesity remain largely elusive. Here, we identify an intestinal microbiome signature that persists after successful dieting of obese mice, which contributes to faster weight regain and metabolic aberrations upon re-exposure to obesity-promoting conditions and transmits the accelerated weight regain phenotype upon inter-animal transfer. We develop a machine-learning algorithm that enables personalized microbiome-based prediction of the extent of post-dieting weight regain. Additionally, we find that the microbiome contributes to diminished post-dieting flavonoid levels and reduced energy expenditure, and demonstrate that flavonoid-based ‘post-biotic’ intervention ameliorates excessive secondary weight gain. Together, our data highlight a possible microbiome contribution to accelerated post-dieting weight regain, and suggest that microbiome-targeting approaches may help to diagnose and treat this common disorder.

            <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.med.uio.no/klinmed/english/people/aca/tuomomm/">Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen</a> joins us for a special journal club session this week.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The recent progress in electrophysiological and optical methods for neuronal recordings provides vast amounts of high-resolution data. In parallel, the development of computer technology has allowed simulating ever larger neuronal circuits. A challenge in taking advantage of these developments is the construction of single-cell and network models in a way that faithfully reproduces neuronal biophysics with subcellular level of details while keeping the simulation costs at an acceptable level. In this talk, I will present our work on a stepwise method for fitting a neuron model to data with fine spatial resolution, such as that achievable with voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and Ca2+ imaging.</p>
<p>We applied our method to simulated data from layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) and constructed a model with reduced neuronal morphology. We connected the reduced-morphology neurons into a network and validated against simulated data from a high-resolution L5PC network model. The reduced-morphology neuron model obtained using our approach reliably reproduced the membrane potential dynamics across the dendrites as predicted by the full-morphology model, and was more than 20 times faster to simulate. The network models produced using our method are cost-efficient and predict that interconnected L5PCs, largely due to the medium afterhyperpolarization mediated by the Ca2+-activated SK current, are able to amplify delta-range oscillatory inputs across a large range of network sizes and topologies.</p>

<p>When you sign your name, do you like to fill the available space with bold strokes or is your personal scribble a more modest mark?  A group of psychologists from Uruguay, the Netherlands and Curaçao say that the answer could be a sign of your personality – from analysing the traits and signatures of 192 women and 148 men (psych students in Uruguay), they found that men and women with bigger signatures tended to score higher on “social dominance” – measured by agreement with statements like “I certainly have self confidence” and “I am not shy with strangers”. Among women only, a bigger signature also correlated with narcissism – agreement with claims like “I am a special person” and “I am going to be a great person”. Signature size was not correlated with self esteem or aggressive dominance, which is more about controlling other people for self-serving reasons.</p>
<p>If true, these <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616301362">results</a>, published recently in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, would appear to provide some support for the quack field of graphology – the idea that our handwriting style reveals our personality (listed as one of the 50 great myths of psychology in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Myths-Popular-Psychology…">the book</a> by Scott Lilienfeld and his colleagues, based in part on <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-07238-011">a decisive meta-analysis of the area</a> published by Geoffrey Dean in 2002). But the authors of the new research are careful to argue that it is signatures specifically, not handwriting more generally, that may be revealing of personality, precisely because they are such a personal form of self expression.<span id="more-14120"></span></p>
<p>Sceptics may take some convincing, but consider that previous findings have also suggested signatures have a special psychological significance, including <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15197.full">a study</a> that showed people are more honest in a document when they sign it at the beginning rather than the end, presumably because their signature activates attention to their sense of self.</p>
<p>The new findings also add to other research linking signature styles with personality, including <a href="http://prx.sagepub.com/content/62/1/152.abstract">a paper from 1988</a> that found women who embellished their signatures with lines and exclamation points scored higher on narcissism, and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144419">another from 2014</a> that found CEOs with bigger signatures tended to receive higher salaries, but their companies performed worse. There’s even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4708124">research</a> that showed boosting people’s self-esteem, by giving them inflated feedback on an IQ test, led them to produce a larger signature.</p>
<p>Alvaro Mailhos and his colleagues say their study is an advance on the existing literature because they used three different measures of signature size – essentially based on the area of the smallest possible rectangle than can be placed around the scribble, either on a horizontal or at an angle, or based on the space filled by a curved outline drawn round the scribble.</p>
<p>They also controlled for complicating factors such as the size and number of individual characters in the person’s name, and signature style such as signing with one’s initials or a simple stylistic flourish. Importantly, they also showed that only signature size and not the size of one’s printed name was linked with social bravado and narcissism, likely because printing your name is less personal and expressive.</p>
<p>The correlations between signature size and social dominance and narcissism (in women) were modest in size (the beta coefficients in a regression were 0.12 and 014, respectively) but given they held across the different measures of size and after controlling for confounds, the researchers suggested their findings are robust and meaningful.</p>
<p>“We unambiguously demonstrate a link between personality traits and signature size, and also, in so doing, we offer a robust methodological approach to study the relationship between handwritten gestures and psychological traits that could be of value for further research,” they concluded.</p>

 Cultured pluripotent stem cells are a cornerstone of regenerative medicine owing to their ability to give rise to all cell types of the body. Although pluripotent stem cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, pluripotency is paradoxically a transient state in vivo, lasting 2–3 days around the time of blastocyst implantation. The exception to this rule is embryonic diapause, a reversible state of suspended development triggered by unfavourable conditions. Diapause is a physiological reproductive strategy widely employed across the animal kingdom, including in mammals, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that the partial inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major nutrient sensor and promoter of growth, induces reversible pausing of mouse blastocyst development and allows their prolonged culture ex vivo. Paused blastocysts remain pluripotent and competent—able to give rise to embryonic stem (ES) cells and live, fertile mice. We show that both naturally diapaused blastocysts in vivo and paused blastocysts ex vivo display pronounced reductions in mTOR activity, translation, histone modifications associated with gene activity and transcription. Pausing can be induced directly in cultured ES cells and sustained for weeks without appreciable cell death or deviations from cell cycle distributions. We show that paused ES cells display a remarkable global suppression of transcription, maintain a gene expression signature of diapaused blastocysts and remain pluripotent. These results uncover a new pluripotent stem cell state corresponding to the epiblast of the diapaused blastocyst and indicate that mTOR regulates developmental timing at the peri-implantation stage. Our findings have implications in the fields of assisted reproduction, regenerative medicine, cancer, metabolic disorders and ageing.

            <p>The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment. Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (for example, prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (for example, group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring). The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood. Here we investigate these rhythms in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parent’s incubation bout varied from 1–19 h, whereas period length—the time in which a parent’s probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value—varied from 6–43 h. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or who actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light–dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20563">doi: 10.1038/nature20563</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/yp9bhuKtU7c" width="1" />

 Current knowledge of RNA virus biodiversity is both biased and fragmentary, reflecting a focus on culturable or disease-causing agents. Here we profile the transcriptomes of over 220 invertebrate species sampled across nine animal phyla and report the discovery of 1,445 RNA viruses, including some that are sufficiently divergent to comprise new families. The identified viruses fill major gaps in the RNA virus phylogeny and reveal an evolutionary history that is characterized by both host switching and co-divergence. The invertebrate virome also reveals remarkable genomic flexibility that includes frequent recombination, lateral gene transfer among viruses and hosts, gene gain and loss, and complex genomic rearrangements. Together, these data present a view of the RNA virosphere that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in current classification schemes and provide a more solid foundation for studies in virus ecology and evolution.

 High humidity has a strong influence on the development of numerous diseases affecting the above-ground parts of plants (the phyllosphere) in crop fields and natural ecosystems, but the molecular basis of this humidity effect is not understood. Previous studies have emphasized immune suppression as a key step in bacterial pathogenesis. Here we show that humidity-dependent, pathogen-driven establishment of an aqueous intercellular space (apoplast) is another important step in bacterial infection of the phyllosphere. Bacterial effectors, such as Pseudomonas syringae HopM1, induce establishment of the aqueous apoplast and are sufficient to transform non-pathogenic P. syringae strains into virulent pathogens in immunodeficient Arabidopsis thaliana under high humidity. Arabidopsis quadruple mutants simultaneously defective in a host target (AtMIN7) of HopM1 and in pattern-triggered immunity could not only be used to reconstitute the basic features of bacterial infection, but also exhibited humidity-dependent dyshomeostasis of the endophytic commensal bacterial community in the phyllosphere. These results highlight a new conceptual framework for understanding diverse phyllosphere–bacterial interactions.

Compared to other similar systems, the wireless component is unique, allowing the monkeys to move around freely without being tethered to electronics.

<p><b>A new instrument to shed light on distant planets. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team of scientists and engineers, including TEDster Jeremy Kasdin, have used a new instrument to isolate and analyze the light emitted by planets orbiting nearby stars. The instrument, </span><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S47/82/89C62/?section=topstories" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHARIS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was designed and built by Kasdin’s team. By analyzing the light emitted by the planets, researchers are able to determine more details about their age, size and atmospheric composition. This operation was a test run, and is part of a larger scientific effort to find and analyze exoplanets.

A long time goal of researchers, previous attempts used mechanical control structures within the wing to deform it, but these structures were heavy, canceling out any fuel-efficiency gains, and they added complexity.

<p><b>A deadly Ebola mutation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">New research suggests that a mutation in the Ebola virus may be responsible for the scale of the epidemic that began in 2013 in West Africa. The research, conducted by a </span><a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31397-6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">team of researchers that included TEDster Pardis Sabeti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, showed that roughly 3 months after the initial outbreak, and about the time the epidemic was detected, the virus had mutated. The mutation made the virus better suited for humans than its natural host, the fruit bat, which may have allowed the virus to spread more aggressively. Working independently, </span><a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31396-4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another team of researchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to a similar conclusion, but the role of the mutation in Ebola’s virulence and transmissibility still needs to be clarified.

<p><b>The future of transportation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bjarke Ingels’ firm (BIG) released its design plans for a hyperloop system that would connect Dubai and Abu Dhabi in just a 12 minutes, a journey that now takes more than two hours by car.

<p><b>The world’s tallest tropical trees. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Asner has identified the </span><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/nature/worlds-tallest-tropical-trees-discovered.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world’s tallest tropical tree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using laser scanning, along with 50 other record-breakers. The tree, located in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, stands at 94.1 meters tall or, as Asner said for comparison, about the height of five sperm whales stacked snout-to-fluke. He measured the tree using a laser scanning technology called LIDAR (for Light Detection and Ranging), and since the measurement was taken remotely, they are unsure of the exact species of the tree, but think it is likely in the genus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorea</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Discoveries aside, Asner is still analyzing this new data about the forests, which he hopes to make publicly available so that policymakers can make more informed conservation plans.

<p>Experiments suggest that telling if two unfamiliar faces are the same or different is no easy task. Such research has sometimes presented participants with full body shots, has more commonly used cropped shots of people’s heads, but almost never placed the faces in a formal context, such as on a photographic ID card. But these are the situations in which face-to-photo matching is most relevant, when a shop assistant squints at a driver’s license before selling alcohol to a twitchy youth, or an emigration official scrutinises passports before their holders pass ports. Moreover, it’s plausible that the task is harder when juggling extra information, something already found in the realm of fingerprint matching, where <a href="http://https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/14/fingerprint-matching-is-biased-by-the-assessors-prejudices/">biographical information can lead to more erroneous matches</a> because it triggers observer prejudices. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new article</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> confirms these fears, suggesting that our real-world capacity to spot fakes in their natural setting is even worse than imagined.</p>
<p><span id="more-14097"></span></p>
<p>Jennifer McCaffery and Mike Burton at the University of York asked 80 adult participants to make judgments on pairs of face photographs, deciding when the two shots were of the same person or two different individuals. In some instances, one of the two faces was embedded in a passport image (see below), and in these cases the participant was also asked to keep an eye out for data errors in the passport, which were sprinkled through a minority of instances. McCaffery and Burton found that when matching against a passport-embedded photo, participants showed a bias towards thinking the two faces were of the same person, a bias which led them to miss more instances where the photos didn’t match; in a real situation, this translates to letting someone through control on another person’s passport.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_14102" style="width: 464px;"><img alt="screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35" class=" size-full wp-image-14102 aligncenter" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35.png?w=845" />Sample stimuli from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">McCaffery and Burton, 2016</a>.</figure>
<p>In another experiment, the researchers investigated how the task of face-matching affects the way we evaluate passport data and vice versa. As well as making face judgments, participants had to look out for errors in the passport, such as: the gender of the name not matching the gender of the supposed passport owner; the wrong year of birth, which could be off by 20 years (this should be an easy task, as people can typically judge age from a photograph to within five years); and an error in the place of birth, which was indicated by spelling mistakes in well-known British place names, such as “Luuton”. The participants’ error-spotting performance was compared against control participants recruited in earlier research who were challenged to look for errors without also having to perform face-matching.</p>
<p>Combining face-matching and data-matching into one situation harmed performance in both areas. Once again, faces in a passport context were more likely to be falsely waved through as a match than when the comparison was between headshots alone. And participants were poorer at spotting the data errors, compared to control participants, only catching one in five of the place of birth and year of birth errors, versus well over half caught by control participants. What’s more, participants were worse at spotting data errors when the faces were a true match, suggesting the confidence from this task leaked over to the other and made them less vigilant.</p>
<p>It’s well-known that tasks with multiple demands are harder, loading on things for our mind to deal with and allowing the possibility of interference between the two tasks. So the findings are understandable, but still troubling. Perhaps the procedure behind identity checks needs tuning by breaking it into discrete steps – perhaps even undertaken by different individuals. Moreover, this work is an important reminder that even well-established findings can be wide of the mark of how things truly operate, when based on laboratory research that doesn’t take account of real-world conditions.</p>

<li>You’re on your way to the traditional Thanksgiving family get-together. You drive down a familiar street, locate your familiar house, and park in a familiar spot.<br />
<em>Thank you, hippocampus, for dutifully encoding Wisteria Drive, the light-blue-colored Colonial house and the parking spot next to the creepy oak tree almost twenty-eight years ago. I owe you one.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Wait a minute. <em>Whose new convertible is that on our driveway?</em><br />
<em>Hippocampus, remind me to find out.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You step out of your car and notice that the neighbors still have their Halloween pumpkins on display. Ew! They look hideous.<br />
<em>Well, at least I can decipher a ‘face’ in those god-awful, shriveled carvings. Thanks, fusiform gyrus.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You quickly snap a picture, and send it to your roommate, along with, of course, the face-with-tears-of-joy emoji.<br />
<em>Thanks, again, dear fusiform gyrus, to help comprehend the world of two hundred and seventy nine emojis. You’ve revolutionized the way we text.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You stare at the magnificent spread on the dining table. But tonight, you resolve to eat in moderation. No matter how delicious the food is, as an evolved human, you have the ability to suppress an urge.<br />
<em>Thank you, prefrontal cortex, for being my sleek, determined executive controller. Your strong-willed decisions have saved my many embarrassments, especially around free food.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you open the door, you catch a whiff of blissful aroma from the kitchen. Ah! You smell pumpkin pie.<br />
<em>Wow, olfactory receptor neurons, you went from transducing smells to the olfactory bulb to making my stomach growl in no time! Thanks. Now I really have to eat.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ovoid, curvaceous gravy boat sits proudly next to the turkey, fulfilling its sole responsibility on Thanksgiving Day. You’ve always cracked up at its odd shape.<br />
<em>Hey, visual cortex, thanks to your ventral pathway for helping make sense of shapes. They sure ask “what” a lot, but I know they mean well.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your pants feel tighter as you eat, but you continue gorging the smooth, creamy mashed potatoes. <em>I can’t stop! This is so good!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations. You’ve fallen for the moves of the neural seductress, the ventral tegmental area. She has the (electrical) potential to make you feel so loved, so rewarded, and so addicted.<em> <em>Thank you, thank you, and I don’t care!</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><img alt="Thanksgiving_2" class=" wp-image-19005 aligncenter" height="252" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/Thanksgiving_2-300x196.jpg" width="386" /></em></em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex shakes his head in utter disappointment.</p>
<p>Psst! Cerebral gossip: Ever since you made a New Year’s resolution to lose weight earlier this year, the steadfast prefrontal cortex has been in a complicated relationship with the ravenous ventral tegmental area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amid the clatter of forks and plates, your aunt interrupts your intimate moment with the pumpkin pie with, “Say, when are you going to graduate and get a “real” job?”<br />
<em>Whaaa, where did this come from?</em> Your vigilant amygdala senses potential fear, and nudges the hypothalamus to sort out a fight or flight response. Your eyes widen. Your heart is beating faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let’s face it. You’re too stuffed for a fight. You’re too stuffed for a flight.</p>
<p>The amygdala makes a note: <em>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision. Do not fear unsolicited questions about career. Especially when eating dessert.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>[In reviewer voice] You missed being thankful for the brain stem.<br />
<em>Wait, really? Why should I?</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Because no one messes with the Mr. Brain Stem. We’re all just happy to have the support, and always cite him.<br />
<em>You sure have the nerve to randomly name-drop Mr. Bigwig Brain Stem.</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Yes, (cranial) nerves III – IX, to be specific.</p>
<p>Your corrected manuscript now reads: <em>I’m extremely thankful for the brain stem.</em></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It’s 10:30 PM. You try to keep your eyes open, but the idea of snuggling into your bed seems rather appealing. Oh, the sweet relief of melatonin. Yawn.<br />
<em>Thanks, suprachiasmatic nucleus. Nighty-night.</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>

            <p><em><img alt="Female head and refresh icon" class=" size-medium wp-image-14084 alignleft" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/thinkstockphotos-468413800-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>In the ongoing, complex debates about the extent and meaning of psychological differences between the sexes, mental rotation ability is usually quoted as one of the most robust examples of where a difference can be found. This is the ability to rotate objects in your mind’s eye, and while there is a lot of overlap between men’s and women’s performance, there is plenty of evidence that men, on average, are better at this than women. Can we take this to reflect a genuine, specific difference in average cognitive ability between the sexes?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. A new, small <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-015-0704-7">study</a> in <em>Psychological Research</em> reminds us why this field of science is so difficult to interpret. The findings suggest that the mental rotation ability of women who habitually suppress the public display of their emotions is equal to that of men. In other words, sex differences in mental rotation ability may reflect an emotional difference between the sexes – emotional suppression is known to be more common in men than women – rather than a cognitive difference.<span id="more-14012"></span></p>
<p>Anne-Katharina Faltung and Markus Kiefer asked 28 men and 28 women to fill out some surveys about their emotional lives, including their proneness to angry outbursts and their tendency to suppress public displays of emotion (one example item was “I keep my emotions to myself”).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_14091" style="width: 167px;"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19" class=" size-medium wp-image-14091 alignright" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19.png?w=157&amp;h=300" width="157" /><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701">Shepard &amp; Meltzer, 1971</a>.</figure>
<p>Then the participants completed 48 trials of a classic mental rotation task, which involved judging within four-seconds per trial whether or not a three-dimensional shape on the left of the computer screen was the same as the one on the right, just rotated to a different orientation. The trials got harder as the task went on, and emoji-type symbols and spoken feedback (such as “Oh dear, you made a mistake”) informed the participants whether they’d got each trial right or not.</p>
<p>Overall, the men outperformed the women in terms of making fewer total errors, and in being less likely to follow up one error with another. The researchers were particularly interested in these follow-on errors because they are a sign of the participant reacting badly to negative feedback, either through being distracted or giving up.</p>
<p>But then Faltung and Kiefer split up their male and female groups according to emotional suppression habits. Overall men reported suppressing their emotions more than women, but there was enough variation among the women to create two subgroups – one group who said they mostly let their emotions out, and another group who said they more often suppressed their emotions.</p>
<p>Women who did not habitually suppress their emotions made more total errors on the task than men (both high and low emotional suppressors) and more follow-on errors, but crucially, women who habitually suppressed their emotions performed as well as the men on the rotation task, in terms of total errors and follow-on errors (there was still a tendency for higher performance among men, but the difference in their scores and those of the emotion-suppressing women was not statistically significant).</p>
<p>We must beware over-interpreting such as small study, but the researchers say their results demonstrate an important principle, namely that investigations into potential cognitive differences between the sexes need to take sex differences in emotional strategy into account. Mental rotation ability – often heralded as one of the most robust examples of a sex-linked cognitive difference – may be more about emotions than about visuospatial ability.</p>
<p>This need for nuance in the field of sex-differences research is in addition to other findings that have highlighted the way that cultural pressures can influence sex differences in cognitive performance. For example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/01/womens-true-maths-skills-unlocked-by-pretending-to-be-someone-else/">it’s been shown</a> that women perform as well as men on maths when competing under an alias, presumably because this removes the pressure not to conform to sex-related prejudices about ability.</p>
<p>Another angle to these new findings concerns emotional regulation strategies. It’s a mistake to think that the male tendency for emotional suppression is inherently superior.  In fact emotional suppression is usually considered unhelpful, especially over the longer term, because it’s linked with increased risk of stress and depression. But these findings suggest that in the short term, and in certain contexts, it may be advantageous by helping to avoid the distracting effect of negative feedback.</p>
