<p>This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper "Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/03/25/building-neuromatch-academy/">Building Neuromatch Academy</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content">Neuromatch Academy 2020</a> is a three-week online summer school in computational neuroscience that took place in July of 2020. We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience – from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. </p>



<p>By now, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973">we have a preprint out</a>, and NMA has been covered in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">the Lancet</a>. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I’m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. <a href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/">Richard Gao wrote a great post</a> on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.</p>



<h2>A little background: my stint into teaching</h2>



<p>After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here’s my explanation of globals in Python:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type… If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it’s a module variable. That’s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. […many rambling minutes later…]. In any case, don’t use globals if you can avoid them.</p></blockquote>



<p>Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn’t fit with novice students’ current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner’s motivations – both intrinsic and extrinsic – and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically – at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!</p>



<p>In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/">Code in Place</a>. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford – <a href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html">including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel</a> – given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level – understanding what they’re stuck on, where they’re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.</p>

<p>A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording’s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team – Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  – working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn’t know I was ready for. So <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">if you’re wondering whether industry is right for you</a>, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it’s a great place to get that experience.</p>



<h2>Deciding what to build</h2>



<p>When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you’re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">Heilmeier questions</a>:</p>



<ul><li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li><li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li><li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</li><li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li><li>What are the risks?</li><li>How much will it cost?</li><li>How long will it take?</li><li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li></ul>



<p>If you can answer these questions, you know what you’re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn’t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:</p>



<ul><li>We’re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.</li><li>Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don’t foster belonging. </li><li>We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.</li><li>We’ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.</li><li>Execution risk and legal risk</li><li>1500$ for each TA, and we’re aiming for 200 TAs</li><li>We’re launching July 13th</li><li>We’ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.</li></ul>



<p>Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier’s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee’s duties. The curriculum committee’s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.</p>



<h2>Running on enthusiasm</h2>



<p>I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We’re democratizing education! We’re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We’re doing something no one’s ever done! </p>



<p>I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer’s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer’s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you’re refusing to accept that gift, and that’s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step – you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! </p>



<p>For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There’s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done – update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in – we used <a href="http://quire.io/">quire</a>, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It’s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.</p>



<p>If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.</p>



<h2>Running like clockwork</h2>



<p>Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen – when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.</p>

<p>For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. <a href="https://twitter.com/emdupre">Elizabeth DuPre</a> pointed me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference">this talk by the creator of Elm</a> – in open source projects, the right culture doesn’t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. “Deadlines matter” is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you’re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can’t do that at NMA – your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. – if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. </p>



<p>If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran – ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me “a little German” for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I’m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/">It’s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism</a> – we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that’s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn’t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a “good enough” version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. </p>



<h2>You need good tools to work productively with each other</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, Fred Brooks claims that “adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later”. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle – a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it’s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.</p>



<p>So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.</p>



<p>Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (<a href="https://www.wevideo.com/">WeVideo</a>) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.</p>



<h2>You need good organization to work productively with each</h2>



<p>The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don’t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn’t enough.</p>



<p>The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student’s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That’s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It’s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel – everybody is on the same side. It’s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/">This kind of design thinking</a> – ship early, ship often, iterate – can be applied to all aspects of open source education.</p>



<p>The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.</p>



<p>Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:</p>

<h2>Be the change you wish to see</h2>



<p>My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s law</a> – but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students’ intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That’s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students’ emotional needs. That’s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.</p>



<p>Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads – I can be a difficult person and that’s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant’s email signature):</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabbit-handstand-front-paws-gene-defect-video">A gene defect may make rabbits do handstands instead of hop</a></h4>

<p>One defective gene might turn some bunnies’ hops into handstands, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>To move quickly, a breed of domesticated rabbit called sauteur d’Alfort sends its back legs sky high and walks on its front paws. That strange gait may be the result of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009429">a gene tied to limb movement</a>, researchers report March 25 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>



<p>Sauteur d’Alfort rabbits aren’t the only animal to adopt an odd scamper if there’s a mutation to this gene, known as <em>RORB</em>. Mice with a mutation to the gene also do handstands if they start to run, says Stephanie Koch, a neuroscientist at University College London who was not involved with the rabbit work. And even while walking, the mice <a href="https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.11.011/attachment/7e3ba9eb-311d-458a-933f-fb03f6f5bfd5/mmc3.mp4">hike their back legs up to waddle forward</a>, almost like a duck.</p>



<p>“I spent four years looking at these mice doing little handstands, and now I get to see a rabbit do the same handstand,” says Koch, who led a 2017 study published in <em>Neuron</em> that explored <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)31064-4">the mechanism behind the “duck gait” in mice</a>. “It’s amazing.”</p>





<p>Understanding why the rabbits move in such a strange way could help researchers learn more about how the spinal cord works. The study is “contributing to our basic knowledge about a very important function in humans and all animals — how we are able to move,” says Leif Andersson, a molecular geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden.</p>



<p>In the rabbit study, Andersson and colleagues bred hop-less sauteur d’Alfort male rabbits with New Zealand white female rabbits that can hop. The team then scanned the genetic blueprints of the offspring that couldn’t hop and looked for mutations that didn’t appear in offspring that could.</p>



<p>A mutation in the <em>RORB</em> gene popped up as a likely candidate for the rabbits’ acrobatic handstands. That change creates faulty versions of the genetic instructions that cells use to make proteins, the researchers found. As a result, there appears to be less of the RORB protein in specialized nerve cells in rabbits that have the mutation compared with rabbits that don’t.</p>



<p>Those spinal cord nerve cells, called interneurons, help coordinate the left and right side of the body and are crucial for a normal gait, Anderson says. Without the RORB protein in interneurons, the rabbits may lack the ability to coordinate what their hind limbs are doing, which restricts their ability to hop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Sauteur d’Alfort rabbits do handstands to move faster or cover long distances.</figure>



<p>While moving slowly from place to place, rabbits with the defective gene can walk normally, alternating their front and hind legs. But rabbits hop to move fast or to travel over long distances. And hopping requires synchronized hind legs to jump at the same time, says study coauthor Miguel Carneiro, a molecular geneticist at Universidade do Porto in Vairão, Portugal. </p>



<p>Without that coordination, some hop-less bunnies might do a more drastic handstand than others. But all rabbits with a <em>RORB</em> mutation use their front paws to move quickly, Carneiro says.</p>



<p>It’s an interesting observation, although the study doesn’t reveal much about how the lack of the RORB protein in interneurons spurs the rabbits’ handstands, Koch says. “All they’re looking for is that mutation in one gene and how that gene is affecting the spinal cord, but it could be affecting everything in the rabbit. We have no idea.”  </p>



<p>Uncovering how that genetic defect affects the body more broadly could be important for understanding the way all animals move. Even people can’t run without harmonized movements of our four limbs. “If you look at the 100-meter sprint — Usain Bolt or someone like that — there’s super coordination between limbs,” Andersson says. “If you lack the coordination between arms and legs… you could never compete for a gold medal.”</p>



<p>These handstand rabbits wouldn’t grab any golds either. But they could help researchers develop ways to repair the body when defects in <em>RORB</em> cause disease, Koch says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-data-update-efficacy">AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine holds up in an updated analysis of trial data</a></h4>

<p>Analysis of the latest data from a clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford shows the shot is still effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms, the pharmaceutical company reported March 25.</p>



<p>The news comes after the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases aired concerns that AstraZeneca <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective-us-trial-results">may have included outdated information </a>in an interim analysis of the trial (<em>SN: 2/22/21</em>). That interim analysis, announced on March 22, found the vaccine was 79 percent effective. The efficacy was based on 141 cases of COVID-19 among the trial’s 32,449 participants, but the cases were recorded only through February 17.</p>

<p>Since that date, more people in the trial tested positive for the coronavirus. The latest analysis <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html">included an additional 49 cases</a>, bringing the total to 190, AstraZeneca said in a March 25 statement. Taking the new data into account, the vaccine now has an efficacy of 76 percent — only three percentage points lower than in the interim report. There are an additional 14 possible COVID-19 cases in the trial that researchers still need to confirm, AstraZeneca said in its statement. The company has not specified how many cases were in people who got the vaccine or in those who got a placebo.</p>





<p>The slight decrease in efficacy <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-press-release-from-astrazeneca-announcing-primary-data-on-safety-and-efficacy-from-the-us-trial-of-the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/">is not unexpected</a>, Stephen Evans, a vaccine expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said in a statement released by the Science Media Centre. As more participants in the trial catch the coronavirus and develop symptoms, overall efficacy can fluctuate.</p>



<p>In fact, the vaccine’s efficacy for trial participants aged 65 and older actually got better with the new analysis. While the interim analysis reported an efficacy of 80 percent in that age group, the more recent results push it higher to 85 percent.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the results from both analyses are statistically different from one another. It’s possible that the reported efficacies in the groups fall within a similar margin of error, so the differences may mean little in the real world.</p>

<p>The shot is also still highly effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization, AstraZeneca reports. So far, eight people in the trial have fallen severely ill, all of whom received the placebo.</p>



<p>The rapid analysis redo is the latest stumble in AstraZeneca’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">efforts to roll out</a> and build confidence in its vaccine (<em>SN: 11/23/20</em>). But even amid the missteps to pinpoint the efficacy of its vaccine, AstraZeneca’s results still meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s requirements for emergency use authorization. Authorized vaccines must reduce COVID-19 cases by half in vaccinated people compared with unvaccinated people. The FDA will conduct its own scrutiny of the trial data when AstraZeneca applies for emergency use in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Octopuses cycle through two stages of slumber, a new study reports.</p>



<p>First comes quiet sleep, and then a shift to a twitchy, active sleep in which vibrant colors flash across the animals’ skin. These details, gleaned from four snoozing cephalopods in a lab in a Brazil, may provide clues to a big scientific mystery: Why do animals sleep?</p>



<p>Sleep is so important that every animal seems to have a version of it, says Philippe Mourrain, a neurobiologist at Stanford University who recently described <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/both-fish-and-humans-have-rem-sleep">the sleep stages of fish</a> (<em>SN: 7/10/19</em>). Scientists have also catalogued sleep in reptiles, birds, amphibians, bees, mammals and jellyfish, to name a few. “So far, we have not found a single species that does not sleep,” says Mourrain, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Cephalopod neuroscientist and diver Sylvia Medeiros caught four wild octopuses, <em>Octopus insularis</em>, and brought them temporarily into a lab at the Brain Institute of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in Natal, Brazil. After tucking the animals away in a quiet area, she began to carefully record their behavior during the day, when octopuses are more likely to rest.</p>





<p>Two <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102223">distinct states emerged</a>, she and her colleagues report March 25 in <em>iScience</em>. In the first, called quiet sleep, the octopuses are pale and motionless with the pupils of their eyes narrowed to slits. Active sleep comes next. Eyes dart around, suckers contract, muscles twitch, skin textures change and, most dramatically, bright colors race across octopuses’ bodies. This wild sleep is rhythmic, happening every half an hour or so, and brief; it’s over after about 40 seconds. Active sleep is also rare; the octopuses spent less than 1 percent of their days in active sleep, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Active sleep in octopuses is somewhat like REM sleep in people, Medeiros says. But because octopuses’ active sleep is so short, their sleep cycles more closely resemble the sleep of reptiles and birds, says study coauthor Sidarta Ribeiro, a neuroscientist also at the Brain Institute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>In the midst of an active sleep state, an octopus’s skin changes color and texture. Moving eyes, twitching muscles and squeezing suckers also mark this REM-like phase.</figure>



<p>The results are consistent with recent work on sleeping cuttlefish, another cephalopod, says neuroethologist Teresa Iglesias of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. “I’m thrilled by the progress and interest in cephalopod sleep research,” she says.</p>



<p>In people, sleep is thought to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-rem-sleep-help-store-memories">allow the brain to organize itself</a>, getting rid of useless information and strengthening helpful memories (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). “It comes to mind immediately that the octopus is very smart,” Ribeiro says. Perhaps a similar sorting process happens in the sleeping octopus brain, he says.</p>



<p>For people, REM sleep is packed with dreams. “It is tempting to try to read octopuses’ dreams on their skin,” Ribeiro says. But as fun as it is to speculate, no one knows what the octopuses experience during these active sessions of vibrant, flickering color. Researchers have a lot more work to do before they can say that octopuses dream, Ribeiro says. And even if it turns out that they do, those dreams might not make much sense to a human. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whitefly-plant-gene-transfer-pest-biology-chemical-toxin">A plant gene may have helped whiteflies become a major pest</a></h4>

<p>At some point between 35 million and 80 million years ago, a whitefly landed on a leaf and started sucking its sweet sap. That fateful meal provided more than sugar. Somehow, a gene from the plant wound its way into the whitefly’s genome, a new study suggests, and may have helped its ancestors become one of the most notorious agricultural pests today.</p>



<p>The gene helps plants neutralize and safely store certain toxic molecules they use to deter herbivores. In whiteflies (<em>Bemisia tabaci</em>), it allows the insects to feed on flora, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00164-1">undeterred by one of the plant world’s best chemical weapons</a>, researchers report March 25 in <em>Cell</em>. This plant-to-insect gene swap is the second ever documented, and the clearest example of an insect effectively commandeering the genetic toolkit of their “prey” to use it against them.</p>



<p>“Ten or 20 years ago no one thought that this kind of gene transfer was possible,” says Roy Kirsch, a chemical ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study. “There are so many barriers a gene must overcome to move from a plant to an insect, but this study clearly shows that it happened, and that the gene provides a benefit to whiteflies.”</p>



<p>Gene swapping is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nearness-key-microbe-dna-swaps">common among bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/11</em>), and occasionally happens between gut microbes and their animal hosts. Known as horizontal gene transfer, this process allows organisms to bypass the plodding nature of parent-to-offspring inheritance and instantly acquire genes shaped by generations of natural selection. But a genetic jump from plants to insects, lineages separated by at least a billion years of evolution, has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72267-1.pdf">been documented only once before</a>, also in whiteflies.</p>





<p>Whiteflies are aphidlike insects that feed on over 600 different plants around the globe. The pernicious pests’ wide-ranging diet stems in part from their ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/major-crop-pest-can-make-tomato-plants-lie-their-neighbors">evade many common plant defenses</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/19</em>). While looking for genes that underlie this ability, researchers in China stumbled upon something strange in three closely related whitefly species — a gene, called <em>BtPMaT1</em>, not known to exist outside of plants.</p>



<p>Two scenarios could explain such a pattern. Either the gene arose in the common ancestor of plants and insects and was subsequently snuffed out on all intervening branches of the tree of life, or whiteflies somehow acquired the gene from plants. Because plants and insects are so distantly related, the latter scenario is “much, much more likely,” says Kirsch. These three whitefly species split some 35 million years ago, suggesting they got the gene before then. But close relatives that diverged 80 million years ago lack the gene, suggesting the transfer happened within that window.</p>



<p>The gene allows plants to stow a common class of defensive chemicals called phenolic glycosides by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04298.x">neutralizing the toxins</a> until herbivores start munching. “Phenolic glycosides are very toxic to insects,” says study coauthor Ted Turlings, a chemical ecologist and entomologist at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The possibility that whiteflies might use a plant detoxification gene to tolerate plant toxins tantalized Turlings’ colleagues in China.</p>



<p>The researchers inserted a bit of RNA into tomato plants in the lab. Once ingested by whiteflies, the RNA was designed to disable their <em>BtPMaT1</em> gene. Then, the team let whiteflies loose. After a week of feeding on five genetically altered plants, all of the approximately 2,500 whiteflies were dead, compared with only about 20 percent of those that fed on unaltered plants. Such a drastic effect suggests this gene plays an important role in helping whiteflies bypass plant defenses, Turlings says. </p>



<p>How exactly a plant <em>BtPMaT1 </em>wound up in whiteflies remains a mystery. Viruses can accidentally shuttle bits of DNA between hosts, and Turlings suspects this likely happened here. “This is an extremely rare event, but when you’re talking about billions of insects and plants interacting over millions of years, it becomes more possible,” he says. Horizontal gene transfer might possibly be “an important mechanism for pests to gain abilities to deal with plant defenses.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72267-1.pdf">first documented plant-to-insect gene swap</a>, reported September 23 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, also occurred in whiteflies, though the function of the gene in that swap is less clear. It may not be a coincidence, though, that the two known examples of such an event occurred in the same herbivorous insect.</p>



<p>“The lives of whiteflies and their plant hosts are closely intertwined,” says Shannon Soucy, an evolutionary microbiologist at Dartmouth College who wasn’t involved in the research. That consistent exposure primes the system to be ready for this kind of event, she says, which ultimately allowed whiteflies to use this plant defense gene against its maker.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Drinking culture is a huge part of university, with Freshers’ Week events often revolving near-exclusively around getting drunk. A <a href="https://www.nus.org.uk/articles/new-survey-shows-trends-in-student-drinking">2018 survey</a> from the National Union of Students found that 76% of respondents feel an expectation for students to “drink to get drunk”; 79% agreed that “drinking and getting drunk” is a key part of university culture.</p>



<p>This isn’t for everyone, however: a quick search of student forums will show many young people, pre-university, anxious about a drinking culture they don’t want to participate in. Now a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12511">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Health Psychology</em>, authored by Dominic Conroy from the University of East London and team, has taken a closer look at students’ decisions to reduce their alcohol consumption — and what prevents them from doing so.</p>



<span id="more-41657"></span>



<p>Participants were ten undergraduate students from the UK, all of whom had undergone a transition in their drinking habits, decreasing or stopping altogether. The students had different levels and patterns of drinking: some were light drinkers or completely teetotal, while others were more moderate drinkers.</p>



<p>The students took part in semi-structured interviews with one of the paper’s authors, responding to open-ended questions related to their drinking. Two “dilemmas” emerged from the participants’ responses: wanting to drink less but being concerned about social ramifications, and wanting to cut down but worrying about social confidence and missing out on fun.</p>



<p>Resolving the first dilemma — wanting to cut down but being concerned about social ramifications — was considered “important yet difficult to achieve” for participants: not drinking often came with an in-built assumption that the person was “uninterested in socialising” altogether. One participant described involving himself in drinking games during Freshers’ Week purely to build social connections: “I think it would have been more difficult to make friends if I was avoiding drinking completely,” he said.</p>



<p>For multiple participants, there was a desire to recognise the connections between early-term socialising and the potential for friendship in the years ahead; drinking during the early stages of university was often part of that process. This balancing act wasn’t always easy: one participant, Kelly, said that being open about her drinking preferences led to people “making [her] feel weird” and that her relationship with her flatmates was “quite difficult” because of it.</p>



<p>The second dilemma  —  missing out on fun and social confidence brought on by alcohol  —  was also resonant in participants’ accounts of university life. Alice told the team that “as a sober person, I’m so much more in control… sometimes I think I would enjoy myself more if I was pissed and less inhibited”, pinpointing alcohol as a source of fun, good memories, and uninhibitedness.</p>



<p>Other participants, more moderate drinkers who had cut down, experienced a similar yearning for the fun of alcohol  — but faced a further dilemma of trying to drink less than they had before or simply getting drunk as usual. Here, students felt trapped in a binary of either drinking a lot or drinking nothing.</p>



<p>The study had a small sample size and was not quantitative, so it’s hard to get an idea of how <em>many</em> students might be feeling this way or are being forced to compromise for the sake of their social lives. However, the insights from the conversations suggest a more complex picture of drinking at university than is sometimes understood.</p>



<p>There is a clear (and perhaps unsurprising) thread running through the findings that peer pressure or social norms are pushing students into drinking, or drinking more than one wants or intends to. One notable testimony suggested that there is little give-and-take on the part of students who <em>do</em> drink, with those who drink very little being forced to compromise instead. Those who don’t drink also miss out on social connections and fear they are missing out on fun.</p>



<p>Paying attention to these two broad dilemmas, and the individual issues they encapsulate, may be a way of understanding the issues students face when it comes to drinking, drug-taking and peer pressure during university. The team notes that the students interviewed often (perhaps inadvertently) demonstrated a “sober curious” attitude to drinking, an approach that has taken off in the media over the last few years. Promoting such an approach, which rejects strict dichotomies, may be one way of helping students manage their drinking in a way that feels right for them, shifting norms around alcohol at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Organics on Mars</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/organic-production-mars"><em>Science News</em></a>, March 27, 1971</p>



<p>[Researchers] have exposed a mixture of gases simulating conditions believed to exist on the surface of Mars to ultraviolet radiation. The reaction produced organic compounds. They conclude that the ultraviolet radiation bombarding the surface of Mars could be producing organic matter on that planet.… The fact that such organic compounds may be produced on the Martian surface increases the possibility of life on Mars.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p> In 1976, a few years after those experiments, NASA took its search for organic molecules to the Red Planet’s surface. That year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/40-years-ago-viking-1-pioneered-us-exploration-mars">the Viking landers</a> became the first U.S. mission to land on Mars. Though the landers failed to turn up evidence in the soil, NASA has continued the hunt. In 2018, the Curiosity rover found hints of life: organic molecules in rocks and seasonal shifts in atmospheric methane. A new phase of the hunt began in February <a data-id="3096458" data-type="post" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">when the Perseverance rover landed on Mars</a> (<em>SN Online: 2/17/21</em>).

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-sheep-skin-legal-papers-fraud-prevention-parchment">How using sheepskin for legal papers may have prevented fraud</a></h4>

<p>Fraudulent efforts to tweak legal documents in Great Britain may have been thwarted by the very parchment those documents were written on, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that property deeds were written on a range of animal skins, such as goat, calf and sheep. But it turns out <a href="https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-021-00503-6">sheepskin was the parchment of choice</a>, researchers report March 24 in <em>Heritage Science</em>.  An analysis of proteins extracted from 645 samples from 477 British legal documents dating from the 16th to the 20th century shows that 622, or 96.4 percent, were made of sheepskin.</p>



<p>That popularity may be tied to low cost compared with other parchments, like vellum made from calfskin, as well as sheepskin’s fraud-busting powers.</p>



<p>To make parchment out of animal skin, the skins are submerged in lime, a white powdery caustic soda, which removes the fat. Sheepskin has more fat — accounting for 30 to 50 percent of its weight — than other animal skins. (Cattle skin, for instance, is 2 to 3 percent fat.) So its removal leaves bigger gaps between the skin’s other layers. Scraping ink from this parchment can detach these loose layers, marring the surface and revealing changes to it.</p>



<p> “We know so little about these documents, despite the fact that there are millions worldwide,” says study coauthor Sean Doherty, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in England. Studies like these, Doherty says, “are transforming libraries into biomolecular archives,” which are allowing researchers to better understand animals, craft and trade over the past millennia.</p>



<p>Several 12th and 17th century documents describe sheepskin as useful in detecting changes to an original document, such as tampering with a property owner’s name. The new study adds to evidence that sheepskin helped to prevent fraudsters from pulling the wool over English officials’ eyes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-new-measurement-time-redefining-second">Atomic clocks take a step toward redefining the second</a></h4>

<p>A new measurement moves scientists closer to revamping how we keep time.</p>



<p>After scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilogram-just-got-revamp-unit-time-might-be-next">redefined the unit of mass</a>, the kilogram, in 2019, they set their sights on overhauling the fundamental unit of time, the second (<em>SN: 5/20/19</em>). Now, comparisons between three atomic clocks mark an important step toward that goal.</p>



<p>Since the 1960s, the second has been defined by atomic clocks made of cesium atoms, which absorb and emit light at a particular frequency that determines the length of a second. But “there have been a lot of improvements in atomic clocks since then,” says physicist David Hume of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo. Improved timepieces called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-timekeeping">optical atomic clocks</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/14</em>) could be used to more precisely define the second.</p>



<p>But first, scientists must ensure they fully understand the new clocks, for example by comparing the frequencies of light from different timepieces. Now, scientists with the Boulder Atomic Clock Optical Network, or BACON, have made such comparisons, measuring the ratios of frequencies of three atomic clocks, one made of ytterbium atoms, one of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-atomic-clock-most-precise-yet">strontium</a> atoms and one made with a single electrically charged aluminum atom (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>). The results are <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03253-4">the most precise clock comparisons yet</a>, with uncertainties less than a quadrillionth of a percent, the researchers report in the March 25 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Because the three clocks were in different locations — two at NIST and the other 1.5 kilometers away at the research institute JILA — the team compared the clocks by sending information across an optical fiber and through an open-air link. This ability to compare distant optical atomic clocks is a step toward clock networks that could be used to make precise measurements such as characterizing Earth’s gravity and testing fundamental physics.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">A new black hole image reveals the behemoth’s magnetic fields</a></h4>

<p>Astronomers have gotten their first glimpse of the magnetic fields tangled around a black hole.</p>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope has unveiled <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/abe4de">the magnetism of the hot, glowing gas</a> around the supermassive black hole at the heart of galaxy M87, researchers report in two studies published online March 24 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. These magnetic fields are thought to play a crucial role in how the black hole scarfs down matter and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-first-image-black-hole-questions">launches powerful plasma jets</a> thousands of light-years into space (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve known for decades that jets are in some sense powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes, and that the in-spiraling gas and the outflowing plasma are highly magnetized — but there was a lot of uncertainty in the exact details,” says Eileen Meyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County not involved in the work. “The magnetic field structure of the plasma near the event horizon [of a black hole] is a completely new piece of information.”</p>



<p>The supermassive black hole inside M87 was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first black hole to get its picture taken</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That image showed the black hole’s shadow against its accretion disk — the bright eddy of superhot gas spiraling around the black hole’s dark center. It was created using observations taken in April 2017 by a global network of observatories, which collectively <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">form one virtual, Earth-sized radio dish</a> called the Event Horizon Telescope (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Using data from 2017, scientists created the first real picture of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87. How? We explain.</figure>



<p>The new analysis uses the same observations. But unlike the black hole’s initial portrait, the new image accounts for the polarization of the light waves emitted by gas around the black hole. Polarization measures a light wave’s orientation — whether it wiggles up and down, left and right or at an angle — and can be affected by the magnetic field where the light originated. So, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/abe71d">mapping the polarization of light</a> around the edge of M87’s black hole, researchers were able to trace the structure of the underlying magnetic fields.</p>





<p>The team found evidence that some magnetic fields loop around the black hole along with the disk of material swirling into it. That’s to be expected because “when gas is rotating, it’s basically able to carry along the magnetic field with it,” says Jason Dexter, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>But, he says, “there’s some interesting component of this magnetic field which is not just following the motion of the gas.” At least some of the magnetic field lines are sticking up or down perpendicularly from the accretion disk, or pointing directly toward or away from the black hole, Dexter and colleagues found. These magnetic fields must be very strong to resist being dragged around by the whirl of infalling gas, he says.</p>



<p>Such strong magnetic fields may actually push back against some of the material spiraling in toward the black hole, helping it resist gravity’s pull, says study coauthor Monika Mościbrodzka, an astrophysicist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Magnetic fields pointed up and down from the accretion disk could also help launch the black hole’s plasma jets, by channeling material toward the black hole’s poles and giving it a boost in speed, she says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do you know whether to trust what someone is telling you? There’s ongoing debate about which cues are reliable, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/10/20/decades-of-lie-detection-research-has-been-unrealistic/">how good we are at recognising deception</a>. But now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20649-4">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> reveals that we reliably take a particular pattern of speech pitch, loudness and duration as indicating either that the person lying or that they’re unsure of what they’re saying — and that we do it without even being aware of what we’re tuning into.</p>



<span id="more-41646"></span>



<p>In an initial study, Louise Goupil at Sorbonne University, France, and her team manipulated the pitch, loudness and duration of a series of spoken pseudo-words (which sounded like they could be real words in French, but were not). Twenty native French speakers then listened to these words and rated the speaker’s honesty and also their certainty (honesty and certainty were investigated in two separate trials with the same participants, held one week apart). The participants were also asked how confident they were in their judgements.</p>



<p>The team’s analysis revealed that a single “prosodic signature” — that is, the same pattern of volume, pitch, and speed — was associated with perceptions of both honesty and certainty. Loudness (especially at the beginning of the word), a lower pitch towards the end of the word, a less variable pitch overall, and a faster pace of speaking were all associated with more honesty/confidence. The opposite patterns were associated with less of either. The team also found that the participants were more confident when making judgements about the speaker’s certainty.</p>



<p>Of course, uncertainty and deception are not the same thing. A subsequent study involving two groups of 20 participants revealed that context — in this case, background information about what the speakers were purportedly doing when they uttered the pseudo-words — allows us to use the same vocal signature to make judgements about either honesty or confidence, depending on the situation. However, while there was widespread agreement when it came to judging confidence, the group was more split when judging honesty. While the data showed that the prosodic signature informed all their judgements, some of the participants decided that the speaker was faking an honest voice. This suggests that we rely heavily on sensory evidence in inferring a speaker’s level of confidence, but our judgements about whether they’re being truthful or not are more complex.</p>



<p>Further questioning of this same group of participants revealed that though they did indeed rely on the three-factor prosodic signature in making their judgements, they were to a large extent unaware of just what they were tuning into. The team also studied additional participants whose native languages included English, Spanish, German, Marathi, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese — and found the same results. “Overall, these results demonstrate the language independence of a core prosodic signature that underlies both judgements of certainty and honesty,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The researchers suggest that the prosodic signature is tied to signs of cognitive effort: someone who has to make more of an effort with what they’re saying — either because they aren’t very sure or because they’re lying — will take longer to say it, for example, and use less emphasis. That could explain why it is apparently not culture-dependent, but fundamental to all people.</p>



<p>A follow-up study by the team did reveal that when participants heard words spoken with the prosodic signature of unreliability/dishonesty, these words “popped out” against effortless speech, grabbing the participants’ attention. So perhaps, starting in young childhood, we learn to spot these signs of cognitive effort, and learn to interpret them as indicating uncertainty or dishonesty. Alternatively, it might be part of a more ancient, innate system, shaped through evolutionary pressures to know whom to trust.</p>



<p>The team also found some gender differences in explicit judgements about whether people were lying/uncertain. For example, women were more likely to interpret certain/honest signatures as being faked. However, the data can’t reveal whether these differences were down to gender per se, or other related factors, such as anxiety or empathy.</p>



<p>Clearly, there are questions still to be answered. But it’s fascinating and, as the researchers write: “Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that, contrary to decades of research arguing that humans are highly gullible, dedicated mechanisms actually allow us to detect unreliability in our social partners effectively.”</p>



<p>There are some immediate practical implications, too. We evolved, of course, to interact face to face — and we can only use this prosodic signature when someone is talking to us, not if they are giving us information via a keyboard and screen. Whatever the benefits of this increasingly common way of interacting, the silencing of this particular method for spotting liars and hustlers is clearly a cost.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-mystery-deepens-demise-reported-detection">The dark matter mystery deepens with the demise of a reported detection</a></h4>

<p><em>First of two parts</em></p>



<p>In mystery stories, the chief suspect almost always gets exonerated before the end of the book. Typically because a key piece of evidence turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p>In science, key evidence is supposed to be right. But sometimes it’s not. In the mystery of the invisible “dark matter” in space, evidence implicating one chief suspect has now been directly debunked. WIMPs, tiny particles widely regarded as prime dark matter candidates, have failed to appear in an experiment designed specifically to test the lone previous study claiming to detect them.</p>



<p>For decades, physicists have realized that most of the universe’s matter is nothing like earthly matter, which is made mostly from protons and neutrons. Gravitational influences on visible matter (stars and galaxies) indicate that some dark stuff of unknown identity pervades the cosmos. Ordinary matter accounts for less than 20 percent of the cosmic matter abundance.</p>





<p>For unrelated reasons, theorists have also long suggested that nature possesses mysterious types of tiny particles predicted by a theoretical mathematical framework known as supersymmetry, or SUSY for short. Those particles would be massive by subatomic standards but would interact only weakly with other matter, and so are known as Weakly Interacting Massive particles, hence WIMPs.</p>



<p>Of the many possible species of WIMPs, one (presumably the lightest one) should have the properties necessary to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-dark">explain the dark matter messing with the motion of stars and galaxies</a> (<em>SN: 12/27/12</em>). Way back in the last century, searches began for WIMPs in an effort to demonstrate their existence and identify which species made up the dark matter.</p>



<p>In 1998, one research team announced apparent success. An <a href="http://people.roma2.infn.it/~dama/web/home.html">experiment called DAMA</a> (for DArk MAtter, get it?), consisting of a particle detector buried under the Italian Alps, seemingly did detect particles with properties matching some physicists’ expectations for a dark matter signal.</p>



<p>It was a tricky experiment to perform, relying on the premise that space is full of swarms of WIMPs. A detector containing chunks of sodium iodide should give off a flash of light when hit by a WIMP. But other particles from natural radioactive substances would also produce flashes of light even if WIMPs are a myth.</p>



<p>So the experimenters adopted a clever suggestion proposed earlier by physicists Katherine Freese, David Spergel and Andrzej Drukier, known formally as an annual modulation test. But let’s just call it the June-December approach.</p>



<p>As the Earth orbits the sun, the sun also moves, traveling around the Milky Way galaxy, carried by a spiral arm in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. If the galaxy really is full of WIMPs, the sun should be constantly plowing through them, generating a “WIMP wind.” (It’s like the wind you feel if you stick your head out of the window of a moving car.) In June, the Earth’s orbit moves it in the same direction as the sun’s motion around the galaxy — into the wind. But in December, the Earth moves the opposite direction, away from the wind. So more WIMPs should be striking the Earth in June than in December. It’s just like the way your car windshield smashes into more raindrops when driving forward than when going in reverse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="diagram of WIMP wind during Earth's revolution" class="wp-image-3097711" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032321_to_column-darkmatter_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097711">As the sun moves through space, it should collide with dark matter particles called WIMPs, if they exist. When the Earth’s revolution carries it in the same direction as the sun, in summer, the resulting “WIMP wind” should appear stronger, with more WIMP collisions detected in June than in December.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097711"><p class="xxxmsonormal">GEOATLAS/GRAPHI-OGRE, ADAPTED BY T. DUBÉ</p></span></figure>



<p>At an astrophysics conference in Paris in December 1998, Pierluigi Belli of the DAMA team reported a clear signal (or at least a strong hint) that more particles arrived in June than December. (More precisely, the results showed an annual modulation in frequency of light flashes, peaking around June with a minimum in December.) The DAMA data indicated a WIMP weighing in at 59 billion electron volts, roughly 60 times the mass of a proton.</p>



<p>But some experts had concerns about the DAMA team’s data analysis. And other searches for WIMPs, with different detectors and strategies, should have found WIMPs if DAMA was right — but didn’t. Still, DAMA persisted. An advanced version of the experiment, DAMA/LIBRA, continued to find the June-December disparity.</p>



<p>Perhaps DAMA was more sensitive to WIMPs than other experiments. After all, the other searches did not duplicate DAMA’s methods. Some used substances other than sodium iodide as a detecting material, or watched for slight temperature increases as a sign of a WIMP collision rather than flashes of light.</p>



<p>For that matter, WIMPs might not be what theorists originally thought. DAMA initially reported 60 proton-mass WIMPs based on the belief that the WIMPs collided with iodine atoms. But later data suggested that perhaps the WIMPs were hitting sodium atoms, implying a much lighter WIMP mass — lighter than other experiments had been optimally designed to detect. Yet another possibility: Maybe trace amounts of the metallic element thallium (much heavier atoms than either iodine or sodium) had been the WIMP targets. But a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08367">recent review</a> of that proposal found once again that the DAMA results could not be reconciled with the absence of a signal in other experiments.</p>



<p>And now DAMA’s hope for vindication has been further dashed by a new underground experiment, this one in Spain. Scientists with <a href="https://gifna.unizar.es/anais/">the ANAIS collaboration</a> have repeated the June-December method with sodium iodide, in an effort to reproduce DAMA’s results with the same method and materials. After three years of operation, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01175">ANAIS team reports</a> no sign of WIMPs.</p>



<p>To be fair, the no-WIMP conclusion relies on a lot of seriously sophisticated technical analysis. It’s not just a matter of counting light flashes. You have to collect rigorous data on the behavior of nine different sodium iodide modules. You have to correct for the presence of rare radioactive isotopes generated by cosmic ray collisions while the modules were still under construction. And then the statistical analysis needed to discern a winter-summer signal difference is not something you should try at home (unless you’re fully versed in things like the least-square periodogram or the Lomb-Scargle technique). Plus, ANAIS it still going, with plans to collect two more years of data before issuing a final analysis. So the judgment on DAMA’s WIMPs is not necessarily final.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it doesn’t look good for WIMPs, at least for the WIMPs motivated by belief in supersymmetry.   </p>



<p>Sadly for SUSY fans, searches for WIMPs from space are not the only bad news. Attempts to produce WIMPs in particle accelerators have also so far failed. Dark matter might just turn out to consist of some other kind of subatomic particle.</p>



<p>If so, it would be a plot twist worthy of Agatha Christie, kind of like Poirot turning out to be the killer. For symmetry has long been physicists’ most reliable friend, guiding many great successes, from Einstein’s relativity theory to the standard model of particles and forces.</p>



<p>Still, failure to find SUSY particles so far does not necessarily mean they don’t exist. Supersymmetry just might be not as simple as it first seemed. And SUSY particles might just be harder to detect than scientists originally surmised. But if supersymmetry does turn out not to be so super, scientists might need to reflect on the ways that faith in symmetry can lead them astray.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/west-nile-virus-low-light-pollution-risk-sentinel-chickens">Dim lighting may raise the risk of a West Nile virus exposure</a></h4>

<p>Don’t dim the lights. A survey using more than 6,000 chickens across Florida shows that <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0253">low levels of light pollution</a> may increase the risk for West Nile virus exposure, researchers report March 24 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Meredith Kernbach, a disease ecologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa, had previously shown that low light at night increased the time that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-prolong-risk-sparrows-passing-along-west-nile-virus">sparrows infected with West Nile</a> were capable of passing on the disease (<em>SN: 1/19/18</em>). She and her colleagues wanted to know if light pollution might also increase the disease’s natural spread in the suburbs.</p>



<p>Cue the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chickens-mosquito-borne-disease-florida">sentinel chickens</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/19</em>). The team coupled four years of data from these chickens, kept in coops across the state to monitor the spread of diseases, with a world atlas of artificial night sky brightness. Chickens tested positive for antibodies to West Nile virus more often when there was a little bit of light than in bright light or no light at all, the data showed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="chickens in an oudoor coop" class="wp-image-3097723" height="503" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032321_bb_west-nile-virus_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097723">They may not seem like heroes, but these chickens are standing noble sentry against diseases such as West Nile virus in Florida. Blood tests keep track of any diseases that might present a danger to humans.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097723">Thomas Unnasch/University of South Florida</span></figure>



<p>“Where there’s no light pollution, there’s very low exposure risk,” Kernbach says. “And then as you move into these areas of dim light pollution, the exposure risk goes way up.” In bright areas, risk drops again. Those dimly lit areas correspond to suburbs and some rural areas, Kernbach says.</p>



<p>Obviously, chickens getting mosquito bites aren’t humans getting West Nile virus. But the findings could help explain why West Nile virus, the most common mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States, is so closely associated with human environments. </p>



<p>The researchers showed sky brightness was a better predictor of West Nile exposure than human density or paved surfaces — two other environmental factors thought to predict spread. But this study has only begun to shed light on why this happens, Kernbach notes. “We have a reason to look at this now and …understand what is it about light pollution that’s driving this.”</p>

<p>Our ongoing partnership with <a href="http://protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> led to a new and exciting <em>PLOS ONE </em>article type, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-lab-protocols">Lab Protocols</a>, which offers a new avenue to share research in-line with the principles of Open Science. This two-part article type gives authors the best of both platforms: protocols.io hosts the step-by-step methodology details while <em>PLOS ONE</em> publishes a companion article that contextualizes the study and orchestrates peer review of the material. The end result is transparent and reproducible research that can help accelerate scientific discovery. </p>



<p>Read our interview with protocols.io CEO and co-founder Dr. Lenny Teytelman where he discusses what triggered the concept for the company, how researchers can benefit from this collaboration and how his team settled on such an adorable racoon logo.</p>



<p><em><strong>For those who are unfamiliar, what is protocols.io? </strong></em></p>



<p>It is a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It serves both researchers needing secure and private collaboration and those aiming to share their knowledge publicly.</p>



<p><em><strong>What was the inspiration behind protocols.io? Did you have any particular experiences or issues as a researcher that led to you believing protocol sharing was an under-supported element of the scientific community? </strong></em></p>



<p>It was a year and a half of my postdoc that went into correcting just a single step of the microscopy methods that I was using. Instead of a microliter of a chemical, the step needed five, and instead of a fifteen-minute incubation with it, it needed an hour. The problem is that this isn’t a new technique but is a correction of a previously-published method. That means I didn’t get any credit for that year and a half, and everyone using this method was either getting misleading results or had to spend one or two years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering what I’d love to share with them, but didn’t have a good way of doing.</p>



<p>This is the experience that led to my obsession with creating a central place to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge, within research groups and companies and broadly with the world.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As authors of <em>PLOS ONE</em> began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines had a need for a dedicated tool for proper method sharing… We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.</p><cite>– Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><em><strong>Protocols.io launched in 2014 — how were the first few years? How were you able to make yourself known and show that your product is worthwhile and secure for researchers? </strong></em></p>



<p>Oh, you just touched on a painful topic. I actually gave a talk at a conference in 2018, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJwKXZsmi4">The harsh lessons from 4 years of community building at protocols.io</a>. The first years were surprisingly rough. As an academic with zero entrepreneurial experience, I naively expected that once we build the platform, I’d tell my scientist friends that it exists, and through word of mouth, it would go viral. Turns out that it is not how new initiatives work. There is a lot of dedicated work needed to build the trust and visibility and simply let researchers know that you exist.</p>



<p>It took the support of publishers, societies, funders, and Open Science and reproducibility champions to climb out of obscurity. Speaking of that support, the 2017 <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/">partnership</a> between PLOS and protocols.io was critical in helping the research community learn about protocols.io.</p>



<p><em><strong>How has the platform evolved since then? What elements have been consistent and what have been some major changes? </strong></em></p>



<p>Our vision and mission have not really changed since 2014, but thanks to the constant feedback of the research community and a brilliant CTO and co-founder Alexei Stoliartchouk listening to that input, the product has grown from a rudimentary website to a powerful tool with amazing functionality to support the sharing of the method details and to help in the daily work of the researcher. For a fun comparison of where we were at launch in February 2014, take a look at our Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1881346585/protocolsio-life-sciences-protocol-repository">video</a>.</p>



<p>One of the early changes was in scope, a year after we launched. We initially thought that this is a platform for experimental wetlab scientists, but soon after launch, requests started to come to expand it to support computational/bioinformatics workflows. And then in 2017, there was another expansion in scope, catalyzed by that same 2017 partnership with PLOS. As authors of <em>PLOS ONE</em> began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines needed a dedicated tool for proper method sharing. This actually led us to change our welcome page from “Repository for Life Science Methods” to “Repository for Research Methods.” We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.</p>



<p><em><strong>How important is the new PLOS ONE Lab Protocol article type to the journey and mission of protocols.io? </strong></em></p>



<p>Soon after our launch, when I realized that things don’t just “go viral”, I began to think a lot about incentives. It occurred to me some time in 2015 that it would be amazing if researchers had a way of turning their protocols into peer reviewed papers. I was looking at the <em>F1000Research</em> model and wondering if we could add peer review to protocols.io. The problem was that our scope was so broad, we would need thousands of academic editors to be able to support the peer review — essentially we’d have to build <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Then, in 2017 when we started working with PLOS, I realized, “We don’t have to build <em>PLOS ONE</em>! It already exists; we just need to partner!”</p>



<p>And while this partnership is a big deal for protocols.io, I am particularly excited about it because of what it can do for reproducibility and Open Science. As I said when we <a href="https://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-announces-two-new-peer-reviewed-article-types-for-plos-one/">announced</a> the launch, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with PLOS by launching this new modular article type. This will provide authors with all of the benefits of rigorous peer review, plus a dynamic and interactive platform to present their protocols, with support for videos and precise details that are important for adopting and building upon the published methods.”</p>

<p><em><strong>PLOS and protocols.io have similar mission statements and nearby offices: how did this collaboration with PLOS start? </strong></em></p>



<p>Many people assume that our collaboration with PLOS is a consequence of me being co-advised as a graduate student by Professor Michael Eisen, co-founder of PLOS. That actually is not the case. It is true that as soon as I realized in 2012 that something like protocols.io needs to be built, I called Professor Eisen, described the idea, and said, “PLOS should build such a platform.” But he replied, “PLOS is a publisher, not a software developer. You need to build it.”</p>



<p>So in fact, it is the Chief Science Officer of PLOS, Dr. Veronique Kiermer, who is the key early lead on the PLOS/protocols.io connection. Dr. Kiermer was the founding editor of <em>Nature Methods</em> and has a passion for reproducibility and a deep appreciation for the essential role that protocols play in the research cycle. We met at an Open Access mixer in San Francisco when she had just moved to PLOS. As I showed her what we had built, she asked countless questions of “can it do this and that” and I showed her the “yes” answers right on my phone. She got excited and said, “This is exactly what I always dreamed of. We should do something together!”</p>



<p><em><strong>What has the COVID-19 pandemic taught you about the importance of Open Science and supporting collaborative research opportunities? </strong></em></p>



<p>I’ve been stunned by the extent of rapid sharing and collaborative spirit in the research world, united against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is how you ideally imagine science working. It is how science should work. We’ve seen a remarkable level of rapid method sharing in the SARS-CoV-2 <a href="https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/coronavirus-method-development-community/publications?sort=views">group</a>. But it’s not just the methods; researchers are sharing data, preprints, code in precisely the way that accelerates and amplifies everyone’s efforts around the globe.</p>



<p>I am simultaneously inspired by what I see and frustrated that this isn’t yet the norm. I’ve been watching the world and publishers declare in 2015 that rapid sharing and immediate Open Access are essential for Ebola research. Then the same in 2016 for Zika. Then 2019 for all research related to the opioid crisis. In 2020 and 2021 it’s COVID-19. It’s frustrating that we make exceptions for pandemics and crises and then go back to the traditional stunted way of sharing. </p>



<p>What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.</p>



<p><em><strong>What’s next for protocols.io? (How can you continue to help scientists adopt Open Science activities?) </strong></em></p>



<p>The beautiful part of our growth (we have over 9,000 public protocols now and have been roughly doubling every year since our launch), is that with increased sharing and researchers on protocols.io we also have received more feedback and requests than ever. As more requests and suggestions come in, our appetite for improving and enhancing the platform only increases. It’s kind of like with research itself – each answer leads to more questions and more thirst for experiments. </p>



<p>We are also genuinely excited about the <em>PLOS ONE</em> Lab Protocols and we look forward to the first papers being published and to the future developments in this partnership. We’re just getting started.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>“The pen is mightier than the keyboard”… in other words, it’s better to take lecture notes with a pen and paper rather than a laptop. That was the hugely influential conclusion of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581">a paper</a> published in 2014, by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer. The work was picked up by media around the world, and has received extensive academic attention; it’s been cited more than 1,100 times and, the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965541">new paper</a>, also in <em>Psychological Science</em>, point out, it often features in discussions among educators about whether or not to ban laptops from classrooms. However, when Heather Urry at Tufts University, US, and her colleagues ran a direct replication of that original study, their findings told a different story. And it’s one that the team’s additional mini meta-analysis of other directly comparable replications supported: when later quizzed on the contents of a talk, participants who’d taken notes with a pen and paper did no better than those who’d used a laptop.</p>



<span id="more-41640"></span>



<p>In the new replication, as in the original study, the 142 participants were all university students (this time at Tufts, rather than Princeton), who took notes while watching one of five roughly 15-minute-long TED talks. As before, there was then a roughly 30-minute delay during which they completed distractor tasks. After this, they completed a quiz on the facts and concepts presented in the talk.  </p>



<p>When the team analysed the data, they found that, as in the original study, participants who’d used a laptop to take notes recorded more words overall, and more verbatim phrases from the talk. Also as before, both groups performed equally well when it came to recalling the factual content of the talks. However, while Mueller and Oppenheimer found an advantage for longhand note-taking on the recall of concepts presented in the talks, Urry and her colleagues did not.</p>



<p>Despite the team’s efforts to replicate the original study as closely as possible, there were some differences between the two, however — including some that the researchers acknowledge could have affected the results. For example, more of the participants in the new study reported typically using taking class notes by hand. Also, in the original research, participants completed the study in a classroom, mostly in groups of two, and watched the talks on a screen at the front of the room. In this new research, about 80 of the participants completed the study outside of a class, and they viewed the talk on a laptop provided by the team. Many of these participants “noted that session were subject to distractions and errors,” the authors comment. This might have influenced the results.</p>



<p>Also, this is of course only one replication. So the team identified a total of eight studies (including theirs and two from the original paper) that they felt were sufficiently similar to be directly compared. This mini meta-analysis produced also failed to find an advantage for longhand note-taking on conceptual recall. </p>



<p>Urry and her colleagues do accept that there were some limitations to all of these studies, including theirs. For example, TED talks are brief, and not hugely similar to typical university lectures; there are no pauses for extra note-taking or questions, for example. “Future studies should use approaches that better represent real-world settings,” the team recommends. Future studies should also consider new note-taking strategies (such as the use of styluses to write notes on a paper-like screen) as well as individual participants’ note-taking preferences. Also, there was only a 30-minute delay between watching the talk and being quizzed on it; this is not typical of real world university learning, either, so suggests caution in extrapolating from these results to likely impacts on actual students.</p>



<p>Still, given the influence of the original 2014 study, it’s important to note this failure to replicate, and the researchers’ cautionary conclusion: “Until future research determines whether and when note-taking media influence academic performance, we conclude that students and professors who are concerned about detrimental effects of computer note-taking on encoding information to be learned in lectures may not need to ditch the laptop just yet.”</p>



<p>– <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965541">Don’t Ditch the Laptop Just Yet: A Direct Replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer’s (2014) Study 1 Plus Mini Meta-Analyses Across Similar Studies</a></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-turtles-penguins-sharks-why-swim-circles-biology">Why do sea turtles, penguins and sharks sometimes just swim in circles or spirals?</a></h4>

<p>Marine science has its own crop circle mysteries. Sea turtles, sharks, penguins and even whales sometimes just go circular, swimming around and around in a loop or spiral. The puzzles are not whodunits so much as whydoits.</p>



<p>“I doubted my eyes when I first saw the data,” says marine biologist Tomoko Narazaki of the University of Tokyo. A green sea turtle (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) she and colleagues tagged near an African island with good places for laying eggs made a total of 26 circles. The turtle turning and turning underwater swam “like a machine,” Narazaki says.</p>



<p>When Narazaki got home and enthused to her institute colleagues, she found that they had recorded circling or spiraling bouts now and then in other marine animals.  Going back more than a decade, 3-D data-logging devices fastened on 10 sea species as diverse as king penguins and a Cuvier’s beaked whale had picked up enough detail <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00189-9">to reconstruct the animals’ circles</a> and squiggles, Narazaki and colleagues report March 18 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>It’s easy to imagine what’s going on with some of the swimmers: Tiger sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>) looping around during the deep phase of their plunges to depths near the Hawaiian Islands are probably circling in search of prey.  Other researchers have found humpback whales whooshing around creating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-bubble-nets">circular death traps of bubbles</a> that keep prey in a dense, gulpable mass (S<em>N: 11/9/19</em>). But some acrobatics get more mysterious.</p>





<p>The green sea turtle that amazed Narazaki was circling steadily — no lunges or exploratory side-loopings —so the researchers doubt the animal was looking for food. Narazaki saw this behavior while tracking a turtle that researchers had moved off-course on its way to lay eggs. The turtle didn’t swim bouts of repeated circles until near the inviting island. That circling may have had something to do with getting a good read on an important location, perhaps checking the geomagnetic field, the researchers propose. They note that submarines also circle as they take geomagnetic data.</p>

<h3>A Cuvier’s beaked whale’s path to the surface</h3>



<p>Researchers recorded a Cuvier’s beaked whale’s puzzling trip up to the surface from a deep dive. At first, the whale angles upward from the bottom in a fairly straight line. Then, for reasons unknown to researchers, the whale switches to a loose corkscrew upward for the last 600 meters or so. Its movements northward and eastward for this part of its tracked swim are marked off in 50-meter increments in this diagram, while its depth is marked off in 200-meter increments.</p>

<p>“This might be similar to what humans often do when hiking through wilderness,” says Kenneth Lohmann, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When turning off a path, we often take a special look around the crucial spot so we can retrace our steps. Lohmann has studied direction finding in hatchling sea turtles, and can imagine the adult green turtles checking not just the magnetic field, but a variety of location clues including chemical traces and sounds.</p>



<p>One of the new paper’s more puzzling curled paths followed a Cuvier’s beaked whale (<em>Ziphius cavirostris</em>) coming up from a deep dive. Its route angled up in a relatively straight line from around the depths until roughly 640 meters from the surface. Then the whale started spiraling upward in wide curlicues.</p>



<p>Several possible explanations come to mind, says Sascha Kate Hooker, from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, who studies dive physiology in marine mammals. In theory, deep-plunging whales could risk getting the bends if they swim upward too fast, she has calculated. A slower ascent, with loops, might reduce that risk.</p>





<p>Yet speeds vary so much in rising beaked whales there must be more than basic physiology in play, Hooker says. She’s convinced by other researchers that evading the killer whales matters a lot on these upward trips. A straight path can take the beaked whale a kilometer (horizontally) away from its starting point in the depths. So spirals might let the animal cover the distance upward and start looking for its companions without moving so far off. ‘I wonder if this relatively passive second half of the ascent, staying in the same spot, would help animals regroup,” she says.</p>



<p>King penguins (<em>Aptenodytes patagonicus</em>) don’t forage as deeply as beaked whales but do swim circles near the surface, Narazaki reports. If they’re circling rather slowly, they might just be preening their feathers, a vital task for maintaining insulation in Antarctic waters, says Manfred Enstipp of Hubert CURIEN Multidisciplinary Institute in Strasbourg, France, who also has studied these birds. If the penguins are circling fast though, the muscle activity might help them get blood flowing and warm up. So that’s another possible comparison with humans outdoors, stamping our feet to warm up on a winter’s day, maybe even turning in little mystery circles ourselves.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-new-upcoming-pill-electricity">Here’s what makes 4 promising COVID-19 vaccines unique — and potentially useful</a></h4>

<p>Barely a year after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, 11 vaccines worldwide have been granted emergency use authorization or given full approval. Millions of shots are going into arms every day: As of March 19, 410 million people around the world have gotten the jabs.</p>



<p>As mind-boggling as that is, it still falls far short of the need.  </p>



<p>Those 11 vaccines “will not be enough to fulfill the global need in the short term,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. Of the more than 7 billion people on Earth, only about 1.2 percent of the world’s population is now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. “We need as many vaccines over the finish line as can get through the scientific process,” she says.</p>



<p>Help may be on the way. Another 251 COVID-19 vaccines are at some stage of development with 60 far enough along to be tested in people, says Carly Gasca, senior associate at FasterCures.</p>

<p>Some vaccines are close to the finish line. For example, one made by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">Novavax</a> of Gaithersburg, Md., may soon request emergency use authorization in the United States and other countries. But vaccines in the pipeline can fail at any stage. Already at least four vaccine candidates have been abandoned, including <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-discontinues-development-of-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-continues-development-of-two-investigational-therapeutic-candidates/">two from pharmaceutical giant Merck</a> that failed to generate immune responses as strong as those from natural infections. That company is now helping produce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose vaccine</a> (<em>SN: 2/27/21</em>).</p>



<p>Among the hurdles: The already-in-use vaccines have set a high bar. For instance, mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have proven to have about 94 to 95 percent efficacy in clinical trials and in real-world situations and may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">protect against infection and disease</a> after just one shot (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). And finding people willing to participate in gold-standard clinical trials in which they might get a placebo instead of a vaccine could be tough, especially in countries where other authorized vaccines are available.</p>



<p>“You have to have something super über-duper special about your product to survive in this environment,” says Onyema Ogbuagu, a virologist who heads COVID-19 clinical trials at Yale School of Medicine.</p>



<p>That edge could come from logistics. To be effective, vaccines have to get into people’s bodies. So unlike the Pfizer and Moderna shots, vaccines that don’t have to be frozen have a better chance of being used in rural or remote areas and places that don’t have resources to buy and maintain freezers, Gasca says.  </p>



<p>Or an edge could come from an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-variants-reinfection-vaccination-efforts">ability to handle emerging variants of the coronavirus</a> that may be more infectious, more deadly or both (<em>SN: 2/5/21</em>). “The variants emerging are changing the landscape of the kind of virus we’re fighting now versus the virus that we were fighting in the fall and in the summer,” Krofah says. New vaccines may need to combat even more variants.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at some of the novel ways vaccine makers are approaching these challenges.  </p>



<h4>COVAXX</h4>



<p><strong>How it works: </strong><a href="https://www.covaxx.com/vaccine">COVAXX</a> designed small pieces of protein, called peptides, from several of the proteins from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Peptides mimic important structures within the coronavirus proteins, including a part of the spike protein used to break into cells. When injected into the body, the lab-made peptides prod the immune system to build antibodies and gear up other immune cells to attack the coronavirus should the vaccinated person encounter it later. (The Dallas-based company is not connected to the similarly named World Health Organization’s <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax">COVAX program</a> that distributes vaccines to low-income countries.)</p>



<p><strong>How it’s different:</strong> While other vaccines, including Novavax’s candidate, use the entire spike protein, COVAXX has homed in on portions of coronavirus proteins that are important for function and are likely to provoke a reaction from the immune system. The vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperature.</p>



<p><strong>Clinical trial status:</strong> The company completed <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210208005198/en/COVAXX%E2%80%99s-COVID-19-Vaccine-UB-612-Induced-Neutralizing-Antibodies-in-100-of-Participants-During-Phase-1-Clinical-Trial">Phase I testing for safety and the ability to rev up the immune system in 60 adults</a>. All of the volunteers made antibodies and had immune cells known as T cells and B cells trained to recognize the coronavirus in the event of future encounters. Participants had only mild side effects, with few people reporting symptoms such as fever and fatigue.</p>

<p>COVAXX is doing Phase II testing in Taiwan to learn more about the immune response and side effects. Phase II and III testing will begin soon in Brazil to determine the vaccine’s efficacy.</p>



<p><strong>Combating variants</strong>: The company is already working a second generation of the vaccine that could work against multiple variants, says COVAXX cofounder Mei Mei Hu.   </p>



<p><strong>Thoughts on being behind:</strong> “I never thought this was winner takes all,” Hu says. “The demand is still incredible, and even when it is met, there will continue to be unmet needs,” including vaccines that can tackle variants, vaccines that work well for people with suppressed immune systems, vaccines for children and vaccines that can mix and match with others in case booster shots are needed.</p>



<h4>Vaxart</h4>



<p><strong>How it works:</strong> The San Francisco–based company engineered a common cold virus called an adenovirus to carry instructions for making two coronavirus proteins into human cells.  There, the proteins can be made to prime the immune system to later fend off the coronavirus.</p>



<p><strong>How it’s different: </strong>Vaxart’s vaccine is a pill: It can be swallowed instead of injected. The tablets can be stored at room temperature and don’t need trained medical workers or equipment to administer. That could make the pill ideal for sending booster doses through the mail or using in hard-to-reach places where keeping vaccines cold is difficult. And people who are afraid of needles might like a tablet alternative.</p>



<p>Taking the vaccine orally also may produce more of an immune response in the mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth, throat and digestive tract than injected vaccines do, says Sean Tucker, Vaxart’s founder and chief scientific officer.</p>



<p>Other vaccines already in use, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and CanSino vaccines, also contain engineered adenoviruses. But those vaccines have instructions for making just one coronavirus protein, the famous spike protein. Vaxart’s vaccine contains instructions for making the spike protein, and also for the nucleocapsid, or N protein. The N protein is important for replication and assembly of the coronavirus. It provides another target for antibodies that can shut the virus down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Vaxart COVID-19 vaccine pills" class="wp-image-3097627" height="359" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031821_ts_vaccines_inline2_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097627">A new COVID-19 vaccine in pill form (shown) might provide easy ways to get inoculations and boosters to people even in hard-to-reach places.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097627">Vaxart Inc.</span></figure>



<p><strong>Clinical trial status:</strong> Because the vaccine works in airways and the digestive tract, it is difficult to directly compare with injected vaccines, Tucker says. But the vaccine appears to generate antibodies against both the spike and N proteins and revs up T cells to combat the virus, according to <a href="https://www.nyas.org/events/2021/webinar-the-quest-for-a-covid-19-vaccine/">preliminary results</a> from a small Phase I trial to test safety and immune responses. Full results are expected soon.</p>



<p>Side effects were generally mild. Some who took a high dose experienced diarrhea and nausea. Those symptoms are not usually seen with injected vaccines. A lower dose of the tablet vaccine didn’t produce those symptoms.</p>



<p>The company will soon begin a Phase IIa study to determine the optimal dose of the vaccine, and Tucker says the team hopes to start an efficacy study later this year.</p>



<p><strong>Combating variants</strong>: Even though the spike protein has undergone many changes, the N protein hasn’t altered much. The difference between the N proteins in the B.1.351 variant first described in South Africa and the original SARS-CoV-2 is just one amino acid. Hopefully that will mean antibodies and T cells against the N protein can neutralize variants as well as they do the original virus, Tucker says. Meanwhile, he says, “we are looking at new versions of the vaccines in research and will test preclinically [in animals or cells] to see if there are advantages to making new matched vaccines.” </p>



<p><strong>Thoughts on being behind:</strong> The coronavirus may never go away entirely. If it behaves like coronaviruses that cause the common cold, people may get reinfected every two to five years. “I think our vaccine could be a great second-generation solution,” Tucker says. The pill vaccine might be an easy way to deliver boosters to people who have gotten other COVID-19 vaccines, he says.</p>



<h4>Valneva</h4>



<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Valneva’s vaccine is an inactivated, or “killed,” version of SARS-CoV-2. The virus used in the vaccine was isolated from a patient in Italy. Then, Valneva’s scientists engineered it to lack a protein necessary for the virus to replicate. The vaccine virus has to be grown in monkey cells, which have been engineered to make the missing viral protein. Human cells don’t normally produce that protein, so the vaccine virus can’t replicate and cause disease, but can still stimulate immune responses.</p>



<p>Although inactivated vaccines have been used for decades, “our vaccine is not any less modern than any of the others,” says Thomas Lingelbach, the Saint-Herblain, France-based company’s president and chief executive officer.</p>



<p><strong>How it’s different:</strong> Its engineering is different. Several inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, including ones made by the Chinese companies Sinopharm and Sinovac and by Bharat Biotech in India, are in use around the world. But those viruses are killed by dousing them in chemicals instead of engineering the virus the way Valneva has.</p>



<p><strong>Clinical trial status:</strong> Results from a <a href="https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-commences-manufacturing-of-its-inactivated-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-completes-phase-1-2-study-recruitment/">Phase I/II study</a> are expected in April.</p>



<p><strong>Combating variants</strong>: Because the vaccine contains the whole virus (minus one protein), variants that have tweaks in their spike protein may not be as big a problem for Valneva’s vaccines as for other vaccines. There are a lot of other parts of the virus for the immune system to recognize. The company is also working on creating versions of the vaccine based on strains circulating in people.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on being behind:</strong> “We’re not entirely unhappy to be a bit slower,” Lingelbach says. The company may be able to build on other vaccines’ successes and learn from their failures. By comparing immune responses from its vaccine with already established vaccines, the company may be able to get hints of its vaccine’s efficacy early on in its development rather than having to wait for a Phase III trial. Regulators eventually may allow head-to-head comparisons of efficacy — as is commonly done with new flu vaccines — rather than testing each vaccine against a placebo.</p>



<h4>INOVIO</h4>



<p><strong>How it works:</strong> DNA instructions for building the coronavirus spike protein are zapped into the skin with a split-second pulse of electricity. From there, cells in the body produce the spike protein and cue the immune defenses.</p>



<p><strong>How it’s different:</strong> No other vaccine has this delivery method. Electrical pulses that push the DNA into cells are made by a handheld device that resembles an electric toothbrush. Some people report that the zap is less painful than a needle stick.</p>



<p>The vaccine may produce fewer side effects than some already in use.  “We haven’t seen fatigue and fever and other systemic effects,” says Joseph Kim, INOVIO’s chief executive officer. Kim speculates it may be because the vaccine contains only DNA and saline, or because different types of cells may take up the DNA than are affected by injected vaccines. Only five of 40 people tested in a Phase I study reported any <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30433-8/fulltext">side effects</a>, and all of those were mild, researchers reported December 23 in <em>EClinicalMedicine</em>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the vaccine can be stored for a year at room temperature and for five years in a refrigerator.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="INOVIO's Cellectra device" class="wp-image-3097628" height="402" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031821_ts_vaccines_inline3_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097628">Instead of needles, INOVIO will use its Cellectra device (shown) to zap its DNA vaccine into people’s arms with a split-second pulse of electricity.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097628">INOVIO</span></figure>



<p><strong>Clinical trial status: </strong>Results from the Phase I study indicate that people make antibodies against the coronavirus at higher levels, on average, than those given the Johnson &amp; Johnson and Sinovac vaccines, which use adenoviruses to deliver DNA instructions for building the spike protein to human cells, Kim says. It’s unclear why. And while antibody levels were lower than those produced by the mRNA vaccines, the DNA vaccine does a good job of revving up T cells to fight the coronavirus.  </p>



<p>INOVIO has started Phase II testing of its vaccine, with early results expected soon. A Phase III trial will start once the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clears a commercial version of the DNA delivery device to be used in the trial.</p>



<p><strong>Combating variants</strong>: The company is testing whether antibodies made against the vaccine can still fight off the variants. In addition, INOVIO, headquartered in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., hopes to engineer a universal COVID vaccine that could fight off known and unknown versions of SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<p><strong>Thoughts on being behind:</strong> The company isn’t worried about standing out against other vaccines, Kim says. “We have several advantages as a vaccine,” he says. “We are extremely motivated to get to our efficacy trial.… We’re working very eagerly and passionately to make sure that INO-4800 is one of the arsenals that global health will have to fight this infection around the world.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective-us-trial-results">AstraZeneca says its COVID-19 vaccine is 79 percent effective in a U.S. trial</a></h4>

<p>The coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford was effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms, the company reported March 22 based on a clinical trial of more than 30,000 people in the United States, Chile and Peru.</p>



<p>It’s the biggest trial to date for the vaccine, which has been beset by dosing mix-ups and fears that it could cause some people to develop dangerous blood clots. And in another stumble, AstraZeneca <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaid-statement-astrazeneca-vaccine">may have included outdated information from the trial for the interim analysis</a> in reporting its results, “which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in a March 23 statement.  </p>



<p>The interim analysis was based on data <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-following-statement-by-niaid-on-azd1222-us-phase-iii-trial-data.html">collected until February 17</a>, AstraZeneca said in reply in a statement. The pharmaceutical company said it plans to release updated results within two days.</p>



<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happened. This is really what you call an unforced error,” Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, said March 23 on ABC’s Good Morning America. “The fact is this is very likely a very good vaccine and this kind of thing does… nothing but cast some doubt about the vaccines and maybe contribute to hesitancy.”</p>





<p>Still, the vaccine’s success — which if it holds is expected to pave the way for AstraZeneca to apply for emergency use authorization in the United States — is good news, says William Schaffner, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</p>



<p>“The more the merrier,” Schaffner says. Three other vaccines — Pfizer/BioNTech’s, Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — have gotten that authorization so far.</p>



<p>AstraZeneca’s shot was <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html">79 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms</a> in the trial’s 32,449 participants, the company announced March 22 in a news release. Around 20,000 of those participants got the vaccine while the rest received a placebo.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Approximately 60 percent of participants in the trial have health conditions that put them at risk for getting really sick with COVID-19. The vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization, AstraZeneca reports. But only five people in the placebo group suffered severe disease, according to information from a World Health Organization briefing. That small number of severe COVID-19 cases makes it difficult to determine the vaccine’s exact efficacy against the worst symptoms.   </p>



<p>The shot was also 80 percent effective at preventing illness in trial participants aged 65 and older, an age group at high risk for severe COVID-19. The immune system can weaken with age, so strong protection in such a high-risk group is crucial for keeping people out of the hospital. </p>



<p>A total of 141 participants developed symptomatic COVID-19 in the trial, though the news release did not specify how many cases were in people who got the vaccine or the placebo.  Researchers still don’t know whether the vaccine prevents infection overall, which would further help curb coronavirus transmission.</p>



<p>The latest trial results did find the vaccine is safe. Many countries in Europe had suspended use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine over concerns it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts">could be linked to blood clots</a>, including rare reports of clots that block sinuses that drain blood from the brain (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). An independent safety review of the new data revealed no connection to blood clots and reported no cases of sinus clots, the company said in the March 22 statement. The statement did not list other side effects but said “the vaccine was well-tolerated.” If the shot is OK’d for use in the United States, the country’s strong surveillance system should quickly pick up any conditions that might be linked to the vaccine, Schaffner says.</p>

</aside>



<p>The clinical trial’s findings have not yet been reviewed by independent scientists, but AstraZeneca plans to submit the interim data in the coming weeks to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to apply for emergency use authorization. The FDA recommends that authorized vaccines reduce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean">COVID-19 cases by half</a> in vaccinated people compared with those who received a placebo (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). AstraZeneca’s vaccine surpasses that benchmark.</p>



<p>The results of the new trial align with data from previous clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">also showed that the vaccine was effective at preventing illness</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/20</em>). But the U.K. trial included people who accidentally received half a dose of the vaccine followed by a full dose, rather than two full doses, making it difficult to interpret the results. Studies also suggest that spacing doses out over <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">12 weeks instead of four might increase vaccine efficacy</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).  </p>



<p>The latest clinical trial did not measure how the vaccine fared against worrisome variants of the coronavirus that now are circulating. Researchers have been concerned that some mutations in the virus could dampen the ability of the immune response sparked by a vaccine to recognize emerging variants.</p>



<p>AstraZeneca’s vaccine, for instance, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214?query=TOC">performed poorly against a variant</a> called B.1.351, first identified in South Africa, researchers report March 16 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. In that trial, the vaccine was only 10.4 percent effective at preventing mild or moderate COVID-19. The B.1.351 variant carries a mutation that appears to help the virus evade immune responses raised against the original form of the virus that sparked the pandemic. </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Tolerance is often touted as a progressive value, a way of ensuring that society offers equal opportunities to all. But it can also imply “putting up with” something or someone you fundamentally disagree with or dislike — being tolerated isn’t the same as being genuinely valued or respected, for example. As one <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-politics-of-toleration-in-modern-life">writer</a> puts it, tolerance has echoes “of at best grudging acceptance, and at worst ill-disguised hostility”.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12492?af=R">new study</a> in the<em> British Journal of Psychology</em> has found that the experience of being tolerated takes its toll on the wellbeing of ethnic minorities in the United States. Sara Cvetkovska from Utrecht University and colleagues find that the experience of being tolerated is closer to discrimination than it is to acceptance — impacting overall wellbeing and increasing negative mood.</p>



<span id="more-41625"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team looked at how wellbeing related to the experience of being tolerated, compared to being accepted or discriminated against outright. Participants were non-white, belonged to a racial or ethnic minority group, and ranged from 17 to 73 years old.</p>



<p>First, participants answered questions about how frequently they felt they were being tolerated, accepted or discriminated against in several social contexts — at work, school, during leisure activities, at clubs or organisations, in their neighbourhood, on social media and overall. Tolerance was described as people objecting to particular cultural beliefs or practices but “putting up” with them nonetheless; discrimination referred to unjust treatment; while acceptance was described as a genuine appreciation for certain practices or ways of life.</p>



<p>Participants then rated themselves on five facets of wellbeing: positive and negative affect, self-esteem, life satisfaction and a sense of control. And while perceived acceptance, unsurprisingly, was associated with greater positive wellbeing, tolerance was associated with lower levels, with discrimination associated with the lowest levels of all.</p>



<p>In the second study, participants were asked the same questions about how often they felt they were being tolerated, discriminated against or accepted. This time, they also took part in a writing exercise, describing a particularly vivid instance of tolerance, discrimination or acceptance which they or someone they know had experienced. Participants then completed wellbeing measures as in the first study.</p>



<p>Once again, tolerance appeared to be an intermediate state for participants: wellbeing was higher in the tolerance condition than it was in the discrimination condition, but not as high as in the acceptance condition. But only positive and negative mood were affected by the writing task — more stable facets of wellbeing like self-esteem and perceived control were not.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants read that they worked at a company with a “casual Fridays” dress code. On one Friday they had come to work wearing a shirt with symbols reflecting their ethnic group: in the acceptance condition, their boss complimented them on the t-shirt and expressed interest in understanding its significance; in the tolerance condition the boss disapproved of the t-shirt but allowed it to be worn due to “freedom of expression”; and in the discrimination condition the boss actively banned the t-shirt from the workplace.</p>



<p>The participants then reported their positive and negative affect and how much the experience would threaten their identity — for example how negatively they felt about themselves or how powerless they thought they were. Again, tolerance was linked to greater wellbeing than discrimination but lower than acceptance. This time, people’s sense of identity was less threatened in the acceptance condition than in the tolerance condition. There was no significant difference between the discrimination and tolerance conditions in terms of social identity threat, however, suggesting the two, once again, are intimately linked.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that “tolerance” may not be the best way of thinking about diversity. Though tolerance had less of a negative impact than discrimination, and while the two are distinct experiences, it was still linked to lower wellbeing than acceptance. This may be, as the team suggests, because tolerance shares the same negative appraisal of minority identity as discrimination — it’s just a bit more polite about it.</p>



<p>Future research could separate out responses somewhat: how an indigenous person experiences discrimination or tolerance is unlikely to be identical to the way a Black person would, for example. It would also be interesting to explore different kinds of relationships — in the final study, for example, the individual tolerating, accepting or discriminating was a boss. How would such behaviour impact wellbeing coming from a professional peer, another kind of authority figure, or even from a friend?</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology/">Disability, access, and the virtual conference</a></h4>

<p>After my first Zoom meeting of the pandemic, I found myself lying on the bathroom floor with my noise-cancelling headphones on, on the verge of a full-blown meltdown. As an autistic person, I’ve always been hypersensitive to noise and to visual stimuli—but I hadn’t realized that a Zoom meeting with my colleagues could cause sensory overload. The number of images on the computer screen, the amount of movement in those tiny thumb-nail images, and the speed with which the images had moved, flashed, and changed—not to mention the obtrusive noise of malfunctioning microphones and noisy, socially-distanced households—had been enough to make me physically sick. Although many people tend to assume that an online event is automatically more accessible than an in-person event (after all, people can attend without leaving their homes), this isn’t always the case. Even when online events <em>are</em> more accessible, one of the lessons the pandemic has reminded me of is that the act of creating disability access can fundamentally change the nature of the thing that is accessed.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible”</p></blockquote></div><p>In writing my new book, <em>Shakespeare and Disability Studies</em>, I was interested in exploring disability access as art and in exploring disability access as a complicated (and complicating) multifaceted phenomenon. Disability access is rarely just a question of “Can someone with X impairment use Y?” but rather more often a question of “If we modify Y so that someone with X impairment can use it, how does it change the meaning, the experience, and the effect of Y?” Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible, whether the thing made accessible is a Shakespeare play (“the play’s the thing”) or a Zoom meeting. When we change the nature of the thing made accessible, we don’t just create access and inclusion for people with disabilities—we often create a new kind of experience altogether. I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities. Sometimes those new works, events, and objects bear a resemblance to the inaccessible version from which they grew. At other times, they do not.</p><p>Perhaps the most complex possibility, and the one most fundamentally counter-intuitive to a culture in which able-bodied and neurotypical (non-autistic) thinking are prioritized, is when creating accessibility not only fundamentally changes the nature of the thing made accessible but also causes attendees with a disability to lose something valuable. This seems counter-intuitive because stereotypical ways of thinking about disability have (falsely) taught us that disability experience does not include pleasure and that eliminating barriers to access is always an inherent and uncomplicated good. Neither of these things is true. For example, this year I’ll lead seminars at two Shakespeare conferences (the Shakespeare Association of America and the World Shakespeare Congress). Because of the pandemic, both conferences, for the first time ever, will be held completely online. However, these virtual events are more complicated for me than they originally seem, and their accessibility represents both gain and loss.</p><div><blockquote><p>“I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities.”</p></blockquote></div><p>In some ways, both conferences will be more accessible for me in an online format. Traveling can be difficult for some autistic people (keeping in mind the effect of Zoom on my body and mind, imagine the effect of a crowded airport). I usually travel annually to the Shakespeare Association of America—but with much ado. I can’t fly alone (nor hope to navigate unfamiliar city streets or crowded hotels by myself) and so always travel with a support person. My support person is usually another Shakespearean, a kind volunteer who, after weathering the sensory travails of the airport and public transportation, will spend the conference with me. I am not independent. But also, I am never alone. Everything in my life is shared. There is a certain beauty in that. After a busy day of seminars and panels, I will lie on the hotel room bed in the fetal position, far too worn out from the crowds and the noise to do anything else, and my support person and I will gossip together with great pleasure about the intellectual goings-on of the conference.</p><p>Disability, in our culture, is stereotyped as loss. Accessibility, in our culture, is deemed as always good, always a gain. It is also often misunderstood as simple and one-dimensional, as easy to understand and to explain. This year, for the first time ever, I will attend the Shakespeare Association of America without a support person. I will be independent. It is important, however, to think about the enormous cost of making the conference fully accessible to me. This act of access will fundamentally change the nature of what the conference is. The only way to make the conference fully accessible to me is for its social component, its travel component, its in-person component, to be completely removed. This represents a loss for all of the people at the conference and, ironically, also a loss for me. Because after my seminar at the 2021 Shakespeare Association of America, I won’t return to my hotel room to gossip about the intellectual goings-on of the conference with my support person. Rather, I will shut down my computer and reflect silently on the events of the conference… alone… for the first time in my life.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jon Tyson</a> on Unsplash</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/">Disability, access, and the virtual conference</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/647352848/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/shape-today-and-tomorrow-qa-with-sophie-goldsworthy-and-julia-black-part-two/" rel="nofollow">SHAPE today and tomorrow: Q&amp;A with Sophie Goldsworthy and Julia Black (part two)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/introducing-shape-qa-with-sophie-goldsworthy-and-julia-black-part-one/" rel="nofollow">Introducing SHAPE: Q&amp;A with Sophie Goldsworthy and Julia Black (part one)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/victorian-3d-virtual-adventures-in-the-stereoscope/" rel="nofollow">Victorian 3D: virtual adventures in the stereoscope</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-ring-molecules-life-found-space-first-time">Carbon-ring molecules tied to life were found in space for the first time</a></h4>

<p>Complex carbon-bearing molecules that could help explain how life got started have been identified in space for the first time.</p>



<p>These molecules, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, consist of several linked hexagonal rings of carbon with hydrogen atoms at the edges. Astronomers have suspected for decades that these molecules are abundant in space, but none had been directly spotted before.</p>



<p>Simpler molecules with a single ring of carbon have been seen before. But “we’re now excited to see that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb7535">we’re able to detect these larger PAHs</a> for the first time in space,” says astrochemist Brett McGuire of MIT, whose team reports the discovery in the March 19 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Studying these molecules and others like them could help scientists understand how the chemical precursors to life might get started in space. “Carbon is such a fundamental part of chemical reactions, especially reactions leading to life’s essential molecules,” McGuire says. “This is our window into a huge reservoir of them.”</p>





<p>Since the 1980s, astronomers have seen a mysterious infrared glow coming from spots within our galaxy and others. Many suspected that the glow comes from PAHs, but could not identify a specific source. The signals from several different PAHs overlap too much to tease any one of them apart, like a choir blending so well, the ear can’t pick out individual voices.</p>



<p>Instead of searching the infrared signals for a single voice, McGuire and colleagues turned to radio waves, where different PAHs sing different songs. The team trained the powerful Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia on TMC-1, a dark cloud about 430 light-years from Earth near the constellation Taurus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="interstellar cloud TMC-1 with the pleiades cluster in the background" class="wp-image-3097647" height="485" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031821_lg_pahs_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097647">The interstellar cloud TMC-1 (top, black filaments) appears as a dark streak on the sky next to the bright Pleiades star cluster (right)</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097647">Brett A. McGuire</span></figure>



<p>Previously, McGuire had discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brett-mcguire-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">the cloud contains benzonitrile</a>, a molecule made of a single carbon ring (<em>SN: 10/2/19</em>). So he thought it was a good place to look for more complicated molecules.</p>



<p>The team detected 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene, two-ringed molecules with 10 carbons, eight hydrogens and a nitrogen atom. The concentration is fairly diffuse, McGuire says: “If you filled the inside of your average compact car with [gas from] TMC-1, you’d have less than 10 molecules of each PAH we detected.”</p>



<p>But it was a lot more than the team expected. The cloud contains between 100,000 and one million times more PAHs than theoretical models predict it should. “It’s insane, that’s way too much,” McGuire says.</p>



<p>There are two ways that PAHs are thought to form in space: out of the ashes of dead stars or by direct chemical reactions in interstellar space. Since TMC-1 is just beginning to form stars, McGuire expected that any PAHs it contains ought to have been built by direct chemical reactions in space. But that scenario can’t account for all the PAH molecules the team found. There’s too much to be explained easily by stellar ash, too. That means something is probably missing from astrochemists’ theories of how PAHs can form in space.</p>



<p>“We’re working in uncharted territory here,” he says, “which is exciting.”</p>



<p>Identifying PAHs in space is “a big thing,” says astrochemist Alessandra Ricca of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who was not involved in the new study. The work “is the first one that has shown that these PAH molecules actually do exist in space,” she says. “Before, it was just a hypothesis.”</p>



<p>Ricca’s group is working on a database of infrared PAH signals that the James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch in October, can look for. “All this is going to be very helpful for JWST and the research on carbon in the universe,” she says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migraine-headache-new-drugs-block-brain-chemical">New drugs that block a brain chemical are game changers for some migraine sufferers</a></h4>

<p>Hayley Gudgin of Sammamish, Wash., got her first migraine in 1991 when she was a 19-year-old nursing student.</p>



<p>“I was convinced I was having a brain hemorrhage,” she says. “There was no way anything could be that painful and not be really serious.”</p>



<p>She retreated to her bed and woke up feeling better the next day. But it wasn’t long until another migraine hit. And another. Taking a pill that combines caffeine with the pain relievers acetaminophen and codeine made life manageable until she got pregnant and had to stop taking her medication. After her son was born, the migraines came back. She started taking the drugs again, but they didn’t work and actually made her attacks worse.</p>



<p>By the time Gudgin gave birth to her second son in 1997, she was having about 15 attacks a month. Her symptoms worsened over time and included severe pain, nausea, sensitivity to light, swollen hands, difficulty speaking, vomiting and diarrhea so intense she often wound up dehydrated in the emergency room.</p>





<p>“It hit me [that] I had to do something when I was vomiting in the toilet, and my 3-year-old came and pulled my hair back,” she says. “It was no way to live — and not just because of the pain. You go to sleep every night not knowing how you’re going to wake up. You make plans knowing you might have to cancel them.”</p>



<p>A headache specialist prescribed several preventive medicines, but each caused side effects for Gudgin, including weight gain and kidney stones. Then, in 2018, Gudgin read about a new type of treatment for frequent migraine sufferers. Her neurologist agreed it was worth a try. After much wrangling with her insurance company — the drug is costly, and she had to prove that two other drugs had failed to help her — she got approval to take it.</p>



<p>In August 2018, Gudgin received her first monthly injection of erenumab, sold as Aimovig. By the end of September, she was down to one or two attacks a month. “And the migraines I do get are usually gone within six hours. I don’t have to go to the ER or lie in a dark room all day,” she says. “It’s just been life changing.”</p>



<p>Gudgin injects the drug into her leg once a month using a device similar to an EpiPen. Erenumab is one of four monoclonal antibodies, manufactured proteins that can bind to substances in the body, that have been approved since 2018 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to prevent migraines. The antibodies inhibit the action of a neurotransmitter called calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, either by changing the peptide’s shape or attaching to its receptors in the brain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Hayley Gudgin standing in the snow" class="wp-image-3097462" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032721_migrane_inline-2_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097462">Hayley Gudgin suffered years of debilitating migraines. With a CGRP inhibitor, she’s doing better.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097462">Martin Gudgin</span></figure>



<p>The drugs have changed the game for some migraine sufferers. Roughly half of people who took one of the four drugs in clinical trials saw at least a 50 percent reduction in monthly migraines, says neurologist David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, who reported the findings at a Migraine Trust International Symposium in October. About a third of patients had a 75 percent drop in migraine days.</p>



<p>The CGRP-blockers appear to be an improvement over existing preventive treatments, which were developed for other disorders. The newer drugs were designed specifically to target one of the mechanisms that researchers think leads to the painful episodes.</p>



<p>Doctors are embracing the new drugs because they can work better and generally have much fewer side effects than other options. “It’s really beneficial for improving quality of life in our patients with migraines. [The new drugs] don’t cause weight gain, sleepiness, brain fog,” says neurologist Nina Riggins, a headache specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>



<p>And the options for blocking CGRP are expanding. Rimegepant, or Nurtec, is one of several drugs known as gepants that bind to the CGRP receptor. The drug, an oral tablet rather than a shot, was approved as a treatment for acute migraine in February 2020. When taken every other day, rimegepant appears to also <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32544-7/fulltext#seccestitle190">offer some benefit as a preventive</a>, as reported January 2 in the <em>Lancet</em>.</p>



<h4>Nothing typical</h4>



<p>Migraine is the third most common disorder in the world, according to the World Health Organization. Migraines or severe headaches <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912a8.htm">affect more than 15 percent of U.S. adults</a>, striking women twice as often as men, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. In all, more than 39 million Americans get migraine attacks, which can last four to 72 hours.</p>

<h3>A common pain </h3>



<p>Based on U.S. household interviews in 2018, about 1 in 5 women and 1 in 10 men reported having a migraine or severe headache in the previous three months.</p>

</div>



<p>Along with the most common symptom — severe throbbing pain in the head — patients can experience sensitivity to light, smells and sound; dizziness; vomiting; numbness; and visual disturbances such as blind spots and tunnel vision.</p>



<p>“Migraine is probably more than one disease,” says neurologist Richard Lipton of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y. “There are more than 40 identified genes that contribute to the risk of migraine. What that means is that there are multiple pathways that lead to migraine, and as a consequence of that, migraine is not a one-size-fits-all condition.”</p>



<p>Although many genes have been identified as playing a role, researchers have not pinpointed the exact mechanisms involved with migraine. The long-held notion of blood vessel dilation being to blame has even fallen out of favor, says Amaal Starling, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>



<p>“We know pain is caused by … abnormal activity in multiple parts of the brain, including the trigeminal nerve, trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brain stem, and the pain networks,” Starling says. This leads to migraine-related pain in the head, face and neck.</p>



<p>Some theories suggest that migraine occurs — and a cascade starts — when nerve cells in the brain get overexcited and stimulate the trigeminal nerve, which controls movement of the jaw muscle and sensations of touch, pain and temperature in the face. The trigger can be hormonal changes, stress, food, smells, sounds, a visual stimulus or some combination. The first step in the cascade releases CGRP in the brain, which causes transmission of pain signals.</p>



<p>The pain signals trigger an additional release of CGRP and other peptides. These molecules tell the brain to increase the dilation of blood vessels, releasing toxic chemicals. This is why, at least for some people, CGRP may be a big part of the problem.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>The CGRP cascade </h3>



<p>Migraines involve a series of events in the brain that is still not fully understood, but involves activation of the trigeminal nerve and release of a peptide called CGRP, causing pain in the head, face and jaw, plus other symptoms. Researchers have devised three new approaches that help some patients. All block the action of CGRP: monoclonal antibodies (green Ys on image at right) that either block CGRP’s receptor or grab hold of CGRP itself appear to prevent migraines. Other drugs (dark gray oval on image at right) that block the receptor can treat a migraine that’s already started. </p>

<h4>No easy fix</h4>



<p>Treating chronic migraine is often a two-pronged approach: Try to prevent migraine attacks by managing the underlying cause, and stop attacks when they strike.</p>



<p>Part of a long-lasting problem with chronic migraine is that drugs available for prevention were developed for other diseases, such as hypertension, depression and epilepsy. For example, doctors realized that patients with high blood pressure who also had migraines reported fewer migraines after taking beta-blockers. The medicine slows down the heart by blocking the effect of adrenaline, a hormone that speeds up circulation. Similar stories led to the use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antianxiety medications, narcotics and antihistamines.</p>



<p>None of these drugs are without side effects, and they are ineffective for 40 to 50 percent of chronic migraine patients, according to a 2017 analysis of insurance claims data by Dodick and colleagues in <em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0333102416678382">Cephalalgia</a></em>. Within six months of starting four commonly used migraine prevention drugs, 75 percent of patients had stopped using them. The researchers assume, based on other studies, that the main reasons for stopping were side effects and lack of efficacy.</p>



<p>Side effects include weight gain, nausea, brain fog, drowsiness, speech disturbance and lack of concentration. And sometimes the treatments themselves can bring on headaches. “Most of the acute treatments that we use for migraine, if they’re taken too often, cause medication overuse headaches,” Lipton says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Preventing migraine</h3>



<p>People diagnosed with chronic migraine, which means they get a migraine more than 15 days each month, are prescribed preventive drugs that work in various ways in combination with lifestyle changes, including getting more sleep, avoiding certain foods and lowering stress levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-subtle-pale-pink-background-color has-background"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Antidepressants<br /></strong>Work on brain receptors for the neurotransmitter serotonin so that the recep­tors pay less attention to pain signals.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Antiseizure medications</strong><br />Reduce overactive sensory pathways in the brain to help prevent migraine attacks.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beta-blockers</strong><br />Stop blood vessels from dilating.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)</strong><br />Injected into 30–40 places in the forehead, scalp and neck to block neurotransmitters from carrying pain signals from the brain to those areas.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CGRP-blocking monoclonal antibodies and gepants</strong><br />Stop a chain reaction involved in migraine by block­ing CGRP from attaching to receptors in the brain.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
</div>



<h4>Focus on one pathway</h4>



<p>Researchers realized about 20 years ago that CGRP plays a role in migraine. The peptide helps nerve cells communicate with each other. “[CGRP] is very heavily represented in the pathways that are involved in migraine,” Lipton says.</p>



<p>In one study, researchers measured CGRP levels in the blood and found higher levels in people who had migraines than in people who did not. And among those who experienced migraines, CGRP blood levels went up as migraines came on. In a separate study, when an induced migraine attack was effectively treated, CGRP blood levels came down, says Deborah Friedman, a neuro-ophthalmologist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p>



<p>The work led to the creation of the four monoclonal antibodies approved for preventing migraines. One of them, erenumab, the drug that’s helping Gudgin, mimics the shape of CGRP, binding to the CGRP nerve receptor so the CGRP has no place to attach when it arrives at a nerve cell. The other three drugs — galcanezumab (Emgality), fremanezumab (Ajovy) and eptinezumab (Vyepti) — attach to CGRP itself, changing its shape so it can’t fit into the receptor. All four drugs are given as monthly or quarterly injections or intravenous infusions.</p>

<p>These monoclonal antibodies help some patients and produce fewer side effects than existing treatments. In a 2019 survey of nearly 600 people taking galcanezumab to prevent migraines, conducted by the drug’s maker, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, nearly 80 percent reported their migraine as “better” overall since starting the medication. In a study funded by eptinezumab’s manufacturer, H. Lundbeck A/S in Copenhagen, more than 80 percent of about 700 patients <a href="https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-020-01186-3#Fun">reported they had a 50 percent or greater drop in migraine days</a> in at least one four-week interval, and about one-third of patients taking intravenous eptinezumab saw that same drop over the entire 24-week study.</p>



<p>Only 20.5 percent of patients taking a placebo saw the same drop in migraine days, as reported last October in the <em>Journal of Headache and Pain</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p></p><p>“Most of the acute treatments that we use for migraine, if they’re taken too often, cause medication overuse headaches.”</p><cite>Richard Lipton</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The gepants go after the same pathway, but can be taken orally because they are small molecules. Gepants are prescribed on an as-needed basis to stop acute migraines. Recent studies <a href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/head.13791#:~:text=Gepants%20are%20a%20new%20class,may%20have%20benefit%20for%20prevention">suggest they may have preventive benefits too</a>, according to an April 2020 report in <em>Headache</em>.</p>



<p>Gepants have been studied since 2004, but earlier versions caused liver problems, so they never made it to market. In 2019 and 2020, the FDA approved two formulations — ubrogepant, or Ubrelvy, and rimegepant, or Nurtec. Overall, the gepants appear to stop migraine pain within two hours in about 20 percent of patients and do not bring on the overuse headaches that are common with other acute treatments.</p>



<p>Two additional gepants, atogepant and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04346615">zavegepant</a>, are still in patient trials. Atogepant is being evaluated as a preventive, while zavegepant is being looked at as an acute medication.</p>



<p>Lipton and colleagues reported in the <em>Lancet</em> on January 2 the results of a Phase II/III prevention study of rimegepant, funded by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals of New Haven, Conn. Of 348 participants who took the drug every day, 49 percent experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in moderate to severe migraine days each month. But the placebo group did almost as well, with a 41 percent reduction.</p>

<h4>The need for new ideas</h4>



<p>Clearly, this variety of CGRP inhibitors don’t work for everyone. And they cause side effects for some people, including constipation, increased risk for upper respiratory tract infections and injection-site pain.</p>



<p>Amy Chesney, a retired software engineer who lives in Bossier City, La., started getting migraines in 1992, tried three different CGRP drugs and found that they made her depressed and didn’t do anything for her migraines.</p>



<p>There’s also some concern about long-term effects from CGRP monoclonal antibodies, since CGRP exists in the peripheral nervous system as well as the brain. For instance, CGRP causes blood vessels to dilate in a variety of systems including the intestines.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Nurtec tablet package and self-administered injection migraine treatment" class="wp-image-3097554" height="696" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032721_migrane_inline-6_rev.png" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097554">The CGRP-inhibiting drugs, which became available starting in 2018, come in tablets, self-administered injections or infusions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097554">From top: Biohaven Pharmaceuticals; Allison Bailey/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure></div>



<p>Doctors say this is why constipation is one of the drugs’ most common side effects. CGRP is also involved in hair follicles, and some patients have reported hair loss. And CGRP is important to blood vessel health, which is why researchers say it will be important to complete long-term studies to look for cardiac issues, although so far none have surfaced.</p>



<p>Finally, the drugs are expensive and, as Gudgin discovered, insurance companies can make patients and doctors jump through hoops before covering the cost, says Matthew Robbins, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.</p>



<p>When erenumab received FDA approval, its manufacturers, Novartis of Basel, Switzerland, and Amgen of Thousand Oaks, Calif., set a price of $6,900 per year for the drug. “Generally, you can’t just prescribe them straight away. [Patients] have to either not tolerate established medications or [show] that they do not work first,” Robbins says.</p>



<p>It took two denials and three months before Gudgin’s insurance company would approve payment. First, she had to prove that she had tried cheaper preventive medications. Then she had to confirm that she got migraines frequently enough to classify her disease as chronic.</p>



<p>Gudgin says that although her insurance company finally paid for her treatment, she does have a rough time at the beginning of the year when her $4,000 deductible has not yet been met. However, it’s worth it for her, she says, and she would pay out of pocket if she had to. “I’m not stuck in a darkened room. I have a life again. You can’t put a price on that.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-pressure-physics-electricity">Can room-temperature superconductors work without extreme pressure?</a></h4>

<p>For decades, scientists quested after a room-temperature superconductor. Now that they’ve finally found one, the hunt is on for an even better material.</p>



<p>Until last year, all known superconductors — materials that conduct electricity without resistance — had to be cooled, many to extremely low temperatures, making them impractical for use in most electronic devices. In 2020, physicist Ranga Dias and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">a compound of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen</a> was superconducting at room temperature (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). But the need for cooling had been swapped for another impractical requirement: The material had to be crushed to 267 gigapascals, more than 2 million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>Now, scientists are devising strategies to ease the squeeze, perhaps even bringing pressures down to atmospheric levels. “This is what we really want to do,” says Dias, of the University of Rochester in New York.</p>



<p>A superconductor that operates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure could be integrated into a wide variety of electronic devices, enabling improved computers and advanced levitating trains and saving vast amounts of energy in the electrical grid.</p>





<p>But how to find superconductors that operate close to room temperature and require less pressure? “I think this is now the big remaining question in the field,” physicist Lilia Boeri of the Sapienza University of Rome said March 16 at an online meeting of the American Physical Society. During the meeting, several groups of physicists reported making headway.</p>



<h4>Searching for superconductors</h4>



<p>To find the next big superconductor, it helps to know where to start hunting. Scientists are <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/E18.3">using computer calculations</a> to theoretically determine the structures and properties of materials and guide the search, theoretical chemist Eva Zurek said March 16 at the meeting. That strategy has paid off in the past. “Theory has played a very important role, in some cases predicting these structures before they were made,” said Zurek, of the University at Buffalo in New York. For example, such predictions led researchers to a compound of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">lanthanum and hydrogen</a> which was found in 2018 to be superconducting at then record-high temperatures up to about –13° Celsius (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>Now, predictions have guided scientists to <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/S23.10">superconductors made of yttrium and hydrogen</a>, Dias reported March 18 at the APS meeting, in work done in collaboration with Zurek. Superconducting at up to about –11° C, Dias’s yttrium-hydrogen superconductor is one of the highest-temperature superconductors known. While Dias’s carbon, sulfur and hydrogen superconductor is still the temperature record holder, the new material requires a significantly lower pressure — although <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.117003">at 182 gigapascals</a>, it’s still no simple squeeze. Dias and Zurek also reported their results March 19 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>The list of high-temperature record holders is dominated by superconductors rich in hydrogen. Pure hydrogen is expected to become a metal when squeezed, one that would be a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pressure-make-metallic-hydrogen">room-temperature superconductor</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/16</em>). But that metallic hydrogen demands such extreme pressures that it’s proved difficult to create. By adding in another element, such as lanthanum or yttrium, scientists have created superconductors that function similar to the elusive metallic hydrogen, but at lower pressures.</p>



<p>Theoretical calculations have now explored all combinations of hydrogen and any other single element, looking for likely superconductors. The new frontier is calculating combinations of two elements with hydrogen, such as the carbon-sulfur-hydrogen compound that Dias found experimentally. But that task poses an additional challenge: too many pairs of elements to choose from. “It’s just going to explode in our faces, the number of possible combinations,” Zurek says. Still, one study has already suggested this technique will find success in bringing down the pressure.</p>



<h4>Studying new materials</h4>



<p>A <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/E18.1">combination of lanthanum, boron and hydrogen</a> may be superconducting at lower pressures, Boeri and colleagues reported at the meeting and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11227">in a paper</a> posted February 22 at arXiv.org. The chemical structure is similar to that of the 2018 superconductor made of lanthanum and hydrogen, where a cage of hydrogen atoms surrounds a lanthanum atom. In the new compound, boron atoms fill some additional empty space around the cage. That provides an extra chemical pressure, Boeri said, meaning that, if the material were created in the lab, it could retain its superconductivity even when the external pressure is as low as 40 gigapascals. The predicted temperature required is lower, at –147° C, but that’s still relatively warm compared with most superconductors.</p>



<p>“We were actually quite surprised that it would work this way,” Boeri says. Normally, chemists would expect the boron to form bonds with the hydrogen, rather than simply acting to pen in the hydrogen cage. But chemistry under pressure breaks the normal rules.</p>



<p>That’s why calculations are so important in the search for superconductors, says Zurek. Computational methods of searching for new materials under pressure can find structures that normal intuition, based on chemistry at ambient pressure, wouldn’t have conceived of. Databases of chemical structures wouldn’t include these materials, “nor could our chemical imagination have dreamt of them prior to finding them on the computer,” she said.</p>



<p>In his talk, Dias dropped hints about another new material his group has found that is superconducting at room temperature and significantly lower pressure, around 20 gigapascals. But he can’t speak about it yet due to a pending patent application.</p>



<p>Scientists are enthusiastic about the new developments in superconductor research. “This is just the most exciting thing that’s going on at the moment in science,” said physicist Graeme Ackland of the University of Edinburgh, who moderated one of the sessions at the meeting.</p>



<p>Dias envisions a future where hardware store salespeople will ask, “‘You want a superconducting wire or you want normal wires?’” he said. “We want it to get to that level.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oumuamua-interstellar-object-origin-pluto-exoplanet-not-aliens">‘Oumuamua may be a chip knocked off an icy, Pluto-like exoplanet</a></h4>

<p>Since its discovery, the interstellar object known as ‘Oumuamua has defied explanation. First <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/interstellar-asteroid-might-have-just-been-spotted-first-time">spotted in 2017</a>, it has been called an asteroid, a comet and an alien spaceship (<em>SN: 10/27/17</em>). But researchers think they finally have the mystery object pegged: It could be a shard of nitrogen ice <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1718.pdf">broken off a Pluto-like planet</a> orbiting another star.</p>



<p>“The idea is pretty compelling,” says Garrett Levine, an astronomer at Yale University not involved in the work. “It does a really good job of matching the observations.”</p>



<p>‘Oumuamua’s origin has been a mystery because it looks <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/our-first-interstellar-visitor-may-be-camouflaged-comet">sort of like a comet, but not quite</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/17</em>). After whipping by the sun, ‘Oumuamua zoomed away slightly faster than gravity alone would allow. That happens when ices on the sunlit sides of comets vaporize, giving them a little rocketlike boost in speed. But unlike comets, ‘Oumuamua didn’t appear to have a tail from typical cometary ices, such as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, streaming off it.</p>



<p>Alan Jackson and Steven Desch, planetary scientists at Arizona State University in Tempe, set out to discover what other kind of evaporating ice could give ‘Oumuamua a big enough nudge to explain its movement. The pair reported their results March 17 at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and in two studies published online March 16 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>.</p>





<p>The amount of force that a vaporizing ice exerts on a comet depends on factors such as how much the ice heats up when it absorbs energy, the mass of its molecules and even the ice’s crystal structure. By calculating the rocketlike push on ‘Oumuamua if it were made of ices such as nitrogen, hydrogen and water, “we learned that nitrogen ice would work perfectly well,” Desch says.</p>



<p>Because nitrogen ice covers outer solar system bodies such as Pluto and Neptune’s moon Triton, but not smaller objects like comets, ‘Oumuamua is probably <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JE006706">a chip off a Pluto-like exoplanet</a>, the researchers report.</p>



<p>To determine how realistic that scenario is, Jackson and Desch calculated how many chunks of nitrogen ice could have been knocked off Pluto-like bodies in the early solar system. Back then, the Kuiper Belt of objects beyond Neptune was much more crowded than it is today, including thousands of Pluto-like bodies iced with nitrogen. But some 4 billion years ago, Neptune’s orbit expanded. That disruption caused many Kuiper Belt objects to collide with each other, and most sailed out of the solar system altogether.</p>



<p>Under such chaotic conditions, collisions could have broken <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JE006807">trillions of nitrogen ice fragments</a> off Pluto-like bodies, Jackson and Desch estimate. If other planetary systems throw out as many shards of ice, those objects could make up about 4 percent of the bodies in interstellar space. That would make seeing an object like ‘Oumuamua mildly unusual but not exceptional, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“When I first started reading it, I was skeptical … but it does tick a lot of the necessary boxes,” says Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. not involved in the work. “It’s definitely plausible that this could be a fragment of an icy dwarf planet.” But plausible, he notes, does not necessarily mean correct.</p>



<p>‘Oumuamua is now too far away to confirm this idea with more observations. But the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and European Space Agency’s Comet Interceptor mission could detect more interstellar objects, says Yun Zhang, a planetary scientist at Côte d’Azur Observatory in Nice, France, not involved in the research. The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to spot, on average, one interstellar visitor per year, and the Comet Interceptor spacecraft may actually visit one.</p>



<p>Getting a closer look at more of these objects could narrow down which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/explanations-oumuamua-not-alien-spaceships">possible explanations</a> for ‘Oumuamua are most reasonable, she says (<em>SN: 2/27/19</em>).</p>

<p>With the slightest touch, the fernlike vine known as sleeping grass folds over on itself, like a Venus flytrap closing its flaps. “What causes the leaves to close when you touch them?” a young Jennifer Doudna wondered growing up in Hawaii. Noticing that curiosity, Doudna’s father left James Watson’s book <em>The Double Helix</em> on her bed one day. Doudna sped through the pages, absorbing how Watson and Francis Crick deciphered the structure of DNA. Today, she credits the book and her insatiable inquisitiveness for driving her to become a scientist and for setting the foundation for her to codiscover, nearly four decades later, a set of molecular scissors called CRISPR that can edit the genetic blueprint of life. Watson would later call CRISPR “the most important discovery since DNA’s structure,” Walter Isaacson writes in <em>The Code Breaker</em>.</p>



<p>The book, both a biography of Doudna and a deep dive into the ethics of genetic engineering, is written for people who may have heard of CRISPR but don’t know much about the history of its development. The book digs into the fierce patent battles that have ensued between the University of California (Doudna is at the Berkeley campus) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where other researchers, most notably Feng Zhang, were also developing the gene-editing tool. The tone and style of the book’s first half mimic <em>The Double Helix</em>, setting up the scientific process as a detective story, one focused first on understanding how bacteria rely on CRISPR to fend off viral infections and then on how scientists transformed that natural bacterial defense system into a tool that allows humans to edit their own DNA.</p>





<p>While <em>The Code Breaker</em> starts off as a page-turner, the latter half is more tedious, with tangents that loosely weave together the battle over the claim to discovering CRISPR and the ethical questions around using it. Those questions came to the fore in 2018, after the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-scientists-raise-ethical-questions-first-crispr-gene-edited-babies">birth of two babies whose genes had been edited</a> while still embryos (<em>SN: 11/27/18</em>). Impressively timely, Isaacson bounces from concerns over “designer” children to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">Doudna’s shared 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>) to her latest race against rivals: adapting CRISPR into a tool that can quickly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus">detect the virus that causes COVID-19</a>, or one that could potentially thwart the virus’s infection of human cells (<em>SN: 8/31/20</em>). No longer is the race for patents and prizes, Isaacson writes, but one to save humankind from the coronavirus and possibly other ills. </p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Researchers have used virtual reality to explore how art and nature elicit feelings of the sublime. </strong>The team compared people’s emotional responses when they saw a 360° VR version of Van Gogh’s <em>The Starry Night</em> to when they saw a realistic portrayal of the actual area depicted in the painting. They found that both VR videos induced sublime feelings — but participants’ responses were more intense for the naturalistic video, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/quantifying-the-sublime-with-vr">reports Sarah Wells</a> at <em>Inverse</em>.</p>

<p><strong>More on dolphin psychology this week: researchers have found that the marine creatures co-ordinate behaviour through vocal cues.</strong> Dolphins appear to use clicks to synchronise their jumps, for instance, while in another study, two dolphins who had to press buttons simultaneously to get a treat used whistles to co-ordinate. But not everyone is convinced that these are examples of intentional communication, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/watch-dolphins-talk-each-other-synchronize-their-behaviors">as Christa Lesté-Lasserre reports</a> at <em>Science</em>.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts">AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine isn’t tied to blood clots, experts say</a></h4>

<p>AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine is <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots">not associated with an increased risk of blood clots</a>, the European Medicines Agency announced March 18. That’s the conclusion of an investigation conducted by an EMA safety committee into reports of blood clots in some vaccinated people.</p>



<p>“This vaccine is a safe and effective option to protect citizens against COVID-19,” Emer Cooke, executive director of the EMA said March 18 in a news conference.</p>



<p>Starting March 11, many countries, mostly in Europe, began suspending use of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford because of concerns it could be linked to blood clots. Of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and the United Kingdom, there were around 470 reports of blood clots in the days after getting the shot. That rate is lower than how often people normally develop blood clots in daily life, Sabine Straus, chair of the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, said during the news conference.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>But some uncertainties remain over a few rare case reports, Straus said. Eighteen patients who received the vaccine developed blood clots in the sinuses that drain blood from the brain, a potentially deadly condition called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Another seven people developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC, in which blood clots can develop throughout the body and block small blood vessels. Nine people died. But there were not enough data to conclude whether these cases might be related to the vaccine, Straus said.</p>



<p>Based on data from before the pandemic, fewer than <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots">one DIC case might be expected by March 16 in people younger than 50</a> years old within two weeks of getting the vaccine, the agency said in a press release. The EMA committee, however, reviewed five such cases. There might also be 1.35 cases of sinus clots on average in that age group, but countries reported 12 by March 16.</p>



<p>Even in light of the reports, “I think the risk is worth taking,” says Elliott Haut, a blood clot expert and trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Half a million people died in the United States from [COVID-19] — you don’t want to get this disease.”</p>



<p>The EMA committee will continue to monitor any additional cases of DIC or blood clots in the brain’s sinuses. The agency also recommends that AstraZeneca add a warning to the information provided to physicians and to patients who receive the vaccine to raise awareness.</p>



<p>It’s still unclear why some patients might develop blood clots after vaccination. One possibility is that some vaccinated people might have previously had COVID-19, which can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-dangerous-blood-clots">cause blood clots</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/20</em>).</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>The EMA committee’s review found that DIC or brain blood clots were more common in women, particularly younger women. It’s too early to know for sure, however, because there is not enough data to rule out other explanations, Straus said. The risk of blood clots may be higher in that group in general — such as women on birth control — or it could be that more women have been vaccinated than men.  </p>



<p>But the pattern might also be coincidence, particularly for the reports of less dangerous blood clots. “Blood clots are super common,” Haut says. “It’d be very different for a very uncommon disease to be starting to pop up. Then I think I’d be a little more concerned.”  </p>



<p>AstraZeneca previously announced in a news release March 14 that a review of safety data from more than 17 million vaccinated people, the same used in the EMA’s analysis, revealed <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-on-the-safety-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca.html">no connection to blood clots</a>.</p>



<p>The World Health Organization also investigated reports of blood clots after vaccination with AstraZeneca’s jab and similarly concluded that the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/19-03-2021-statement-of-the-who-global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety-(gacvs)-covid-19-subcommittee-on-safety-signals-related-to-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine">benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk</a>, according to a March 19 statement. “In extensive vaccination campaigns, it is routine for countries to signal potential adverse events following immunization,” the health agency said in a statement March 17. “This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them.”</p>



<p>The shot is not yet authorized for use in the United States.</p>

<p>Thirty million years before manta rays began gracefully gliding through ocean waters, a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abc1490">shark with fantastically elongated fins</a> gave such underwater flight a go, researchers report in the March 19 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>A quarry worker unearthed the fossil of the strange shark, now dubbed <em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>, in 2012 from a rock layer in northeastern Mexico dating to about 93 million years ago. The shark’s most distinctive feature is the long curving fins that swoop out from its sides. Spanning nearly 2 meters from tip to tip, the fins’ length rivals the wingspan of bald eagles. Nicknamed eagle shark by researchers, <em>A. milarcae</em> may have used the fins to stabilize itself or propel itself in a manta ray–like fashion.</p>



<p>The eagle shark’s broad, rounded head, long jaws and small teeth hint that it may have been a filter feeder, sucking in floating plankton from seawater. Its torpedo-shaped body and high tail fin suggest the shark was an active swimmer, although not a particularly fast one, say vertebrate paleontologist Romain Vullo of the University of Rennes in France and colleagues.</p>



<p><em>A. milarcae</em> may have been a member of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">a highly diverse group of sharks</a> that includes extinct megalodons as well as modern great whites and filter-feeding basking sharks (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>). Although that group once dominated the seas, many of its members became extinct after an asteroid struck Earth about 66 million years ago.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em>Dan Carney</p>



<p>Research into emotion processing in autistic people has mainly focused on how they understand others’ emotions. A more limited body of work into how autistic people process their own emotions has, however, suggested difficulties identifying and describing emotional experiences, and distinguishing between emotional states. The latter is potentially important, as it is associated with negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and self-injurious behavior, all of which have been suggested to occur more frequently in autism than in the general population.   </p>



<p>So far, studies of emotion differentiation in autism have tended to use language-based tasks. But now, a team led by Eleanor Palser from the University of California San Francisco has reported <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320987950">the first study</a> looking at how autistic children map out where they feel emotions in their body. The team finds that compared to non-autistic children, the bodily emotion maps of autistic children are more similar across different emotions, suggesting less variability in the way they physically experience different emotional states. The research, published in the journal <em>Autism</em>, was partly based on a 2016 report from the charity Autistica, in which members of the autistic community identified sensory processing and affective difficulties as key research goals.</p>



<span id="more-41592"></span>



<p>A key aspect of emotional experience is the bodily sensation and change brought about by different emotions (e.g. sweaty palms when nervous, heart pounding when excited). Researchers have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/08/a-cartography-of-consciousness-researchers-map-where-subjective-feelings-are-located-in-the-body/">created detailed bodily maps</a> of the regions and sensations associated with different emotional states, but no one had directly studied how — and where — autistic people experience emotion in their bodies.<br /><br />In the new study, the researchers asked autistic and non-autistic children and adolescents to produce body maps of various emotions using a pen-and-paper version of the emBODY emotion colouring task. The participants were asked to recall experiencing a particular emotion, then colour areas of stronger or faster resultant activity on one bodily outline, and those of weaker or slower activity on another. Six emotions — anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, and disgust — were presented in a randomised order.</p>



<p>The team also used two tasks to measure interoception, one’s own awareness of internal bodily responses. <em>Interoceptive sensibility</em>, participants’ perceptions of their own interoception abilities, was assessed by asking them to indicate how often they feel common bodily sensations (e.g. goose bumps or stomach noises). A more objective measure of <em>interoceptive accuracy</em> was provided by examining how accurate participants were at a heartbeat-counting task.</p>



<p>On the colouring task, autistic participants showed less variability across emotions, with regard to the head, heart, and hands. In other words, they were more likely than non-autistic participants to colour these areas similarly, regardless of the emotion they were recalling.</p>

<p>Interestingly (and although the autistic group showed a lower level of interoceptive sensibility), these differences were not associated with interoceptive performance. This suggests that the bodily mapping task may tap into other aspects of emotion processing beyond simply the detection of one’s own physiological changes.</p>



<p>The researchers also speculate that the reduced emotion differentiation in the autistic group may — even on a relatively non-linguistic colouring task — still have been affected by the difficulties with emotion-based language that many autistic people experience, rather than interoceptive problems.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the fact that this task involved the recall of emotional events raises the possibility that episodic memory deficits may have played a role. The authors suggest that interventions focused on increasing children’s emotion word knowledge, or improving their memory of emotional events, may help to increase emotion differentiation. This is important because less variation in how people experience emotions has been linked to anxiety and depression, challenges which autistic people are more likely to experience.</p>



<p>Overall, this study offers the first indication that some autistic people may experience less variation in their physiological emotional responses. Given that this may not be fully explained by interoceptive difficulties, future work could investigate other skills involved in distinguishing between the bodily sensations associated with different emotions. Studies could also examine these abilities in other populations, to establish to what extent patterns may differ between groups.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper "How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SoB1zL-x4PY/">Open Response to “Economic impact of UKRI open access policy” report</a></h4>

<p>On February 17, 2021, FTI Consulting released the report: “<a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FTI-Report-for-Publishers-Association-1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Economic assessment of the impact of the new Open Access policy developed by UK Research and Innovation</a>” (full title) prepared for the <a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Publisher’s Association</a> (PA) of the UK.  While we are not setting out to provide an extensive review and analysis of this report, we do want to generally refute the assertion that OA via the UKRI policy is economically damaging, and we’ll provide some references that support this position.</p>



<h4>Open Access and Open Research are an opportunity</h4>



<p>The FTI/PA report asserts that the impact of the new UKRI policy could lead to a loss in revenue to “UK-based journals” and have a broader negative impact on UK competitiveness, economic growth and position as a “global research hub.” This assessment appears to use impact on traditional publication models as the basis for this conclusion. A problem here, however, is that it is considering the scholarly publishing industry as somehow separate from the broader economic impact of making research open. Previous <a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/publications/publishings-contribution-to-research-and-innovation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reports </a>from the PA itself have shown that the link to the economy is much broader than this depiction. The UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap/uk-research-and-development-roadmap" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">R&amp;D roadmap</a> clearly embraces open research and rapid open dissemination as not just good for science and health (especially during the current pandemic) but as a core part of “a world-leading system that unlocks innovation and growth throughout all parts of the economy.” Open Access enables this entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. When coupled with Open Research, it brings the additional benefits of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913039116" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">increasing trust in science</a>, ever more important during these difficult times. </p>



<p>Open Research (of which Open Access is one part) offers even greater opportunity both in terms of discovery and economic growth. For example, the European Data Portal’s <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/the-economic-impact-of-open-data.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report </a>on the economic impact of open data identifies the potential for 15.7% growth across a range of sectors – including scientific &amp; technical, communication, transport, finance, health, retail and agriculture – and significant cost savings across the economy. We believe that a focus on Open Research, and all the efficiencies it brings, is worth considering for the UK economy especially in light of the combined impacts of the pandemic and Brexit (whatever one’s position on Brexit is).</p>



<p>Furthermore, Open Access is the fastest growing publishing model. A recent report from the scholarly analytics firm, <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dimensions</a>, shows that “in <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/blog/open-access-surpasses-subscription-publication-globally-for-the-first-time/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2020 […]more outputs were published through Open Access channels than traditional subscription channels globally</a>.” The report further show that the majority of the growth in OA is fueled by Gold OA, i.e. OA supported by some kind of business or sustainability model. It is ever more futile, in our opinion, to take such a critical and isolated position against UKRI policy when one can argue that OA is an outcome that will simply continue to happen. It is far more beneficial, as the policy itself proposes, to establish the UK as an early adopter, leader, and beneficiary of OA and its opportunities. </p>



<h4>Publishers can and should lead</h4>



<p>The benefits of OA, the opportunities created by OA, and the desire for OA by the public and funders like UKRI, are clear. Contrary to Section 4.44 of the report, which mischaracterizes PLOS as publishing “at cost”, it is entirely possible to maintain value for authors, funders, and  institutions while operating a sustainable, surplus-generating business model. PLOS believes that publishers globally should be leading the efforts to devise and develop the next generation of business models that are able to support their operations in an Open Access context. This will, of course, require deep, and sometimes difficult, work by transitioning publishers. But we strongly believe this work is not outside the acceptable effort level of conscientious members of the scholarly publishing industry that have been aware of Open Access, and its benefits, for at least the last 20 years. </p>



<p>We would like to thank the UKRI for its efforts to hear from stakeholders in the scholarly  publishing community, and beyond, regarding the proposed policy. We understand it is a discussion rife with passionate viewpoints and unseen complexities, and so we would like to ensure that one point is clear: to successfully set up the most efficient,  frictionless Open Access ecosystem, we should leverage the <em>existing </em>budgets and infrastructures of scholarly publishing but with OA as the outcome. This way, Open Access is not viewed as a destructive force, or something external and different that traditional publishers are not part of, but simply as the new way to publish and communicate research that all publishers can facilitate. </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Hearing voices is often associated with mental illness. But this belief doesn’t always reflect reality, with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-and-cognitive-psychotherapy/article/abs/hearing-voices-in-a-nonpsychiatric-population/1E67D977F6096FA5DBA2B84D0582C460">much</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240854/">research</a> suggesting that many people who hear voices experience no distress and have never had contact with psychiatric services. <em>Religious</em> hearing of voices also has a tradition outside of what we might consider “pathological”: St. Augustine’s recognition of the voice of God, to use one very famous example.</p>



<p>Why do some of us hear otherworldly voices, while others don’t? According to Stanford University’s Tanya Marie Luhrmann and team, it could be related to two factors: “absorption” and “porosity”, both of which concern our beliefs and experiences about how the mind interacts with the world. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2016649118">In a study in <em>PNAS </em></a>that spanned a range of faiths and cultures, the team examined exactly how porosity and absorption can facilitate different kinds of spiritual experience.</p>



<span id="more-41579"></span>



<p>“Porosity” refers to the view that the boundary between the mind and the world is permeable — that emotions “linger in a room”, or that some people can read minds. Porous views tend to be contrasted with the more secular idea that the mind is a discrete space, separate from the world. “Absorption”, on the other hand, is the tendency to be engrossed in sensory or imagined events — being able to “lose yourself” in music, films, or nature, for example.</p>



<p>The researchers looked at how these two factors were related to spiritual experiences among participants from the US, Ghana, Thailand, Vanuatu and China. Religions ranged from evangelical Christianity to Methodism to Buddhism to ancient practices found in Vanuatu.</p>



<p>The first study saw 300 adults with strong religious beliefs, either evangelical Christianity or a locally relevant religion, take part in two in-depth interviews conducted by on-site fieldworkers in churches, shrines and temples. One explored their experience of events in which they had felt a spiritual presence, and the other looked at how they understood and thought about the mind.</p>



<p>In the second interview, researchers probed belief in both porosity and absorption. Participants were presented with brief stories, each with different implications for the boundary between the mind and the world, and indicated how much they believed such an event could happen (e.g. the likelihood of someone becoming physically unwell because of a friend being angry with them). For absorption, participants indicated how much they agreed with statements such as “when I listen to music I can get so caught up in it that I don’t notice anything else”.</p>



<p>The second study replicated these methods with 766 adults from the general population in each country and 236 evangelical Christians, who were also asked how much they agreed with specific statements related to porosity (e.g. “spirits can read our thoughts and act on them even if we don’t speak them out loud”).</p>



<p>Interviews in both studies prompted stories about sensory experiences of otherworldly beings. Christian participants reported feeling the presence of god, whilst one Thai Buddhist participant, a nurse, told of an experience in which she calmly saw ghostly figures in the hospital where she worked. And while experiences differed across cultures, porosity and absorption were clear predictors of experiences of spiritual presence in different religions. </p>



<p>In the final study, 505 participants from each country, who were all based in cities, completed the two measures of porosity, the absorption scale, and the two measures of spiritual presence events used in previous studies. They also completed two measures of “secular” or non-spiritual hallucination-like experiences (responding to questions such as “I hear the telephone ring and find that I am mistaken”) and the paranormal (e.g. “I am completely convinced that it is [impossible/possible] to send a “mental message” to another person”).</p>



<p>Again, higher levels of absorption and porosity predicted experience of spiritual events. Interestingly, this was also the case for <em>secular</em> events — hearing the phone ring, for example, or hearing music when it’s not being played — suggesting that porosity and absorption may have an impact on unusual sensory experiences even outside of religious contexts.</p>



<p>The results add further evidence for the need for openness around unusual sensory experiences. Both secular and religious experiences were recorded during the course of the study, with many participants not only unafraid but actively peaceful or calm, as in the example of the Thai Buddhist nurse. Christian participants also talked about the comforting presence of God.</p>



<p>The study suggests that unusual sensory experiences are common even among those who do not suffer from mental illness. But perhaps studies like this, which broaden our understanding of the nature and frequency of unusual sensory experiences, could also help break down the stigma of disorders in which such experiences often occur.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We all have times when we feel that we’ve failed — but it’s how we respond to it that really matters. Here are five findings that could help you cope with failure:</p>



<span id="more-41571"></span>



<p><strong>1. Be kind to yourself</strong></p>



<p>It’s an old one, but a good one: practise some self-compassion. Being self-compassionate entails being kind and non-judgemental towards yourself in the face of difficulty — including failure. Perhaps the best-known <a href="https://self-compassion.org">proponent of self-compassion is Kristin Neff </a>at the University of Texas, Austin (you can <a href="https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/">take her self-compassion test here</a>). <a href="https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/SClearninggoals.pdf">Back in 2005</a>, Neff published work finding that students who are self-compassionate in the wake of exam failure go on to study harder for future exams. More recent work has found that being kind to yourself if you feel that you’ve failed at something (and recognising that you’re far from alone in failing) is linked with better mental health. And self-compassion is even linked to greater physical health too, according to a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8183-1">recent study</a> in <em>BMC Public Health</em>.</p>



<p><strong>2. Resist “socially prescribed perfectionism”</strong></p>



<p>If you feel that other people expect you to be perfect, and will judge you harshly if you fail to meet their expectations, you experience this type of perfectionism. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735816302902?via=ihub">major 2017 review</a> of work into factors that foster resilience after failure or mistakes highlighted it as a clear risk factor: people who scored higher on this measure experienced more anxiety, depression and anger after being led to fail at a task. Interventions aimed at improving wellbeing and resilience should target this factor, the researchers concluded. Exactly how to go about this is another matter, of course. There is <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02703/full">some evidence that exposure to contrasting messages</a> — some anti-perfectionism, others in favour of it — helps to tackle this type of perfectionism. But for an individual, it could be worth resisting the urge to think about how other people might judge you after a failure.</p>



<p><strong>3. Don’t worry too much if you were over-confident — and wrong</strong></p>



<p>Overconfidence is not a good thing; it leads us to study less hard and make more mistakes. But let’s say you take an exam or test feeling convinced that you’re on top of the material and are getting pretty much everything right, only to receive a poor grade. Your initial confidence was clearly misplaced. No doubt, it was at least partly responsible for your failure. However, there’s plenty of evidence that the surer you are about an answer that turns out to be wrong and is corrected, the better you’ll remember the correct answer and use it in future. This, at least, was one of the conclusions of <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022">a 2017 review</a> of work on learning from errors by Janet Metcalfe at Columbia University. “A strong degree of belief in the truth of one’s errors makes them more, rather than less, susceptible to being correctable,” Metcalfe writes. However….</p>



<p><strong>4. Try not to take evidence of failure too personally</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619881133">recent set of studies</a> on almost 1,700 American participants, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, found that feedback on what they had got wrong on a variety of tests or tasks rather than what they had got right — a “failure focus” rather than a “success focus” — undermined subsequent learning. (These participants’ confidence in their answers was not assessed.) Why? The researchers, at the University of Chicago, think that because personal failure feedback can threaten a person’s self-image, it leads them to tune out. However, participants did learn effectively from other people’s failures — when their ego concerns would have been “muted”. Perhaps encouraging people to reappraise feedback in less ego-threatening terms might help them to learn better from failure, the team suggests. However, as they also note, people in some countries — like Japan — persist for longer at a task after failing at it than after being successful, but this pattern is reversed for Americans. So culture clearly has a huge influence on the impact of failure.</p>



<p><strong>5. Embrace “productive failure”</strong></p>



<p>The idea here is that instead of carefully teaching people how to do something, you let them loose on a new task with only the minimum of guidance. As Sunita G. Chowrira at the University of British Columbia and her colleagues explain in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0040-6">a recent paper</a>, “While students often fail to produce satisfactory solutions (hence ‘Failure’), these attempts help learners encode key features and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence ‘Productive’).” </p>



<p>Productive failure has been found to have benefits in all kinds of teaching situations, including classrooms. In this particular study, Chowrira and her team divided first year biology students into two groups. One received standard instruction on various topics. The other group read a relevant chapter prior to the class, then embarked on challenges in small groups. They received feedback immediately afterwards, followed by instruction on any gaps in their understanding. This second group went on to do better at subsequent exams, and this was especially true for low-performing students. A productive failure approach “has the potential to transform large introductory university courses,” the team concluded. For an individual, there are lessons, too: those people who prefer to throw themselves at a new task rather than carefully reading the instructions first may well “fail” more (and anyone who’s ever tried this approach with a piece of flatpack furniture knows how bad that can be), but learn more and do better next time.</p>

Differences May Be Less Clear Cut Than Often Claimed</a></h4>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The idea that political conservatives and liberals differ in fundamental ways — in their biology and neurology, personality and moral foundations — has received a good deal of attention. However, cracks have begun to appear in this idea. In 2019, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/27/no-conservatives-dont-experience-feelings-of-disgust-any-more-than-liberals/">we covered new work</a> finding that conservatives are not in fact more readily disgusted than liberals (disgust has a moral dimension, of course). And the year before, Jesse Singal, a regular <em>Digest </em>guest blogger, <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/how-social-science-might-be-misunderstanding-conservatives.html">covered evidence suggesting that claims about liberal-conservative personality differences have been overblown</a>.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-82672-001">major new review and meta-analysis</a> of research into political orientation and moral foundations — essentially, how people view morality — calls into question some influential earlier conclusions. Writing in the <em>Psychological Bulletin, </em>J. Matias Kivikangas at Aalto University and colleagues report finding support for the idea of some basic moral differences between conservatives and liberals. However, they also conclude that the differences are less clear cut than had been thought, and the results are also less generalisable across regions, countries and political cultures than has been claimed.  </p>



<span id="more-41565"></span>



<p>The team considered study data from 89 samples, with 605 effect sizes. In total, these studies included almost 44,000 participants who had been directly recruited as well as around 193,000 participants who had chosen to complete surveys on the <a href="https://yourmorals.org">YourMorals.org</a> website (widely used as a data source in this field). In each case, participants had rated their own political orientation on “liberal to conservative” or “left to right” scales, or on social or economic dimensions. They had also reported on their moral foundations using the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-01014-001">Moral Foundations Questionnaire</a>. This questionnaire assesses the degree to which people prioritise five domains in moral decision-making: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect and purity/sanctity. </p>



<p>First, the researchers looked at evidence for the influential idea that, compared with liberals, conservatives endorse the moral foundations of care and fairness less, and loyalty, authority and sanctity more. They found that this claim was generally upheld by the data. However, when they looked more closely, they found that conservative women were about as care-oriented as liberal women (it was conservative men who accounted for the link between conservatism and reduced endorsement of care as a moral foundation). Also, comparisons based on the YourMorals data produced around <em>double </em>the effect sizes of studies that used independent samples. The team adds that “the consistency across the independent studies makes the estimates from the YourMorals dataset suspect”. People who choose to fill in surveys on this website probably do so because they are especially interested in the topic, are more open to experience (a personality trait associated more with liberalism than conservatism) and espouse more extreme beliefs than average — a self-selection that means their attitudes are not representative of the general population.</p>



<p>The team also looked at the claim that moral differences between liberals and conservatives are universal, cutting across geography and culture. They found that this was not the case. In fact: “The association of moral foundations to political orientation varies culturally (between regions and countries) and subculturally (between White and Black respondents and in response to political interest).” For example, among subsamples of Black Americans taken from representative data sets, there was only a very weak association between conservatism and greater endorsement of sanctity and authority.</p>



<p>The researchers also note that while conservatism is often viewed as one-dimensional in the US, in Western Europe, for example, it is generally thought of as having two dimensions: economic and  social. The team found that liberal/conservative variations in endorsement of care and fairness were more related to economic conservatism — and sanctity less so. Yet many studies use single “conservative-liberal” or “left-right” scales, which doesn’t allow for such nuanced conclusions. In fact, views on the meaning of “right-leaning” vary geographically, too; the team <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/bjposi/v49y2019i03p1045-1069_00.html">cites a study</a> finding that in many countries conservatism is more commonly associated with the left and liberalism with the right (something that they note is very clearly the case in Latvia and other formerly communist nations, for example).</p>



<p>“In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis both confirm and expand the relations of moral foundations and political orientation,” the team writes. However, they “also raise some notable considerations for future studies regarding the methodology and theory”.</p>

<p>arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.</p>
<p>arXiv now offers the following name change options:</p>
<ol>
<li>In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address</li>
<li>In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions</li>
<li>In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed</li>
</ol>
<p>We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.</p>
<p>arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2020">gender pay gap is narrowing in the UK</a>, it still remains. It’s vital, then, to fully understand what causes it — and so what can be done to ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the same work. Research does show that women are less likely than men to initiate salary negotiations, and also ask for less. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965544">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> reveals that a gender gap in negotiation emerges surprisingly early, becoming apparent among children aged just eight to nine. This implies that efforts to close the gender pay gap should start long before anyone even enters the workforce. </p>



<span id="more-41479"></span>



<p>Sophie Arnold at Boston College and Katherine McAuliffe at New York University studied 240 boys and girls who lived in the Boston area. The children fell into three age groups: 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and 8 to 9. They each completed a simple task, after which an experimenter — either a man or a woman — told them that they could pick from sets of stickers as a reward. Each child was asked: ‘How many stickers do you think you should get for completing the game you just played?’</p>



<p>If the child asked for two or fewer, they were given this number. But if they asked for more than two, the experimenter told them that they were asking for too many and repeated the question. If the child again asked for more than two, they moved to the next negotiation stage. (Of the initial 240 children, 154 — equal numbers boys and girls — reached this stage.)</p>



<p>In this next stage, the kids were told that if they now asked for more stickers than the experimenter could give them, they wouldn’t get any; however, if they asked for the number of stickers that could be handed over, or fewer, they would receive that number. “These rules were introduced to reflect the risk inherent in negotiations, in which the evaluator has all the power to accept or reject an offer,” the researchers write. These children were then asked again how many stickers they thought they should get. If they asked for more than two they were told that only fewer than three stickers could be given. Whatever number they asked for next, the negotiation ended.</p>



<p>Arnold and McAuliffe found that for 8 to 9 year old girls (but not the younger ones), the number of stickers that they initially asked for was lower if the evaluator was male than if the experimenter was female. For the boys, though, neither their age nor the gender of the evaluator affected their initial requests.</p>



<p>The team also looked at how persistent the children were in asking for a relatively high number of stickers. “How long a person continues to ask for a greater bonus could also perpetuate gender differences in outcomes from negotiations,” the researchers note. In fact, they found a similar pattern: the persistence of the older girls (but not the boys) was lower when their evaluator was male. “Our study is the first to show that gender differences in negotiation emerge in childhood,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>So what might explain these early gender differences? It might be that the older girls have acquired the perception that they have a relatively low status, and the male investigator a higher status, the researchers suggest. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/">Stereotypes that boys are naturally more brilliant and competent could also play a role</a>.</p>



<p>“Much attention has been devoted to explaining and closing the gender pay gap, yet these efforts focus almost exclusively on adults,” the researchers note. “Our findings suggest that these efforts should start earlier in development, as early as elementary school.” The next step, of course, is to map out what these efforts should entail, and testing how well they work. However, even if some gender differences in negotiation do help to explain the gender pay gap, other factors are certainly involved, and the onus should be not on employees, but rather employers, to ensure that it closes.  </p>

This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the <em>International Society of Nephrology</em> and the I<em>nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations</em> with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.</p>
<p>Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.</p>
<p>Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.</p></blockquote>
<p>This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bbDdYlM7-W8/">A Farewell to ALM, but not to article-level metrics!</a></h4>

<p>Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS</p>



<p>Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is <a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">defined</a> by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. </p>



<p>PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.</p>



<p>In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.</p>



<p>In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. </p>



<p>One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Altmetric</a>.</p>



<p>Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.</p>



<p>Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. </p>



<p>Beginning today, the data displayed on the “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metrics</a>” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Altmetric’s media coverage</a>. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">details page</a>, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. </p>



<p>As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely. Unfortunately, our articles will no longer display PMC usage counts, as these were aggregated by ALM and will no longer be available. We will also be removing recent tweets from articles and retiring the ALM Reports service.</p>



<p>Moving forward we will continue to evaluate the presentation of metrics on our articles and look for ways to integrate even more relevant data from Altmetric into our user experience.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Whether you believe in such a thing as “pure evil” — that there are individuals inherently predisposed to intentionally harming others — can fundamentally change how you see the world. Strong belief in pure evil, for example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/15/things-you-might-want-to-know-about-people-who-believe-in-pure-evil/">has been linked to</a> increased support for the death penalty, torture, and racial prejudice.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3795?af=R?saml_referrer">new study</a>, published in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, has looked at the link between belief in pure evil and the attributes we ascribe to perpetrators of violence. Focusing on mass shootings in the US, the team once again finds a relationship between belief in pure evil and harsher approaches to punishment.</p>



<span id="more-41513"></span>



<p>Participants were randomly assigned to read one of four articles from <em>USA Today</em>, all of which they believed were real, about a mass shooting at a shopping mall. Two of these articles mentioned that the shooter had a brain tumour, and contained a fictitious quote from a neuroscientist explaining how the tumour may have affected the shooter’s behaviour. The other two noted that the perpetrator’s brain scan looked normal.</p>



<p>The articles also differed in how the shooter’s behaviour and traits were described. In the “stereotypically evil” condition, the shooter stated that they had enjoyed the act, while a quote from a security guard described the perpetrator as “smiling, smug… like he got some thrill out of doing it”. In the “non-stereotypically evil” condition the security guard described the shooter as seeming “distressed” by his actions.</p>



<p>After reading the article, participants wrote a small passage explaining why they felt the shooter had perpetrated his crimes. They then rated how confident they were that his actions were caused by his personality, or by environmental factors; that he was in control; that his actions were deliberate; and that he should be blamed or held responsible for his actions. Participants also completed a measure of dehumanisation (responding to statements like “The perpetrator is emotionless”).</p>



<p>They then provided their recommendation for different types of punishment (e.g. community service or the death penalty), and indicated how long they felt the perpetrator should be in prison for, or whether or not they should be executed. Finally, participants completed a scale measuring their belief in pure evil.</p>



<p>People with higher levels of belief in pure evil were far more confident about the reasons for the shooter’s actions, and were more likely to attribute his behaviour to his personality. These participants were also more likely to advocate for harsher punishments, up to and including the death penalty. The analysis also suggested that those who believed in pure evil punished the perpetrator more <em>because</em> they felt he was personally liable, because they had dehumanised him, and because they felt greater levels of retribution.</p>



<p>Overall, participants in the stereotypically evil condition were also more likely to ascribe the act of violence to personality than to environmental factors. Those who read that the shooter had a tumour, on the other hand, advocated for lower levels of punishment and were less likely to blame personal factors. However, people who believed in pure evil tended to support harsh punishment whether or not they read that the perpetrator had a tumour, suggesting that believers in pure evil are generally unmoved by these sorts of considerations.</p>



<p>The team notes that the direction of causality between belief in pure evil and retribution is unclear — that is, we may have developed and bought into the idea of pure evil to justify our inherently retributive instincts rather than the other way around. It would also be interesting to explore narratives about pure evil in the realms of media and politics. Cultural differences could change the relationship between beliefs and punishment: in countries where politicians frequently invoke severe punishments or tend to ignore environmental factors in crime, for example, is there a generally higher level of belief in pure evil than in those areas where this isn’t the case? Future research could probe this further.</p>

Investigating the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption can help determine where to target intervention resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption</p></blockquote>
<p>Researchers from the University of Liverpool, Thompson and Pirmohamed, investigated the association between occupation and heavy alcohol consumption in working individuals aged 40-69 years in the UK. Thompson and Pirmohamed used the UK Biobank to recruit participants.</p>
<p>The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption, with jobs identified as skilled trades the most likely to be associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licensed premises, industrial cleaning process occupations, and plasterers. Whereas clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists and medical practitioners were least likely to be heavy drinkers. The authors findings help to determine which employment sectors may benefit most from health promotion programs.</p>

<blockquote><p>This highlights the need for prompt quality improvement</p></blockquote>
<p>Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium (PAD) management are key elements in the care of critically ill patients. However, previous research has highlighted the gap between actual clinical practices and physicians’ attitudes to PAD management. Zhou <em>et al.</em> investigated the current practice of PAD assessments in Chinese ICUs by a one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_12308" style="width: 341px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12308" height="158" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Capture2-300x143.png" width="331" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig. 5 taken from Zhou et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The authors concluded that the actual PAD assessment rate was suboptimal, especially with regards to delirium screening. There was a significant gap between the actual practice and the physicians’ perception of the practice. Physicians reported performing assessing pain and agitation-sedation in approximately only 20 to 25% of patients which is lower than previous reports. Therefore, the study highlights the need for prompt quality improvement and the optimization of practices of PAD management in ICUs in China.</p>

<p>Many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have sleep disturbance and this impacts their quality of life. However, it is not yet fully understood how sleep disturbance affects the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). Kuribayashi <em>et al.</em> carried out a prospective study on 20 patients to investigate the relationship between FD and sleep disturbance. Patients took sleep aids for 4 weeks and filled out questionnaires before and after taking sleep aids.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors found that sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids and as a result, GI symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with FD were also improved. In addition, the authors concluded that the use of sleep-inducing drugs was associated with reduced pain as well as improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in FD patients. Overall the study highlights the potential benefits of sleep aids for patients with FD and sleep disturbance, although multicenter studies involving a larger number of cases are needed to further investigate.</p>

However, the specific muscles that contribute to superior sprint performance for sprinters have not been fully identified. Suga <em>et al. </em>examined the relationships between the trunk and lower limb muscle cross-sectional areas and sprint performance in well-trained male sprinters.</p>
<p>Their findings showed that larger absolute and relative cross-sectional areas of the psoas major and gluteus maximus correlated with better personal best 100m sprint times. Therefore, the psoas major and gluteus maximus may be specific muscles for superior sprint performance for sprinters. The study also corroborates previous studies suggesting that the hamstring may not be an important muscle for achieving superior sprint performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#tab=tab_1">Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women</a> globally and cytology-based (Pap smear) screening is important for early detection and treatment. Although cervical cancer screening is beneficial and can enable early detection, a positive screening result might cause psychological burden. As a result, this may influence the decision to undergo further examination and future screening for cervical cancer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group</p></blockquote>
<p>Isaka <em>et al.</em> carried out a randomized control trial in Japan, with the intervention being the provision of cervical cancer information and cervical cancer screening information through a leaflet. The authors aim was to evaluate whether the leaflet would help reduce psychological distress. Women who were about to undergo cervical cancer screening received hypothetical screening results either with or without a leaflet, at random. Following the intervention, psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group than in the intervention group among those who received a hypothetical positive screening result. Therefore, the authors concluded that information provision might help reduce psychological distress and recommend that cervical cancer screening programs provide participants with all relevant information.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>When you’ve done something wrong, big or small, it can be hard to own up to it — particularly if you feel you’ve transgressed a moral or social code. Instead, you might avoid confronting the issue and become defensive. Yet defensiveness often has negative consequences anyway: it can hurt someone else’s feelings, cloud your ability to make a good decision in the moment, or prevent you from changing harmful behaviours.</p>



<p>But <em>why</em> do we get defensive, and what can we do to minimise those negative consequences? A <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12378">new study</a> from Michael Wenzel and colleagues at Flinders University, published in the <em>British Journal of Social Psychology, </em>asks both of these questions — and finds that defensiveness could be reduced by affirming people’s moral and social worth.</p>



<span id="more-41474"></span>



<p>In the first study, 187 participants were asked to recall an incident in which they had wronged somebody else, writing a brief description of what they had done. They then rated how severe the transgression was, the importance of their relationship with the person they had wronged, how guilty they felt and how much they accepted blame (e.g. “I wasn’t the one to blame for what happened”), and how loved and accepted they felt despite any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Participants then took part in an implicit guilt test, a version of the (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">controversial</a>) Implicit Association Test. This essentially looked at how quick participants were to categorise self-related words (e.g. “me”) when they also had to press the same key to categorise guilt-related words (e.g. “blame”) versus when they had to press the same key to categorise innocence-related words (e.g. “virtue”). If they were faster for the former, this was taken as an implicit association of the self with guilt.</p>



<p>The results suggested that those participants who felt a higher need for belonging were more likely to engage in defensiveness: the more “implicit” guilt they showed on the test, the less likely they were to assert that they were to blame for the incident they outlined. Those who felt socially accepted, on the other hand, were more likely to express explicit guilt as their level of implicit guilt increased.</p>



<p>In the second study, omnivorous participants were shown a short video about cruelty within the egg and meat industry before speaking to a bot, which either affirmed or denigrated their choice to eat meat.</p>



<p>Watching the video on animal cruelty led to greater guilt and concerns about moral or social transgression — but only when there was no opportunity to have that guilt assuaged through the online chat. Those participants who <em>had</em> received reassurance from the bot about eating meat were also more likely to explicitly express guilt that reflected their levels of implicit guilt. Those who had not received reassurance saw a greater disconnect between implicit and explicit guilt, suggesting a level of defensiveness.</p>



<p>Participants who had received reassurance from the bot were also more likely to donate to an animal rights organisation, while those who had not were less likely to donate the more implicit guilt they indicated. This, the team says, suggests that threats to acceptance can lead not only to increased defensiveness but also an unwillingness to repair harm.</p>



<p>As noted, the Implicit Association Test has faced serious scrutiny over the last few years, with some critics suggesting that the test may not be truly indicative of real-life thoughts or behaviours. The team also acknowledges that the relationship between implicit and explicit guilt may not be as straightforward as the results suggest — defensiveness may be so effective a psychological process, they write, that it may reduce or even eliminate implicit evaluations or admissions of responsibility and guilt. In other words, defensiveness may not only be an external avoidance of blame but an internal one, which individuals are not aware of themselves. External admissions of guilt may also be unreflective of true or implicit feelings of guilt — someone might profusely apologise for reasons that are more to do with social pressure than real feeling.</p>



<p>Still, the results suggest a key element of defensiveness is a feeling of moral or social threat. Where individuals are given affirmation, defensiveness decreases — and more efforts are made to repair harm. It may be difficult to give someone such reassurance, particularly when you’re the one they’ve harmed — but it could also be the best way of helping them truly engage with what they’ve done.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite many efforts to make workplaces more equitable, women are still frequently discriminated against at work. Companies run by women are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/">judged more harshly</a> on ethical failings, for instance, and women are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/">more likely to be lied to</a> in performance reviews. This discrimination doesn’t just happen <em>in</em> the workplace: it can happen before someone is even employed. A study from last year, for example, found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/03/black-women-with-natural-hair-face-biases-from-potential-employers/">Black women with natural hair are seen as less competent and professional than their White counterparts</a> when interviewing for jobs.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01033-0">new study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, has taken a look at what could be scuppering women’s chances even before they get to the interview stage. The team, led by Brian J Lucas from Cornell University, argues that in organisations where recruitment takes place on an informal basis, via colleague recommendations or other word-of-mouth networks, changes need to be made to the shortlisting process. When shortlists are longer, the results suggest, women are more likely to be seriously considered.</p>



<span id="more-41468"></span>



<p>The first few studies looked at how longer shortlists might impact gender representation. Participants imagined being a filmmaker, and were asked to draw up a shortlist of actors to appear in their upcoming action film. In the first stage, participants gave just three suggestions, before being instructed to give three more — the hypothesis being that more women would be listed during the second stage than the first. The results showed that the number of women actors was indeed significantly higher in this second part of the list.</p>



<p>In the second series of studies, participants working in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry were asked to imagine themselves as a corporate strategist, scoping the market for a new CEO. They were again asked at the first stage to suggest three candidates and at the second stage to suggest three more. Results reflected those of the first study: there were significantly more women candidates listed at the second stage compared to the first.</p>



<p>In a third study, parents were asked again for a short and long list, this time naming role models for their male or female child. For parents of boys, results were similar to the prior studies: they named more women role models at the second stage than the first. But the opposite was true of parents of girls. This suggests that in longer lists, people are more likely to include candidates who don’t meet the gender prototype for the role. In certain industries, the prototypical hire is highly likely to be male, explaining why longer candidate lists tend to contain more women.</p>



<p>In the final two studies, participants completed the film director shortlist task from the first study or the technology executive shortlist task from the second — only this time, they were randomly assigned to generate either a three-person shortlist or a six-person shortlist, ranking candidates in order of preference. Again, longer shortlists had a positive effect when it came to inclusion: six-person shortlists featured significantly more women candidates than three-person shortlists. And importantly, six-person shortlists also had a higher <em>proportion </em>of female candidates.</p>



<p>The longer shortlist was also good news for women in terms of actual selection — that is, how highly women candidates were ranked by participants. Participants in the six-person condition were more likely to select women as top candidates than those in the three-person condition, suggesting that longer shortlists can have an impact not only on who gets a tentative foot in the door but who actually ends up with the job.</p>



<p>This type of gender bias is probably not always intentional: many of those informally suggesting candidates for roles will not be purposefully excluding women. Nevertheless, ensuring a move away from informal hiring practices and towards thoughtful, structured ones — blind CV selection, for example, or longer shortlists — could be a way of equalising unbalanced workforces.</p>



<p>As the study on Black women’s hair tells us, however, other factors like race, class and sexuality are likely to play a part in how people are perceived in interviews and in the workplace. Transgender or non-binary people are also likely to face different challenges. How would such candidates fare when it comes to shortlisting? Further research could explore this more.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You can’t bullshit a bullshitter. Well, that’s the saying — but is it true? Shane Littrell and colleagues at the University of Waterloo, Canada, set out to investigate. And in a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjso.12447?campaign=wolearlyview">new paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Social Psychology</em> they report that, in fact, people who bullshit more often in a bid to impress or persuade others are also more susceptible to bullshit themselves. The reason for this — also uncovered by the team — is truly fascinating.</p>



<span id="more-41506"></span>



<p>Some earlier work has suggested that better liars are also better at detecting lies. But as the team notes, bullshit isn’t quite the same, as it falls just short of outright deception. Recently, researchers have begun to treat bullshitting as having two separate dimensions. “Persuasive bullshitting” is motivated by a desire to impress or persuade. “Evasive bullshitting” is different — as a “strategic circumnavigation of the truth”, it’s the sort that a politician might engage in when trying to cover up a mistake, for example. By definition, the creation of either type of bullshit is intentional, though of course the spreading of bullshit may not be. </p>



<p>In an initial study, 219 adults recruited online completed the <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjso.12379">Bullshitting Frequency Scale</a>. (This assesses, for example, how likely you think you are to persuasively bullshit a contribution to a discussion on a topic that you don’t know much about, or to evasively bullshit “when being fully honest would be harmful or embarrassing to me or someone else.”) These participants also completed the Bullshit Receptivity Scale, using a 5-point scale to rate the level of profundity of 10 made up but grammatically correct sentences, all of which had been constructed from pseudo-profound buzzwords. (If “We are in the midst of a high-frequency blossoming of interconnectedness that will give us access to the quantum soup itself” sounds extremely profound to you, you’d probably score highly on this scale…).</p>



<p>The participants also completed scales that assessed their receptivity to “scientific bullshit” (e.g. feeling that a randomly generated sentence that used a lot of terms like “entropy”, “constructive interference” and “quantum ground states” is probably genuine) and also to fake news. For this, the participants were presented with five factually accurate and five fake news items. The latter were taken from a list of genuine popular recent fake news items. The participants had to indicate how accurate they believed each headline to be. </p>



<p>The team found that people who reported engaging in more persuasive bullshitting were more receptive to all forms of bullshit (pseudo-profound, pseudo-scientific and fake news). However, higher scores for evasive bullshitting were not related to susceptibility to the first two forms of bullshit, and were actually associated with <em>less </em>susceptibility to believing fake news.</p>



<p>In a subsequent study, the team found that, when levels of evasive bullshitting were controlled for, people who engaged in more persuasive bullshitting were not only more receptive to pseudo-profound bullshit but were also more over-confident in their own intellectual ability. They also scored lower for cognitive ability (measured using simple numeracy and vocabulary tests) and reported less insight into their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. In contrast, when persuasive bullshitting was controlled for, high evasive bullshitters scored higher on the tests of cognitive ability. As the researchers write, “persuasive bullshitting may rely on less engagement in analytic thinking processes compared to evasive bullshitting”.</p>



<p>The team wondered if persuasive bullshitters might have difficulty telling apart statements that actually are profound from those that only sound profound. So they asked a new group of 400 participants to rate the profundity of various sentences (sentences in the genuinely profound list included, “A river cuts through a rock not because of its power but its persistence”, for example). The results were clear: while those who scored highly for evasive bullshitting were also better at distinguishing between the genuinely profound and the pseudo-profound statements, the high persuasive bullshitters were poor at this. “Put another way, high persuasive bullshitters appear to interpret/mistake <em>superficial profoundness</em> as a signal of <em>actual profoundness</em>,” the team explains.</p>



<p>Overall, the results of the three studies are consistent: “one <em>can</em> ‘bullshit a bullshitter’.” And as the frequent persuasive bullshitters were also more over-confident in their intellectual abilities, they could be seen as experiencing their own <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056">Dunning-Kruger</a> type effect, and suffer from a “bullshit blindspot”, the researchers add. (It’s worth noting that they didn’t explore how good these participants actually were at bullshitting — just because they did it more often doesn’t mean they’re better at it.)</p>



<p>Understanding what makes some people more likely to believe misleading information — and right now, there’s a lot of that around COVID-19 vaccines, of course — is crucial. This work does suggest that the people who like to bullshit themselves are more likely to fall for it, too. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></h4>

<p>Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?</p><p>Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.</p><p>Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene <em>UBE3A</em>, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?</p><p>The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are <em>covertly conscious</em>—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.</p><p>Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true">dreamless sleep</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;tag=1">anesthesia</a>. Interestingly, it is also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421">increased by psychedelic drugs</a> that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?</p><p>My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1">to test this hypothesis</a> using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.</p><p>As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.</p><p>But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.</p><p>The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.</p><p>Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.</p><p>The above technique, called the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf">perturbational complexity index</a> or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645656224/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/" rel="nofollow">Disability, access, and the virtual conference</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/addressing-health-inequity-in-disparities-of-cancer-outcomes/" rel="nofollow">Addressing health inequity in disparities of cancer outcomes</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/" rel="nofollow">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Social justice movements, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, have done huge amounts to address racism and sexism in our society. It’s now common for organisations to have diversity programmes, for example. As Ashley Martin at Stanford University and Michael S North at New York University note in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-08078-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, Facebook has famously invested millions of dollars in increasing diversity. However — and this is a big <em>however</em> — the pair’s work reveals that people who are keenest to advocate for women and racial minorities harbour more prejudice against a group that reports <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statistics/charge-statistics-charges-filed-eeoc-fy-1997-through-fy-2019">almost as much US workplace discrimination</a> as these two: older people. </p>



<span id="more-41461"></span>



<p>As the researchers note, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has said that “younger people are just smarter” while Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, which has won awards for diversity and inclusion, has opined that “people over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas”. They are not alone in this attitude — broader society (or at least US and UK society, as a generalisation) finds ageism acceptable, too. “Ageism is so condoned in American culture that many do not see it as an ‘-ism’, in the same manner of other forms of prejudice,” the researchers note.  And yet, older people as a group are disadvantaged, and have more limited opportunities.</p>



<p>To explore ageism and how it might interact with views on sexism and racism, the researchers ran a series of seven studies. A critical measure in each was a participant’s level of “egalitarian advocacy” — their belief in and commitment to creating a more egalitarian world. This was assessed using a scale that the researchers had developed, which gauged participants’ agreement with statements like “I feel angry when I think about the injustices and inequality in society”.</p>



<p>In initial online studies, the team found that people who scored higher on this scale were more disapproving of racism and sexism but also more likely to endorse “Succession-based ageism” — the idea that older people should step aside to improve younger people’s job opportunities.</p>



<p>In a later study, 298 participants were given a theoretical scenario in which a company had a million-dollar fund for improving diversity, to split between a number of minority groups. The researchers found that the more that participants endorsed egalitarian advocacy, the more money they wanted to go to women and racial minorities — and the less they wanted to go to older people. Questionnaire results showed that this was driven by a belief that older people block women and racial minorities from getting ahead. “Together, this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some,” write Martin and North.</p>



<p>Is there any way, then, to encourage people to be less ageist? Well, the pair did also find that when participants were informed about the true, difficult economic state of many older people in the US — many of whom simply cannot afford to retire — this made a difference. In fact, after this intervention, participants who were more egalitarian showed the biggest reductions in their bias against older people.</p>



<p>The pair then looked for possible nuances in prejudice against older people. They found that though biases were strongest against older White men, older Black women were also subject to them. (They did explore who participants had in mind when thinking about older people who “should” step aside, and though older White men certainly did feature, the group was much broader.) Egalitarians did, though, report “liking” and wanting to interact with older Black women more. So, as the researchers note, this particular older group was supported in other ways.</p>



<p>Of course, older people represent a fast-growing demographic. This means there’s an urgent need for more research into ageism, and how it might be tackled. Current diversity initiatives focus far more frequently on race, gender and LGBTQ, rather than age, the researchers note. “As organisations contribute more money than ever before to increasing diversity, it is increasingly necessary to take stock of who is being included, versus who is being left behind,” the pair writes.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-08078-001">Equality for (almost) all: Egalitarian advocacy predicts lower endorsement of sexism and racism, but not ageism.</a></p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
"microstates".</p>
<p>To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.</p>
<p>We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It’s not hard to find ways to stay busy during lockdown. Yes, many of us are spending lots of time at home and have evenings and weekends free from almost any kind of social activity — but we’re also juggling work, chores, childcare, life admin and the various emotional demands of living through a global pandemic.</p>



<p>For some, in fact, staying busy has been an appealing prospect; indeed, hundreds of articles have been written with ideas on how to stay busy and distracted <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/18/how-to-deal-with-boredom-digested/">during the boredom of lockdown</a>. But a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244631">new study</a> from a team at Australia’s RMIT University, published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, suggests that <em>meaningful</em> activity, rather than simply busyness, may be the way to stay emotionally stable during this period.</p>



<span id="more-41518"></span>



<p>All 95 participants were adults engaging in some form of social distancing. After sharing demographic data, participants rated themselves on a number of wellbeing measures, both as they were at the time of the study and as they were one month before the start of social distancing. These measures covered anxiety, panic, loneliness, depression, crying, cheerfulness, contentedness and laughter. Through these measures, the team was able to measure change in both positive and negative affect.</p>



<p>Participants also indicated how much time they had spent on various activities before and during social distancing, including being outside the home, talking online and off, engaging with childcare or other chores, working, watching TV, reading or other creative pursuits, and doing nothing. Participants also indicated how important they felt each activity was to them.</p>



<p>When, during lockdown, participants began to engage in more activities they found meaningful, they saw a reduction in both positive and negative affect. But increased busyness with activities participants didn’t consider important was related to <em>increases</em> in both positive and negative mood.</p>



<p>At first glance, this seems to suggest that busyness is more desirable overall — you might be crying more, but you’re also laughing, right? The team thinks not. Instead, they argue that the extremes induced by busy but meaningless activity suggests participants were unsettled and unable to regulate their emotions. In other words, while busyness can make you feel more agitated and therefore prone to mood swings, meaningful activity is more likely to calm you down, soothing both extremes.</p>



<p>As senior author Lauren Saling <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/media-releases-and-expert-comments/2021/jan/lockdown-busyness">puts it</a>, “extreme emotions are not necessarily a good thing… when you’re doing what you love, it makes sense that you feel more balanced – simply keeping busy isn’t satisfying.”</p>



<p>There are some obvious limitations to the work — for one, the fact that participants had to recall how they felt a month before lockdown started. It’s easy to imagine that at least some participants would have been unable to accurately recall how they felt, perhaps even romanticising fairly mundane activities which they were, at that point, barred from doing. And away from individual emotions, how much were lockdown activities impacting <em>general</em> life satisfaction?</p>



<p>We’re now nearly a year into various kinds of lockdown, so it’s easy to look at studies like this and beat yourself up, especially if you’re spending more time aimlessly playing video games than engaging in activities you know you’d probably find more meaningful. We’re all doing what we can to cope with distressing (and incredibly tedious) circumstances — but trying to balance meaning and mindlessness might be one way for us all to do that better.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How important is it to you to protect our planet’s wildest places? Would you put a price on it — or is it the kind of goal that just can’t be subject to a cost-benefit analysis? If the latter, then for you, protecting Earth’s wilds is a “sacred value”. Patriotism, or the protection of human lives, or diversity in the workplace can be sacred values, too. So what happens when a for-profit organisation embraces such values — is the pursuit of social or environmental values <em>and</em> profit a “win-win”, as is often claimed?</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-07851-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes</em>, suggests not — and it’s the value that suffers, as it becomes less sacred. If this is right, then businesses that co-opt such values in their advertising (think no end of outdoor clothing companies that make a big deal about caring for the wilderness, as just one example) are degrading the very values that they claim to promote.</p>



<span id="more-41501"></span>



<p>Rachel L Ruttan at the University of Toronto and Loran F Nordgren at Northwestern University base their conclusions on the results of seven studies on a total of 2,785 participants. In initial studies, participants who read a pro-environment message from a for-profit producer of agricultural equipment subsequently felt that environmentalism was less sacred than did participants who’d read the same message, but from the environmental body Conservation International. The “sacredness scale” used by the researchers assessed levels of feeling that a value (such as environmentalism) is “sacred”, and something that should not be sacrificed, no matter the benefits, but rather defended under any circumstance.</p>



<p>In a further study, participants who read that an organisation was launching a pro-environmental campaign to drive greater profits or for better PR subsequently felt that environmentalism was less sacred, compared with participants who’d read that the new campaign was driven by a desire for greater sustainability.</p>



<p>Earlier work has suggested that when a value is overtly threatened, this <em>reinforces</em> the desire of someone who upholds that value to protect it. However, the use of sacred values in the pursuit of corporate gain might not always seem like an obvious threat to these values, point out the researchers. Indeed, when Ruttan and Nordgren explored this in two further studies, the sacredness of a value was only degraded when participants did <em>not</em> perceive an action as clearly threatening or undermining that value . So, to keep with the same example (though of course there are others), when an outdoor clothing company pledges to donate a portion of its profits to protecting areas of wilderness, though this might seem like a “good thing”, it could work insidiously to degrade the sanctity of the value of wilderness protection — which could ultimately weaken protection efforts.</p>



<p>This possibility is supported by the results of the seventh study. In 2015, two US senators (including John McCain) issued a report documenting how the NFL was being paid by the US military to put on patriotic displays. This was widely picked up by US media. The researchers wondered whether people who were aware of this “paid patriotism” would subsequently hold patriotism as being less sacred. So they gave online participants a quiz that was ostensibly about their knowledge of the NFL, but which included this question: “Is it true or false that the term ‘Paid Patriotism’ was used to describe the practice of NFL teams accepting money to put on patriotic displays at games?”</p>



<p>Next, the participants were asked for their opinion on a purported potential NFL policy change: that singing the national anthem at games would become voluntary, and the choice of individual teams, rather than mandatory. The researchers found that participants who were aware of paid patriotism were significantly less likely to feel that “no matter how great the benefits, this shouldn’t be done”; that is, they were less likely to hold patriotism sacred. (This link held when controlling for a range of factors, including political orientation, education and a history of military service.) The results suggest that an awareness of paid patriotism decreased the sanctity of the value of patriotism.</p>



<p>“As markets increasingly interface with our sacred values — be it through advertisements, product offerings, promoting the strategic advantages of a diverse workforce, or Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives — it becomes increasingly important to understand the effects of using sacred values towards market aims on perceptions of and commitment to values,” the researchers write. </p>



<p>Clearly, there’s a lot more work to be done in this area — to investigate whether the same effects might hold in other countries, as well as in more real-world scenarios, for example. But it does suggest that if “do-gooder” actions and initiatives by companies are perceived to be driven by a desire to enhance the bottom line, this could undermine the very value that they’re endorsing — whether it springs from a “win-win” motivation, or not.</p>

<p>Author: Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer</p>



<p>We are delighted to announce the creation of the PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council">Scientific Advisory Council</a>, a small group of active researchers with diverse perspectives to help us shape our efforts to promote Open Science, globally.</p>



<p>PLOS, as a non-profit organization committed to empowering researchers to change research communication, cannot successfully pursue its mission without listening to the research community. We regularly survey and consult the research communities we work with, formally and informally, to guide our choices and developments. The organization’s governance, including our <a href="https://plos.org/about/board-of-directors/">Board of Directors</a>, has always involved active researchers. And we derive great insight and advice from our continuous exchange with the academic Editors of PLOS journals. </p>



<p>We’ve decided to take an additional formal step and create a forum where the researchers who contribute to PLOS through different channels can interact directly with each other, and to ensure that this forum includes voices from researchers around the globe. </p>



<p>We’ve created the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council, a small group of researchers who represent varied scientific and career perspectives, who will advise PLOS executive and editorial leadership on strategic questions of scientific interest. </p>



<p>At this point, the Scientific Advisory Council is deliberately small–about a dozen individuals–to ensure in-depth discussions and engagement, but we’ve strived to include different disciplinary interests, career stages and geographic representation. The group includes four PLOS Board members who are themselves active researchers, two of our journals’ academic Editors-in-Chief, alongside researchers who are not formally associated with PLOS. </p>



<p>We are delighted to welcome the following members to the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council. To see their photos and full bios, please visit their <a href="https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council">page </a>on our website: </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>What — or who — do you think about when you hear the word “atheist”? Someone scientific, rational, and open-minded? Or, instead, someone who lacks morality, or who is less trustworthy than your average religious person? Prior research hasn’t been wholly positive for non-believers, finding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/24/distrust-of-atheists-is-deeply-and-culturally-ingrained-even-among-atheists/">serious levels of distrust</a> of atheists — even among atheists themselves.</p>



<p>But the real picture might be slightly more complicated. According to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620982703">a new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, positive <em>and</em> negative stereotypes abound when it comes to atheists. And for many, these stereotypes exist at the same time: people can believe atheists to be fun and open-minded just as they find them to be immoral.</p>



<span id="more-41493"></span>



<p>Although past work has mainly looked at negative stereotypes of atheists, there is reason to believe that people could, simultaneously, hold positive stereotypes. You might perceive atheists as uninhibited and rebellious and want to invite them to a party or have them serve you at a restaurant, for example — but you may not want them to look after your children for exactly the same reason.</p>



<p>The first study looked precisely at these traits, testing the hypothesis that people see atheists as fun, open-minded and scientific (and the religious as the opposite). Participants were randomly assigned to read three vignettes in which a character either displayed one of these three traits (e.g. fun), or its opposite (e.g. not fun). They were then asked which of two sentences about the character seemed more probable. One statement was standalone and the other was linked to religion or atheism: e.g. “Henry is a teacher” or “Henry is a teacher and [an atheist/believes in God]”.</p>



<p>Participants were more likely to link being fun, open-minded and scientific to atheism, while they viewed the opposite traits as more representative of religious people. The extent to which this was true varied based on how religious the participants were themselves: people of high and low religiosity believed atheists were fun and scientific, but highly religious people were less likely to consider atheists as particularly open-minded. A second study replicated these findings, as well as adding another element: the stereotype of atheists as immoral, which participants tended to agree with. </p>



<p>A third study looked at the contexts in which people prefer atheists or religious people. Participants were presented with a choice between the two in a number of hypothetical situations, each related to the positive stereotypes identified in the first two studies: e.g. “which would you choose if you wanted to attend a fun party: one thrown by an atheist or by a religious person?”, “which would you choose if you wanted to have an open-minded political conversation with someone?” or “which would you choose if you wanted a tutor for a high-level college course in the physical sciences?” To disguise the purpose of the study, five distractor scenarios (e.g. hiring a mechanic) were included with five different targets (e.g. Mac users vs. PC users).</p>



<p>As expected, participants preferred atheist partners in fun, open-minded and scientific situations. This was not the case for highly religious participants, however — while they had no bias towards religious or atheist party hosts, they did strongly favour conversational partners and science tutors who shared their beliefs.</p>



<p>The team suggests that the results could have serious implications for non-believers: though being considered fun is hardly the worst thing in the world, it could also lead to negative ramifications like being passed over for career opportunities or being seen as an inappropriate romantic prospect. It would be interesting to explore how much positive and negative stereotypes actually stand in the way for atheists in the real world, and in what domains.</p>



<p>Overall, the study paints an interesting picture of how we see both atheists and religious people — and how our own beliefs colour those pictures. While some certainly do have firm, rigid ideas about certain groups, these results suggest that for many of us stereotyping is somewhat more fluid.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/usa-1120579_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol and firearms are a dangerous combination and are commonly involved in suicide in the United States. This has only increased in importance as a public health issue as alcohol drinking, firearm sales, and suicides in the United States have all increased since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. State alcohol policies and state firearm policies might impact alcohol and firearm related suicide, but it is unknown how these policies specifically relate to these suicides, or how these policies might interact with one another.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess relationships between alcohol policies, firearm policies, and U.S. suicides in 2015 involving alcohol, firearms, or both. We used the Alcohol Policy Scale, previously created and validated by our team, to assess alcohol policies and the Gun Law Scorecard from Giffords Law Center to quantify firearm policies. Suicide data came from the National Violent Death Reporting System. State- and individual-level GEE Poisson and logistic regression models assessed relationships between policies and firearm- and/or alcohol-involved suicides with a 1-year lag.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the United States in 2015, alcohol and/or firearms were involved in 63.9% of suicides. Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 28% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol or firearms. Similarly, a 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 14% decrease in the rate of suicides involving firearms.</p>
<p>These relationships were similar for suicides that involved alcohol and firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 52% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms. A 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 26% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.</p>
<p>In addition, we found synergistic effects between alcohol and firearm policies, such that states with restrictive policies for both alcohol and firearms had the lowest odds of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and next steps</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Results of the study suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals, including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.</p></blockquote>
<p>We found restrictive alcohol and firearm policies to be associated with lower rates and odds of suicides involving alcohol or firearms, and alcohol and firearms and our research suggests that alcohol and firearm policies may be a promising means by which to reduce suicide. These protective relationships were particularly striking for suicides involving both alcohol and firearms as well as in the strong protective interaction between alcohol and firearm policy variables, particularly for suicides involving alcohol. These findings, taken in the context of the broader literature, also suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals (so-called ‘may issue’ laws), including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.</p>
<p>Because this was a cross-sectional analysis, this should be considered a hypothesis-generating study that cannot prove a causal association between alcohol or firearm policies and suicide. In future research, studies using multiple years of policy and suicide data would strengthen causal inference.</p>
<p>Stronger alcohol and firearm policies are a promising means to prevent a leading and increasing cause of death in the U.S. The findings further suggest that strengthening both policy areas may have a synergistic impact on reducing suicides involving either alcohol, firearms, or both.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/">Why arXiv needs a brand</a></h4>

<p><strong>Pop quiz: There are so many “-Xivs” online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: only <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv"><strong>@arXiv</strong></a></p>
<p>arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.</p>
<p>“As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,” said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.</p>
<p>In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.</p>
<p>Throughout the identity project, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>assessed user feedback collected since 2016,</li>
<li>surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,</li>
<li>gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,</li>
<li>contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and</li>
<li>are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To guide our branding efforts we focused on <b>arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science</b>. After many rounds of revision and refinement, <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">arXiv’s first brand guide</a> was produced, in addition to our new logo and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a>, and we’d like to share them with you now.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_948" style="width: 300px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png"><img alt="arXiv's logo" class="wp-image-948 size-medium" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;" width="260" /></a>The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection</figure>
<p>The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, <strong>the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo</strong> captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">brand guide</a> and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a> ensure that we express arXiv’s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.</p>
<p>The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.</p>
<p>“arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,” said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.</p>

<h2>Where is the red nucleus?</h2><p class="">The red nucleus is found in a region of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/midbrain" target="_blank">midbrain</a>. There are actually two red nuclei—one on each side of the brainstem. </p><p class="">The red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures that are generally distinct in function: the parvocellular red nucleus, which mainly contains small and medium-sized <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a>, and the magnocellular red nucleus, which contains larger neurons. The red nucleus is recognizable immediately after dissection because it maintains a reddish coloring. This coloring is thought to be due to iron pigments found in the cells of the nucleus.</p><h2>What is the red nucleus and what does it do?</h2><p class="">As mentioned above, the red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures with separate functions: the parvocellular red nucleus and the magnocellular red nucleus. In the human brain, most of the red nucleus is made up of the parvocellular red nucleus, or RNp; the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is not thought to play a major role in the adult human brain. In four-legged mammals (e.g., cats, mice), however, the RNm is a more prominent structure—in both size and importance.</p><p class="">Neurons from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum" target="_blank">cerebellum</a> project to the RNm, and RNm neurons leave the red nucleus and form the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/rubrospinal-tract" target="_blank">rubrospinal tract</a>, which descends in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>. In animals that walk on four legs, this pathway is activated around the time of voluntary movements; it seems to play an important role in walking, avoiding obstacles, and making coordinated paw movements. RNm neurons, however, also respond to sensory stimulation, and may provide sensory feedback to the cerebellum to help guide movements and maintain postural stability. </p><p class="">In primates that mainly walk on two legs (including humans), the RNm is not thought to play a large role in walking and maintaining postural stability, as other tracts (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticospinal-tract" target="_blank">corticospinal tract</a>) take over such functions. The RNm, however, does appear to be involved in controlling hand movements in humans and other primates. Interestingly, the RNm is more prominent in the human fetus and newborn, but regresses as a child ages, which may have to do with the development of corticospinal tract and the ability to walk on two legs.</p><p class="">Despite its relatively greater import in the human brain, the RNp is poorly understood, as its diminished presence in other animals makes it more difficult to study using an animal model. Neurons from motor areas in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/prefrontal-cortex" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/premotor-cortex" target="_blank">premotor cortex</a>, as well as neurons from nuclei in the cerebellum known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-cerebellar-nuclei" target="_blank">deep cerebellar nuclei</a>, extend to the RNp. There is also a collection of neurons that leave the RNp and travel to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-olivary-nucleus" target="_blank">inferior olivary nucleus</a>, which communicates with the cerebellum and is thought to be involved in the control of movement. A number of proposed functions have been attributed to these connections between the RNp, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus, such as movement learning, the acquisition of reflexes, and the detection of errors in movements. But the precise function of these pathways—and thus the RNp’s role in them—is still not clear.</p><p class="">Several studies have found the red nucleus to play a role in pain sensation as well as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/analgesia" target="_blank">analgesia</a>. The latter might be due to connections between the red nucleus and regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/periaqueductal-gray" target="_blank">periaqueductal gray</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/raphe-nuclei" target="_blank">raphe nuclei</a>, which are part of a natural pain-inhibiting system in the brain. </p><p class="">In terms of pathology, dysfunction in the human red nucleus has been linked to the development of tremors, and is being investigated as playing a potential role in <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Damage to the red nucleus has also been associated with a number of other problems with movement and muscle tone.</p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Basile GA, Quartu M, Bertino S, Serra MP, Boi M, Bramanti A, Anastasi GP, Milardi D, Cacciola A.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/hookah-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Water pipe smoking as a public health crisis</strong></p>
<p>Water Pipe Smoking (WPS) accounts for a significant and growing share of tobacco use globally. WPS is a culture-based method of tobacco use and it has experienced a worldwide re-emergence since 1990 and is regaining popularity among different groups of populations, especially in school and university students. Similarly, WPS is also prevalent among highly educated groups. Although WPS is most prevalent in Asia, specifically the Middle East region and Africa, it has now been changed to a rapidly emerging problem in other continents such as Europe, North, and South America.</p>
<blockquote><p>WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been shown that WPS’ smoking rate can be more addictive compared to that of the cigarette. It has a huge negative impact on populations’ health, health costs and the gross domestic product of the countries. WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS. Using deceptive advertising, many cafes and restaurants offer WP services along with their orthodox services in order to earn more profit and lure more customers. The provision of flavored tobacco products or psychotropic WP, the proximity of WP cafe to the public settings such as educational or residential settings and sports clubs, tempting decoration, the provision of study places for students, live music, a variety of games and gambling, and the possibility of watching live movie and sport matches are the factors contribute to attracting children and adolescents to WP cafes.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of our study</strong></p>
<p>Despite the concerns about WPS outcomes and nearly three decades of using control measures, the prevalence of WPS has increased over the world. Due to the unique nature of WP (multi-components), little is known about the prevention and control of WPS. Thus, special interventions might be required to prevent and control WP tobacco use. Accordingly, our study published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> aimed to identify the management interventions in international and national levels for preventing and controlling water pipe smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We conducted a systematic literature review. Studies aiming at evaluating, at least, one intervention in preventing and controlling WPS were included in this review, followed by performing the quality assessment and data extraction of eligible studies by two independent investigators.</p>
<p>After deleting duplications, 2228 out of 4343 retrieved records remained and 38 studies were selected as the main corpus of the present study. The selected studies focused on 19 different countries including the United States (13.15 %), the United Kingdom (7.89 %), Germany (5.26 %), Iran (5.26 %), Egypt (5.26%), Malaysia (2.63%), India (2.63%), Denmark (2.63%), Pakistan (2.63%), Qatar (2.63%), Jordan(2.63%), Lebanon (2.63%), Syria (2.63%), Turkey (2.63%), Bahrain (2.63%), Israel (2.63%), the United Arab Emirates (2.63%), Saudi Arabia (2.63%), and Switzerland (2.63%). Additionally, the type of study design included cross-sectional (31.57 %), quasi-experimental (15.78 %) and qualitative types (23.68 %).</p>
<p>Interventions that were identified from the content analysis process were discussed and classified into relevant categories. We identified 27 interventions that were grouped into four main categories including preventive (5,18.51%) and control (8, 29.62%) interventions, as well as the enactment and implementation of legislations and policies for controlling WPS at national (7, 25.92%) and international (7, 25.92%) levels. The interventions are shown in the following table.</p>

<p><strong>Study implications</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, our findings indicated WPS related social and health crisis have not come into attention in high levels of policy making. The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence. In addition, the WP industry is rapidly expanding without monitoring and controlling measures. Informing and empowering adolescents for those who have not yet experienced smoking is a sensible intervention in this regard. Besides, empowering and involving health students and professionals in WPS control programs can lead to promising results in preventing and controlling WPS. It seems that there is a paucity of evidence regarding strategies on controlling and preventing WTS, thus further research in the society is warranted in this respect.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p>Back in the 1970s, the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget discovered that, if you ask young children to explain the mechanics of vision as they understand them, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-24948-001">their answers tend to reveal the exact same misconception</a>: that the eyes emit some sort of immaterial substance into the environment and capture the sights of objects much like a projector.</p>



<p>Although this belief declines with age, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12094435/">it is still surprisingly prevalent in adults</a>. What’s more, so-called extramission theories of vision have a long-running history dating all the way back to antiquity. The Greek philosopher Empedocles was amongst the first to suggest in the 5<sup>th</sup> century BC that our ability to see must stem from an invisible fire beaming out of our eyes to interact with our surroundings. This view was subsequently endorsed by intellectual authorities like Ptolemy and Galen.</p>



<p>Now, a duo of researchers behind a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/50/32165">recent publication in <em>PNAS</em></a> think they might have found an explanation for the intuitive appeal of extramission theories. According to their paper, this worldview might just be a reflection of the mechanisms that play out within our brains when we follow other people’s gazes and track where they pay attention. This is because, to carry out this process, our brains actually conjure illusory beams of motion emanating from other’s faces — a quirk of evolution with interesting consequences.</p>



<span id="more-41455"></span>



<p>Scientists had already found signs that this was taking place. For instance, when people spend time looking at an image of someone gazing sideways at an object, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008220300526">they temporarily become slower at spotting subtle movement in that same direction</a>. It is as if our brains treat the experience of seeing a pair of glancing eyes as an animated display of motion flowing towards the object of attention. This fatigues the brain region responsible for processing movement and renders it briefly “blind” to real motion along that same direction.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, an fMRI brain scanning study further deepened scientists’ suspicions. It showed that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/23/13162#:~:text=Specific%20regions%20of%20the%20human,to%20the%20gazed%2Dupon%20object.&amp;text=of%20visual%20attention.-,It%20is%20as%20if%20the%20brain%20draws%20a%20quick%20visual,who%20is%20attending%20to%20what">watching someone gazing at an object activated the motion-sensitive regions of our brains</a> in a pattern that was remarkably similar to that triggered by the experience of viewing actual motion.  </p>



<p>Tantalising as this evidence was, it was virtually impossible to conclude that this motion signal played any causal role in how we track people’s attention. Sceptical researchers suggested that the signal might simply reflect study participants imagining people reaching for the objects of their interest.</p>



<p>With this in mind, Arvid Guterstam and Michael Graziano — the Princeton University psychologists behind the recent <em>PNAS</em> publication — decided to set the causal record straight. They did this by testing whether meddling with the brain’s internal motion signal, using real (but subliminal) movement, could manipulate people’s perceptions of where someone was attending.</p>



<p>In their study, participants looked at a screen where two faces, set against a background of randomly moving black dots, gazed in the general direction of an object located at the center. They were asked to indicate which face seemed to be paying more attention to that item. But unbeknownst to them, these faces were actually mirror images, so participants unsurprisingly selected one or the other face with equal probability.</p>



<p>This changed when the researchers stealthily introduced a subtle signal in the background: a beam-shaped area emanating from the one of the faces, in which 30% of dots were made to drift coherently in the direction of the object. The manipulation was subtle enough that only seven out of over 650 participants were actually aware of it. And yet, it had a significant impact on how they attributed attention. On the trials where the subliminal beam of motion was flowing away from the left face, participants were 6% more likely to judge that face as paying more attention to the object — a significant deviation from their baseline indecisiveness.  </p>



<p>Importantly, this motion-induced bias completely vanished when the dots moved in the opposite direction — i.e. from the object to the face. This suggests that our brains don’t fabricate motion signals for <em>all </em>interactions between objects in our surroundings. Rather, they reserve them for the social act of inferring the connection between someone’s gaze and the object of their attention. The byproduct of this, claim the study’s authors, is the inexplicable sensation that people’s eyes emit beams of immaterial substance. And even though this takes place outside the realm of our awareness, it might just be the driving force behind extramission theories’ historic and intuitive allure.</p>



<p>One almost cannot help but wonder whether this quirk of the brain also shapes how we intuitively think about mythical creatures. Indeed, aliens and robots with so-called “<a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optic_weaponry">optic weaponry</a>” have a propensity to pop up <a href="https://screenrant.com/raised-wolves-mother-powers-eyes-explained/">in works of science fiction</a>, while medieval and classical-era tales are packed with beasts with killer glares (look no further than the <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-extremely-real-science-behind-the-basilisks-lethal-gaze/">basilisk</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Medusa/">Gorgon Medusa</a>, whose lethal gaze spurred the Greek hero Perseus to bring a reflective shield to his assassination attempt on the monster).</p>



<p>Of course, scientists will be hard pressed to prove that the historical and developmental appeal of extramission theories really is a reflection of the way our brains process gaze and attention. But these coincidences do raise interesting questions about the deep-seated role our fundamental neural mechanisms play in shaping our intuitions and imaginations — children and philosophers alike.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Chinthani Karandeni Dewage will talk about a paper "Interactions between Brassica Napus and Extracellular Fungal Pathogen Pyrenopeziza Brassicae".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology/">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></h4>

<p>Was Darwin a one-trick pony? The scientists who most praise him typically cite just one of his ideas: natural selection. Do any know that his theory of evolution—like his take on psychology—presumed all creatures were agents? This fact has long been eclipsed by the “gene’s-eye view” of adaptation which gained a strangle-hold over biology during the twentieth century—and hence over sociobiology and today’s evolutionary psychology. Are current efforts to revise this view—emphasising “new” topics like the flexibility of phenotypes (an organism’s living characteristics) and the importance of development in adaptation—simply rediscovering Darwin’s approach?</p><p>How do members of a species come to differ from each other, thus furnishing the raw material for the struggle whose results Darwin subsumed under what he called the <em>law</em> of natural selection? In two ways, wrote Darwin in 1859. A creature’s parents <em>transmit</em> different characteristics to them as starting-points for their lives. And, over their life-course, creatures <em>develop</em> their starting-characteristics in different ways, depending on how they respond to the various challenges they meet. In 1942, Julian Huxley and his colleagues recast natural selection as <em>a mechanism</em>, not a law. Imagine twinned roulette-wheels: each individual’s evolutionary fate resulted from a random genetic provision of phenotypic traits being pitted against a lottery of environmental events. This new language of genes, genomes, and (from 1953) DNA, made Darwin look ignorant about how individual differences arose. Dying before genes or DNA were discovered, he never knew that mutations and chromosome-changes caused all variations (according to Huxley).</p><p>To retain Darwin as the figurehead of this gene-first take on nature, he was retro-fitted with twentieth-century beliefs. If DNA “programmes” what creatures are and do, genetic processes drive evolution forward, not creaturely acts. Hence, Huxley asserted, the “great merit” of Darwin was his proof that living organisms never acted purposively: everything they did could be accounted for “on good mechanistic principles.” Likewise, even when Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin spoke out <em>against</em> the way the cult of genes blinds us to the active role organisms play in adaptation, his first target was Darwin, who, Lewontin said, portrayed organisms “as passive objects moulded by the external force of natural selection.”</p><p>Lewontin’s vouch that organisms help shape their own fates is now gaining traction. Few genes behave as they should according to Mendel. So, talk about genes “for” a phenotypic character is rarely appropriate. Even when we know everything we can about genes and environment, we still cannot predict what characteristics will emerge in an organism—proving phenotypes are independent sources of plasticity in the genesis of adaptations. Organisms help cause their own development and destiny, which means phenotypes themselves have evolutionary effects. Never mind why a fly hatches from its pupa to be small: its unusually big surface to volume ratio cannot help but shape its remaining life-history. This point underlines findings from biologists who study animal behaviour. Beavers build dams, chimps and crows make tools, wolves hunt better in packs. All such feats alter the evolutionary prospects of phenotypes.</p><p>Darwin’s books herald all these emphases: the distinction between transmission and development when discussing inheritance; the “plasticity of organisation” in all creatures; and, importantly here, the tie between action and structure. Darwin saw nature as a theatre of agency. The roots of cabbage seedlings successfully improvised, after Darwin experimentally blocked them from plunging straight down into the earth. Earthworms “intelligently” grasped how best to tug his artificially-shaped “leaves” to plug their holes against the cold. And when newly-arrived finches were competing for food on the Galapagos Islands, it must have been the birds who first found the best new diets—not random genetic changes—who gained reproductive supremacy and consequently, over millennia, such new bodily adaptations as the skin-piercing beak of blood-sucking Vampire Finches.</p><p>Actions produce reactions, <em>The</em> <em>Origin of Species</em> repeatedly reminds us. Which means an organism’s actions inevitably render it interdependent with its habitat, animate and inanimate. Such ties may be competitive or cooperative—“mutual aid” being the hallmark of evolution in “social animals” like us. Hence, when Darwin published his views on human agency in <em>The Descent of Man</em>—first published 150 years ago this month—and its sequel, <em>The Expression of the Emotions</em> (1872), social interdependency took pride of place. Darwin argued non-verbal expressions to be <em>purposeless</em> by-products of functional habits—we weep because we protectively close our eyes when screaming, incidentally squeezing our tear-glands. Such unintended side-effects only come to signify emotion because <em>others “</em>recognize” their meaning as linked to suffering. When I blush, my inbuilt capacity for reading expressions has rebounded, leading me to read in you how I imagine you to be reading me. Such “self-attention” underpins sexual display, plus such quintessentially human traits as language, culture, and conscience.</p><p>Go back to what Darwin wrote about evolution, and you will hear him speaking from a place that the latest biology now renders prescient. Interdependencies of agency not only forge individual differences, and winnow the kernels of inter-generational success from the chaff of failure. They also compose Darwin’s unsung creation of the first naturalistic psychology.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/sky-sunset-darwin-mangrove-horizon-2910165/">Pat Josse</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645043306/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/" rel="nofollow">Disability, access, and the virtual conference</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/family-secrets-and-the-demise-of-erard-pianos-and-harps/" rel="nofollow">Family secrets and the demise of Erard pianos and harps</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/turning-geology-into-archaeology-how-two-businessmen-changed-the-face-of-time/" rel="nofollow">Turning geology into archaeology: how two businessmen changed the face of time</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/srNfQp0KB-s/">PLOS and Yale University Announce Publishing Agreement</a></h4>

<p>Yale University posted the following announcement on its website on February 23, 2021</p>



<p>Yale University Library has signed two innovative agreements that will allow Yale-affiliated authors to publish in any PLOS open access journal without paying article processing charges (APCs).</p>



<p>PLOS is a non-profit, open access publisher of seven highly respected scientific and medical journals. Last year Yale authors published more than 100 articles in PLOS journals, with APCs of up to $3,000 per article. Effective Jan. 1, 2021, these author-paid APCs will be eliminated and replaced with annual fees paid by the library. The authors will maintain copyright ownership of their research.</p>



<p>“Our goal is to make open access publishing a more viable option for more Yale researchers in science and medicine, and to support a publication model that will also encourage open access publishing beyond Yale,” said Barbara Rockenbach, the Stephen Gates ’68 University Librarian.</p>



<p>Open access publishing has grown in popularity since the 1990s when peer-reviewed journals began publishing online with a traditional business model based on limited access and high subscription fees. Open access developed as an alternative to make new research quickly and widely available with financial support from those producing the research. However, financial support for APCs from academic departments, government, and other research funders has varied widely, with some authors having to pay from personal funds.</p>



<p>The library agreements will eliminate APCs for Yale authors publishing in PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS One, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Genetics, and PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, as well as in any new PLOS publications launched during the contract term. The initial agreements are for three years and will be funded through Yale Library’s Collection Development department with support from the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library.</p>



<p>“We are pleased that Yale Library can support this emerging, more sustainable model of open-access publishing,” Rockenbach said. “We are committed to facilitating equitable access to research in science and medicine–and the progress research fuels.”</p>

<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichieHakim/status/1363545448317878282">Richie Hakim asked</a> whether the toolbox Cascade for spike inference (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) induces temporal dispersion of the predicted spiking activity compared to ground truth. This kind of temporal dispersion had been observed in a study from last year (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198">Wei et al., PLoS Comp Biol, 2020</a>; also discussed in a previous <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/">blog post</a>), suggesting that analyses based on raw or deconvolved calcium imaging data might falsely suggest continuous sequences of neuronal activations, while the true activity patterns are coming in discrete bouts.</p>



<p>To approach this question, I used one of our 27 ground truth datasets (the one recorded for the original GCaMP6f paper). From all recordings in this data set, I detected events that exceeded a certain ground truth spike rate. Next, I assigned these extracted events in 3 groups and systematically shifted the detected event of groups 1 and 3 by 0.5 seconds forth and back. Note that this is a short shift compared to the timescale investigated by the Wei et al. paper. This is how the ground truth looks like. It is clearly not a continuous sequence of activations:</p>

<p>To evaluate whether the three-bout pattern would result in a continuous sequence after spike inference, I just used the dF/F recordings associated with above ground truth recordings and Cascade’s global model for excitatory neurons (a pretrained network that is available with the toolbox), I infered the spike rates. There is indeed some dispersion due to the difficulty to infer spike rates from noisy data. But the three bouts are very clearly visible.</p>

<p>This is even more apparent when plotting the average spike rate across neurons:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6757" data-attachment-id="6757" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="noise2_3-1" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png" data-orig-size="1340,568" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_3-1/" height="212" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=1024" width="502" /></figure></div>



<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that there are conditions and existing datasets where discrete activity bouts can be clearly distinguished from sequential activations based on spike rates inferred with Cascade.</p>



<p>This analysis was performed on neurons at a standardized noise level of 2% Hz<sup>-1</sup> (see the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint </a>for a proper definition of the standardized noise level). This is a typical and very decent noise level for population calcium imaging. However, if we perform the same analysis on the same data set but with a relatively high noise level of 8% Hz<sup>-1</sup>, the resulting predictions are indeed much more dispersed, since the dF/F patterns are too noisy to make more precise predictions. The average spike rate still shows three peaks, but they are only riding on top of a more broadly distributed, seemingly persistent increase of the spike rate.</p>

<p>Dans ce texte, j’essaie d’expliquer quelques concepts simples concernant la dynamique et le contrôle d’une épidémie. Je l’écris bien sûr en pensant à l’épidémie de Covid-19, mais la plupart des concepts sont généraux. En préambule, je tiens à préciser que je ne suis ni médecin ni épidémiologiste, donc je ne parlerai pratiquement pas des aspects purement médicaux, ni de subtilités d’épidémiologie, mais simplement de quelques notions générales. Ma spécialité est la modélisation de phénomènes dynamiques en biologie, en l’occurrence en neurosciences. Merci donc aux collègues compétents d’apporter des précisions ou corrections éventuelles, ou des références pertinentes.</p>
<p><strong>Quelques remarques préliminaires sur les statistiques</strong></p>
<p>Avant de commencer les explications, je voudrais tout d’abord inviter le lecteur à la prudence quant à l’interprétation des statistiques, en particulier des statistiques de mortalité. A l’heure où j’écris ces lignes, on estime qu’environ 15% de la population française a été infectée. Autrement dit, l’épidémie est débutante. Les statistiques de mortalité ne sont donc pas un « bilan » de l’épidémie, mais des statistiques sur une épidémie en cours. Comparer avec le bilan d’épidémies passées, ou d’autres causes de mortalité, n’a donc pas beaucoup de sens (éventuellement, on pourrait multiplier par 5 ces statistiques pour avoir un ordre d’idée).</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie ne dépend pas que du virus. Elle dépend aussi de la personne malade. Un facteur majeur est l’âge, et il faut donc prendre cela en compte lorsque l’on compare des pays de démographies très différentes. En première approximation, le risque de décès de la Covid-19 augmente avec l’âge de la même manière que le risque de décès hors Covid. On peut voir cela comme le fait que les jeunes sont peu à risque, ou bien que toutes les classes d’âge voient leur risque de décès dans l’année augmenter d’un même facteur. Quoi qu’il en soit, avec ce type de profil de mortalité, l’âge moyen ou médian au décès n’est pas très informatif puisqu’il est le même avec et sans infection.</p>
<p>Troisièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie dépend aussi de la prise en charge. En l’occurrence, la Covid-19 se caractérise par un fort taux d’hospitalisation et de réanimation. La mortalité observée en France jusqu’à présent correspond à celle d’un système de soin qui n’est pas saturé. Naturellement, elle serait bien plus élevée si l’on ne pouvait pas procurer ces soins, c’est-à-dire si l’épidémie n’était pas contrôlée, et la mortalité se déplacerait également vers une population plus jeune.</p>
<p>Enfin, il va de soi que la gravité d’une maladie ne se réduit pas à sa mortalité. Une hospitalisation n’est généralement pas anodine, et les cas moins sévères peuvent avoir des séquelles à long terme.</p>
<p><strong>Le taux de reproduction</strong></p>
<p>Un virus est une entité qui peut se répliquer dans un hôte et se transmettre à d’autres hôtes. Contrairement à une bactérie qui est une cellule, un virus n’est pas à proprement parler un organisme, c’est-à-dire qu’il dépend totalement de l’hôte pour sa survie et sa reproduction. Par conséquent, pour comprendre la dynamique d’une épidémie virale, il faut s’intéresser au nombre d’hôtes infectés et à la transmission entre hôtes.</p>
<p>Un paramètre important est le <em>taux de reproduction </em>(R). C’est le nombre moyen de personnes qu’une personne infectée va contaminer. On voit que l’épidémie se développe si R&gt;1, et s’éteint si R&lt;1. A chaque transmission, le nombre de cas est multiplié par R. Ce taux de reproduction ne dit pas à quelle vitesse l’épidémie se développe, car cela dépend du temps d’incubation et de la période de contagiosité. C’est en fait un paramètre qui est surtout intéressant pour comprendre le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, si <em>R = 2</em>, alors on peut contrôler l’épidémie en divisant par deux le nombre de ses contacts.</p>
<p>Comme le nombre de cas est multiplié par un certain facteur à chaque épisode de contamination, une épidémie a typiquement une dynamique exponentielle, c’est-à-dire que c’est le nombre de chiffres qui augmente régulièrement. Cela prend autant de temps de passer de 10 à 100 cas que de 100 à 1000 cas, ou de 1000 à 10 000 cas. La dynamique est donc de nature explosive. C’est pourquoi la quantité à suivre avec attention n’est pas tant le nombre de cas que ce taux de reproduction : dès que R&gt;1, le nombre de cas peut rapidement exploser et il faut agir vite.</p>
<p>Naturellement, ce raisonnement suppose que la population n’a pas été déjà infectée. Si une proportion <em>p</em> de la population est immunisée (infectée ou vaccinée), alors chaque personne infectée va contaminer en moyenne un nombre de personnes <em>R</em> x (1-<em>p</em>). L’épidémie va donc s’arrêter quand ce nombre descend en-dessous de 1, c’est-à-dire <em>p &gt; 1- 1/R</em>. Par exemple, avec <em>R = 3</em>, l’épidémie s’arrête quand les 2/3 de population sont immunisés.</p>
<p>Ceci nous dit également l’impact de la vaccination en cours sur le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, à l’heure où j’écris ces lignes (22 février 2021), environ 2% de la population a été vaccinée (4% a reçu la première dose). Cela contribue donc à diminuer R de 2% (par exemple de 1.1 à 1.08). Il est donc clair que la vaccination n’aura pas d’effet important sur la dynamique globale avant plusieurs mois.</p>
<p>Il est important de comprendre que ce taux de reproduction n’est pas une caractéristique intrinsèque du virus. Il dépend du virus, mais également de l’hôte qui peut être plus ou moins contagieux (on a parlé par exemple des « superspreaders »), d’aspects comportementaux, de mesures de protection (par exemple les masques). Ce taux n’est donc pas forcément homogène dans une population. Par exemple, il est vraisemblable que le R soit supérieur chez les jeunes actifs que chez les personnes âgées.</p>
<p><strong>Peut-on isoler une partie de la population ?</strong></p>
<p>Est-il possible de préserver la population la plus fragile en l’isolant du reste de la population, sans contrôler l’épidémie ? Cette hypothèse a été formulée plusieurs fois, bien que <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230">très critiquée dans la littérature scientifique</a>.</p>
<p>On peut comprendre assez facilement que c’est une idée périlleuse. Isoler une partie de la population a un impact quasi nul sur le taux de reproduction R, et donc la dynamique de l’épidémie est inchangée. Il faut bien garder à l’esprit que contrôler une épidémie pour qu’elle s’éteigne suppose simplement de faire en sorte que R&lt;1, de façon à ce que le nombre de cas décroisse exponentiellement. Ainsi pendant le confinement strict de mars 2020, le taux était d’environ R = 0.7. C’est suffisant pour que l’épidémie s’éteigne, mais il n’en reste pas moins qu’une personne infectée continue à contaminer d’autres gens. Par conséquent, à moins de parvenir à isoler ces personnes fragiles beaucoup plus strictement que lors du premier confinement (ce qui semble douteux étant donné qu’il s’agit pour partie de personnes dépendantes), l’épidémie dans cette population va suivre l’épidémie dans la population générale, avec la même dynamique mais dans une version un peu atténuée. Autrement dit, il semble peu plausible que cette stratégie soit efficace.</p>
<p><strong>Les variants</strong></p>
<p>Un virus peut muter, c’est-à-dire que lorsqu’il se réplique dans un hôte, des erreurs sont introduites de sorte que les propriétés du virus changent. Cela peut avoir un impact sur les symptômes, ou sur la contagiosité. Naturellement, plus il y a d’hôtes infectés, plus il y a de variants, c’est donc un phénomène qui survient dans des épidémies non contrôlées.</p>
<p>Supposons que R = 2 et qu’un variant ait un taux R = 4. Alors à chaque transmission, le nombre de cas du variant relatif au virus original est multiplié par 2. Au bout de 10 transmissions, le variant représente 99.9% des cas. Ceci reste vrai si des mesures restrictives réduisent la transmission (par exemple R=2/3 et R=4/3). Après ces 10 transmissions, le R global est celui du variant. Par conséquent, c’est le nombre de cas et le R du variant plus contagieux qui déterminent le nombre de cas et la dynamique à moyen terme (c’est-à-dire quelques semaines). Le nombre de cas du virus original et même le nombre de cas globaux sont essentiellement insignifiants.</p>
<p>Cela signifie que l’on peut être dans une dynamique explosive alors même que le nombre de cas diminue. Pour savoir si l’épidémie est sous contrôle, il faut regarder le R du variant le plus contagieux. A l’heure où j’écris, on est précisément dans la situation où le virus original est encore dominant avec R&lt;1 et les variants ont un R&gt;1, ce qui signifie que malgré une diminution globale des cas, on est dans une dynamique explosive qui sera apparente dans le nombre global de cas lorsque les variants seront dominants.</p>
<p><strong>Le contrôle épidémique</strong></p>
<p>Contrôler l’épidémie signifie faire en sorte que R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas diminue exponentiellement et s’approche de 0. Il ne s’agit pas nécessairement de supprimer toute transmission mais de faire en sorte par une combinaison de mesures que R soit plus petit que 1. Ainsi, passer de R = 1.1 à 0.9 suffit pour passer d’une épidémie explosive à une extinction de l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Naturellement, la mesure la plus sûre pour éteindre l’épidémie est d’empêcher toute relation sociale (le « confinement »). Mais il existe potentiellement de nombreuses autres mesures, et idéalement il s’agit de combiner plusieurs mesures à la fois efficaces et peu contraignantes, le confinement pouvant être utilisé en dernier recours lorsque ces mesures ont échoué. La difficulté est que l’impact d’une mesure n’est pas précisément connu pour un virus nouveau.</p>
<p>Ces connaissances sont cependant loin d’être négligeables après un an d’épidémie de Covid-19. On sait par exemple que le port du masque est très efficace (on s’en doutait déjà, étant donné que c’est une infection respiratoire). On sait que le virus se propage par projection de gouttelettes et par aérosols. On sait également que les écoles et les lieux de restauration collective sont des lieux importants de contamination. Cette observation peut conduire à fermer ces lieux, mais on pourrait alternativement les sécuriser par l’installation de ventilation et de filtres (investissement qui pourrait d’ailleurs être synergique avec un plan de rénovation énergétique).</p>
<p>Il y a deux grands types de mesures. Il y a des mesures globales qui s’appliquent aux personnes saines comme aux porteurs du virus, comme le port du masque, la fermeture de certains lieux, la mise en place du télétravail. Le coût de ces mesures (au sens large, c’est-à-dire le coût économique et les contraintes) est fixe. Il y a des mesures spécifiques, c’est-à-dire qui sont déclenchées lorsqu’il y a un cas, comme le traçage, la fermeture d’une école, le confinement local. Ces mesures spécifiques ont un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Le coût global est donc une combinaison d’un coût fixe et d’un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Par conséquent, il est toujours plus coûteux de maîtriser une épidémie lorsque le nombre de cas est plus grand (choix qui semble pourtant avoir été fait en France après le deuxième confinement).</p>
<p><strong>Le « plateau »</strong></p>
<p>Une remarque importante : les mesures ont un impact sur la progression de l’épidémie (R) et non directement sur le nombre de cas. Cela signifie que si l’on sait maintenir un nombre de cas haut (R=1), alors on sait tout aussi bien (avec les mêmes mesures), maintenir un nombre de cas bas. Avec un petit effort supplémentaire (R=0.9), on peut supprimer l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Avoir comme objectif la saturation hospitalière n’a donc pas particulièrement d’intérêt, et est même un choix plus coûteux que la suppression. Il existe une justification à cet objectif, la stratégie consistant à « aplatir la courbe », qui a été suggérée au début de l’épidémie. Il s’agit de maximiser le nombre de personnes infectées de façon à immuniser rapidement toute la population. Maintenant qu’il existe un vaccin, cette stratégie n’a plus beaucoup de sens. Même sans vaccin, infecter toute la population sans saturer les services hospitaliers prendrait plusieurs années, sans parler naturellement de la mortalité.</p>
<p><strong>La suppression de l’épidémie</strong></p>
<p>Comme remarqué précédemment, il est plus facile de maîtriser une épidémie faible que forte, et donc une stratégie de contrôle doit viser non un nombre de cas « acceptables », mais un taux de reproduction R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas décroît exponentiellement. Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il faut prendre en compte les cas importés. C’est-à-dire que sur une période de contamination, le nombre de cas va passer non plus de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n</em> mais de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n + </em><em>I</em>, où <em>I</em> est le nombre de cas importés. Le nombre de cas va donc se stabiliser à <em>I/(1-R)</em> (par exemple, 3 fois le nombre de cas importés si R = 2/3). Si l’on veut diminuer encore le nombre de cas, il devient alors important d’empêcher l’importation de nouveaux cas (tests, quarantaine, etc).</p>
<p>Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il devient faisable d’appliquer des mesures spécifiques très poussées, c’est-à-dire pour chaque cas. Par exemple, pour chaque cas, on isole la personne, et l’on teste et on isole toutes les personnes susceptibles d’être également porteuses. Non seulement on identifie les personnes potentiellement contaminées par la personne positive, mais on recherche également la source de la contamination. En effet, si l’épidémie est portée par des événements de supercontamination (« clusters »), alors il devient plus efficace de remonter à la source de la contamination puis de suivre les cas contacts.</p>
<p>A faible circulation, comme on dispose de ces moyens supplémentaires pour diminuer la transmission, il devient possible de lever certains moyens non spécifiques (par exemple le confinement général ou autres restrictions sociales, les fermetures d’établissements et même le port du masque). Pour que les moyens spécifiques aient un impact important, un point clé est que la majorité des cas puissent être détectés. Cela suppose des tests systématiques massifs, par exemple en utilisant des tests salivaires, des drive-in, des tests groupés, des contrôles de température. Cela suppose que les personnes positives ne soient pas découragées de se tester et s’isoler (en particulier, en maintenant les revenus). Cela suppose également un isolement systématique en attente de résultat pour les cas suspectés. Autrement dit, pour avoir une chance de fonctionner, cette stratégie doit être appliquée de manière la plus systématique possible. L’appliquer sur 10% des cas n’a pratiquement aucun intérêt. C’est pourquoi elle n’a de sens que lorsque la circulation du virus est faible.</p>
<p>Il est important d’observer que dans cette stratégie, l’essentiel du coût et des contraintes est porté par le dispositif de test, puisque le traçage et l’isolement ne se produisent que lorsqu’un cas est détecté, ce qui idéalement arrive très rarement. Si elle demande une certaine logistique, c’est en revanche une stratégie économique et peu contraignante pour la population.</p>
<p><strong>Quand agir ?</strong></p>
<p>J’ai expliqué que maintenir un niveau élevé de cas est plus coûteux et plus contraignant que maintenir un niveau faible de cas. Maintenir un niveau très faible de cas est encore moins coûteux et contraignant, bien que cela demande plus d’organisation.</p>
<p>Bien entendu, pour passer d’un plateau haut à un plateau bas, il faut que l’épidémie décroisse, et donc transitoirement appliquer des mesures importantes. Si l’épidémie n’est pas contrôlée – et je rappelle que cela est le cas dès lors qu’un variant est en croissance (R&gt;1) même si le nombre global de cas décroît – ces mesures vont devoir être appliquées à un moment donné. Quand faut-il les appliquer ? Est-il plus avantageux d’attendre le plus possible avant de le faire ?</p>
<p>Ce n’est clairement jamais le cas, car plus on attend, plus le nombre de cas augmente et donc plus les mesures restrictives devront être appliquées longtemps avant d’atteindre l’objectif de circulation faible, où des mesures plus fines (traçage) pourront prendre le relais. Cela peut sembler contre-intuitif si le nombre de cas est en décroissance mais c’est pourtant bien le cas, parce que le nombre de cas à moyen terme ne dépend que du nombre de cas du variant le plus contagieux, et non du nombre de cas global. Donc, si le variant le plus contagieux est en expansion, attendre ne fait qu’allonger la durée des mesures restrictives.</p>
<p>De combien ? Supposons que le nombre de cas du virus (le variant le plus contagieux) double chaque semaine, et que les mesures restrictives divisent le nombre de cas par 2 en une semaine. Alors attendre une semaine avant de les appliquer allongent ces mesures d’une semaine (j’insiste : allongent, et non simplement décalent). Dans l’hypothèse (plus réaliste) où les mesures sont un peu moins efficaces, chaque semaine d’attente augmente la durée des mesures d’un peu plus d’une semaine.</p>
<p>Il est donc toujours préférable d’agir dès que R&gt;1, de façon à agir le moins longtemps possible, et non pas d’attendre que le nombre de cas augmente considérablement. La seule justification possible à l’attente pourrait être une vaccination massive qui laisserait espérer une décroissance de l’épidémie par l’immunisation, ce qui n’est manifestement pas le cas dans l’immédiat.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/7QLveB8Y9KA/">How can we increase adoption of open research practices?</a></h4>

<p>This blog was written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions for PLOS.</p>



<p><em>Researchers are satisfied with their ability to share their own research data but may struggle with accessing other researchers’ data – according to PLOS research </em><a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u"><strong><em>released as a preprint this week</em></strong></a><em>. Therefore, to increase data sharing in a findable and accessible way, PLOS will focus on better integrating existing data repositories and promoting their benefits rather than creating new solutions. We also call on the scholarly publishing industry to improve journal data sharing policies to better support researchers’ needs.</em></p>



<p>PLOS has long supported Open Science with our data sharing policy. Our authors are far more likely to provide information about publicly available data compared to <a href="https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/">journals with less stringent policies</a>. But best practice for data sharing – use of data repositories – is observed in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">less than 30% of PLOS publications</a>. To help us understand if there are opportunities for new solutions to help improve adoption of best practice, we built on previous research into the frequency of problems associated with sharing research data. We investigated the <em>importance</em> researchers attach to different tasks associated with data sharing, and researchers’ <em>satisfaction</em> with their ability to complete these tasks.</p>



<p>Through a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/what-are-your-priorities-for-data-sharing/">survey conducted in 2020</a>, which received 728 completed responses, we found that tasks relating to research impact, funder policy compliance, and credit had the highest importance scores. Tasks associated with funder, journal, and institutional policy compliance – including preparation of Data Management Plans (DMPs) – received high satisfaction scores from researchers, on average.</p>



<p>52% of respondents reuse research data but the average satisfaction score for obtaining data for reuse – such as accessing data from journal articles or making requests for data from other individuals – was relatively low. Tasks associated with sharing data were rated somewhat important and respondents were reasonably well satisfied with their ability to accomplish them.</p>



<p><img height="624" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yitlUEq3MxJm9SMFMulTwu9TcLufAw66cpmaVwjgUQigSJ_s_9HgWwNur3kEyjqicTZ1h9UXHhk7m36GJmZYkaHuPEKoNgwXzAUtFS-An0pA0_r5TXKnWiL496UgLwxuhtXRemuD" width="624" /></p>



<p><strong><em>Figure:</em></strong><em> When we plot mean importance and satisfaction score, respondents were on average satisfied with their ability to complete the majority of tasks associated with Data Preparation, Data Publishing and Reuse of their own data but dissatisfied with their ability to complete tasks associated with Reuse of other researchers’ data. Tasks associated with meeting policy requirements are both important and well satisfied.</em></p>



<p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>



<p>We presume that researchers are unlikely to seek <em>new </em>solutions to a problem or task that they are satisfied in their <em>ability </em>to accomplish. This implies there are few opportunities for new solutions to meet researcher needs for data sharing – at least in our cohort, which consisted mostly of PLOS authors. PLOS – and other publishers – can likely meet these needs for data sharing by working to seamlessly integrate existing solutions that reduce the effort involved in some tasks, and focusing on advocacy and education around the benefits of sharing data in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) manner. </p>



<p>The challenges that researchers have reusing data could be addressed in part by strengthening journal data sharing policies – such as only permitting “data available on request” when there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing, and improving the links between articles and supporting datasets. Generic “data available on request” statements in publications, which are not permitted under PLOS’s policies, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011784">usually mean data will not be available</a>.</p>



<p>While our research revealed a “negative result” with respect to new solution opportunities, the results are informative for how PLOS can best meet known researcher needs. This includes more closely partnering with established data repositories and improving the linking of research data and publications. These are important parts of our plans to support adoption of Open Science in 2021 and beyond.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/sJv6yShHt28/">PLOS and Uppsala University Announce Publishing Deal</a></h4>

<p>Uppsala University and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year publishing agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). The Community Action Publishing (CAP) agreement enables Uppsala University researchers to publish fee-free in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> and<em> PLOS</em> <em>Biology. </em>The Flat fee agreement also allows them to publish in <em>PLOS ONE</em> and PLOS’ community journals<a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1">[1]</a>. These models shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be collaborating with Uppsala University, our first European flat fee customer, on two new models that allow Uppsala researchers to publish without APCs,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.  “As one of the most prestigious university’s in the world, Uppsala is well-positioned to further the cause of equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing and we are delighted to join with them on this effort.”</p>



<p>PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">here</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing">here.</a> PLOS’ Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with PLOS’ other five journals creating efficiency and reducing administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. Uppsala University and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.</p>



<p>The Uppsala University publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS, following other agreements with the University of California system, Big Ten Academic Alliance, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network among others.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology/">What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?</a></h4>

<p>One way to think of culture is as a context in which we learn and develop. We share, live, perform, and experience culture through our participation in daily activities, customs, and routines with social others. Culture helps us make sense of our social worlds and shapes our actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, culture plays a role in the way we experience emotions, construct our self-concepts, and learn and problem-solve.</p><p>With increasing migration and the movement of people in the twenty-first century, many children in the US and worldwide are attending school in formal settings where cultural norms and practices at home may conflict with those children encounter at school. This experience places children in the position of having to navigate two different social worlds—home and school. One broad question we can explore is: “what role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences and academic success?” Let’s visit three specific areas: parental beliefs and socialization practices, teacher perceptions, and school curricula and children’s learning.</p><h2>Parental beliefs and socialization practices</h2><p>Parental expectations, beliefs, and attitudes about education shape children’s academic experiences. Many parents in diverse cultural communities view education as a path to future success. For example, as a group many Asian and Asian American children attain academic success. What role does culture play in these outcomes? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=l4wwBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Understanding+Taiwanese+children%E2%80%99s+play+via+constructing+and+reconstructing:+a+prospective+vision&amp;ots=s3ofAeiKoG&amp;sig=ocrn2krrERVpHnGg2WA_A4j09bI#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Taiwanese%20children%E2%80%99s%20play%20via%20constructing%20and%20reconstructing%3A%20a%20prospective%20vision&amp;f=false">Chang</a> notes that as a group, Chinese and Taiwanese parents place a high value on education. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590544000068">Kim and Park</a>  note the same is true for Korean parents. Parenting approaches in these communities highlight training and disciplining children, parent self-sacrifice, and devotion to children. Parents believe perseverance and hard work is the key to success and socialization practices reinforce these values and traits. These cultural practices help children internalize the values their parents place upon education and behaving according to social norms. Children acquire these values and are loyal, appreciative, and dedicated to their parents for their support and encouragement. In part, they attain academic success to honor their parents and the broader social groups to which they belong.</p><h2>Teacher perceptions</h2><p>Teachers play an important role in children’s academic success too. What practices work best to motivate children to do well at school? The answer depends upon numerous factors. For example, many teachers will be entrusted with educating children who may not share their cultural heritage. How might this cultural mismatch shape children’s school experiences and potential for academic success?</p><p>Most American school practices reflect dominant, mainstream American values, norms, and behavioral scripts. For most European American children who value independence and uniqueness, teacher praise and rewards can be highly motivating. However, for children who come from families that value humility and modesty, receiving praise in front of classmates might be an uncomfortable interaction.</p><p>Student engagement norms are another example. Many American teachers using a mainstream cultural lens, connect active student engagement with student attentiveness. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/331021">Yamamoto and Li</a>noted that for many Asian and Asian American students, knowing when to be quiet is a desirable skill which caregivers socialize their children to acquire. Teachers using mainstream, American cultural values and norms may perceive quiet students as disengaged and inattentive. These perceptions impact children’s motivation to learn and academic success.</p><h2>School curricula and children’s learning</h2><p>Dominant, mainstream American values tend to permeate curricular and teaching practices. Many American schools promote individual learning and problem-solving approaches rather than group or collaborative problem-solving strategies. The focus upon individualized learning connects to the cultural ideology of individualism and the independent self. These approaches promote the self as separate and unique from social others. Many European American children participate in cultural practices and routines that reinforce this worldview and values.</p><p>However, many Latinx and indigenous children participate in cultural practices and activities at home that value group and collaborative problem solving. These practices connect to the cultural ideology of collectivism and the interdependent self. At home children participate in practices and routines that emphasize the importance of the group, especially family. Thus, there is a disconnect between the approaches at home with the practices and routines the child encounters at school. Consequently, many of these children often have difficulty reaching their maximum potential in classrooms that promote individual problem-solving skills. Why does this happen and does this necessarily have be the outcome?</p><p>For many children from cultural heritages that promote collectivist values and an interdependent cultural model of the self, the cultural practices in which the child participates at home may conflict with those the child encounters at school. Often, teachers are unaware of these sources of conflict. However, this conflict between home and school does not need to impede students’ success or invalidate the child’s cultural heritage. One solution is for schools to meet students halfway and bridge the gap between the two contexts.</p><p>Two fine examples are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/resources/bridging-cultures-in-our-schools-new-approaches-that-work-knowledge-brief/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a> designed to assist immigrant and indigenous children in the US and the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351237109/chapters/10.4324/9781351237109-2">Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP)</a> designed to assist native Hawaiian children. Both programs highlight how helping teachers become more aware, respectful, accepting, and inclusive of all their students’ cultural values and goals shapes children’s motivation and academic success at school.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Numerous cultural forces connect to children’s school experiences and academic achievement. These include parental beliefs, socialization practices, and cultural worldviews. Cultural values, practices, and ways of learning at home both shape and connect to children’s formal school experiences. Educational initiatives such as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/project/bridging-cultures-project/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a>  and KEEP highlight the importance of cultural compatibility and connectedness in fostering children’s active engagement in school. Acknowledging and incorporating cultural knowledge, patterns, and ways of learning at home when they disconnect with those at school is one important way to ensure all children’s academic success.</p><p><em>Featured image: School children in India, by Richard Veit</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/what-role-does-culture-play-in-shaping-childrens-school-experiences/">What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/644350254/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/the-librarian-reserve-corps-fighting-covid-19-with-mediated-information/" rel="nofollow">The Librarian Reserve Corps: fighting COVID-19 with mediated information</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/addressing-health-inequity-in-disparities-of-cancer-outcomes/" rel="nofollow">Addressing health inequity in disparities of cancer outcomes</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/" rel="nofollow">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Tracking disease outbreaks is key to combating them, and predicting epidemics can help direct prevention measures most effectively. Google Trends has been used to track and/or predict the spread of infections diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and AIDS.</p>
<p>This study extended these analyses to measles, a highly infectious disease causing outbreaks around the world, by comparing official data on measles in Europe to data from Google Trends.</p>
<p>The authors found that the prediction model generated from the Google Trends data overall closely matched the data on actual cases. The prediction was more accurate for countries that had higher measles activity. One advantage of using data from Google trends to track and predict disease outbreaks is that the data are available almost in real time, in contrast to official data that often take months to be released. This could help with faster responses to contain the spread of the illness.</p>

Growth factor therapy can promote angiogenesis to treat DCM, but delivery of the therapy has proven difficult.</p>
<p>The authors of this study tested ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in rats with DCM as a potential safe and effective way to stimulate angiogenesis in the heart.</p>
<p>They found that UTMD used with Sonovue microbubbles restored heart function in the rats who received the treatment. Histology and microscopy showed that much of the damage to the heart tissue seen in the DCM rats had been reversed by the treatment. This new technique shows promise as a noninvasive therapy for early intervention of DCM in diabetic patients.</p>

<p>Babies born at either end of the birthweight bell curve are at higher risk of neonatal complications such as respiratory distress or NICU admission, but determining the cut-off precentile for considering a newborn at risk depends on a range of factors. Different standards account for these factors differently, leading to discrepancies in identifying babies at risk. Maternal diabetes is one of the factors that affect both a newborn’s birthweight and their risk of complications.</p>
<p>A new study has applied three widely-used growth standards to a large, international cohort of babies born to mothers with diabetes. Birthweight percentiles were calculated using each of the standards and then predicted risk of complications based on those percentiles was compared with actual outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that one of the growth standards, which did not account for gestational age at birth, was not suitable for risk assessment of babies born to mothers with diabetes, while the other two showed high associations between cut-offs for large- and small-for-gestational-age and rates of complications.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12282 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_141571612-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Falling is a serious risk for older adults, and falls-prevention exercise interventions have shown good results in preventing falls in the short-term. However, little is known about the long-term effects of these interventions and whether they produce ongoing changes in the exercise behaviors of the participants.</p>
<p>To fill in these gaps, the authors of this study interviewed older adults who had participated in a fall-prevention exercise trial about their experiences in the trial and their exercise activities and falls after the conclusion of the trial.</p>
<p>The participants described maintaining physical activity since the conclusion of the trial, but very few continued with the exercises they had learned in the intervention. Many of the participants minimized the seriousness of falls they had experienced. These interviews highlighted that the challenges in encouraging older adults to continue with falls-prevention exercises after the conclusion of an intervention are similar to the challenges in convincing them to participate in the interventions in the first place. Those working with older adults need to understand individual needs and habits and to contextualize the importance of fall prevention within each individual’s own priorities for maintaining health and independence.</p>

<blockquote><p>These clear guidelines will allow authors … to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta-ethnography, the synthesis of multiple qualitative studies, can provide insights into the experiences of patients and health-care professionals and generate evidence that can be used to inform healthcare practice and policy. However, there are not yet clear guidelines on the process of meta-ethnography.</p>
<p>To address this, the authors of a new paper have designed a step-by-step method for conducting a meta-ethnography, including examples. They especially focused on the middle and later stages of the process, “determining how the studies are related, translating the studies into one another, synthesising the translations,” due to the difficulty of these steps and the dearth of existing guidance for conducting them.</p>
<p>These clear guidelines will allow authors of future meta-ethnographies, even those new to the methodology, to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses of evidence that contribute to improvements in patient care and healthcare processes.</p>

<p>Subscribers to arXiv’s daily email announcement recently experienced a disruption in service. Maintenance performed by arXiv’s email provider was found to be the cause of the disruption. The issue has been resolved, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>During this time, functionality on arXiv.org remained intact. Readers and authors could continue to browse and download new papers on arXiv.org, as well as submit their own articles.</p>
<p><b>The issue</b></p>
<p>Daily emails announcing new papers were received late, or not at all. Other emails, such as account registration confirmations, were also affected.</p>
<p><b>The response</b></p>
<p>We first identified and fixed a problem related to the email disruption, and began sending the email backlog to subscribers. Soon after that process began, another issue was identified that inadvertently truncated subscriber lists, specific to several subject areas. Finally, the distribution lists for all subject areas were restored and remaining announcements were sent.</p>
<p>Moving forward, if any subscribers find that the daily announcement email is not received, we advise them <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">to resubscribe</a>.</p>
<p><b>Remediation </b></p>
<p>We know that researchers rely on the daily announcement for their work, and we aim to avoid such disruptions in the future by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automating daily backups of the distribution lists</li>
<li>Applying fixes to prevent the root cause</li>
<li>Improving the monitoring of the daily email announcement systems</li>
<li>Reviewing our overall backup and recovery plans</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we resolved the issue and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

<p><em>A message to the community from the Directors of the Institutes, Centers, and Offices involved in the NIH BRAIN Initiative and NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. </em></p>
<p><span id="more-3042"></span></p>
<p><em>NINDS Director Walter J. Koroshetz, NIMH Director Joshua A. Gordon, NIA Director Richard Hodes, NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, NICHD Director Diana W. Bianchi, NEI Director Michael F. Chiang, NIDCR Director Rena D’Souza, NIAAA Director George F. Koob, NCCIH Director Helene Langevin, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director John J. Ngai, OBSSR Director William T. Riley, NIBIB Director Bruce J. Tromberg, NIDCD Director Debara L. Tucci, NIEHS Director Rick Woychik, NINR Director Shannon N. Zenk</em></p>
<p>Inherent in the mission of NIH is that biomedical research and its application can and should benefit all people. Significant events across our nation over the past year and frank discussions in the research community have led to deep reflection at NIH about biases and disparities faced by underrepresented groups in the research enterprise. As we strive to recognize our own role in these challenges, we <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html">affirm our commitment to diversity</a> and to positive change to eliminate racism in our community and in our organization.</p>
<p>As a step towards that change, the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that are part of the <a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/">NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</a> and <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/">the NIH BRAIN Initiative</a>, strongly encourage the neuroscience community to take advantage of the new NIH-wide <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/first">Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program</a>, supported by the NIH Common Fund. Although progress has been made to increase participation of historically underrepresented groups in biomedical training stages, members of these groups are still less likely to be hired into positions as independently funded faculty researchers. These populations include underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women.</p>
<p>To help address this disparity, the FIRST program aims to enhance cultures of inclusive excellence through institutional support for recruitment of diverse “cohorts” of early-stage research faculty. Here, “inclusive excellence” describes the cultivation of scientific environments that can engage and benefit from a full range of talent. Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research. We want the FIRST program to enable researchers to thrive, and we believe the broader neuroscience community has much to gain. Indeed, the growing field of the <a href="https://diversity.nih.gov/find-read-learn/diversity-research-articles">Science of Diversity</a> shows the positive impacts that result when heterogeneous teams apply diverse perspectives and expertise to research challenges. We are hopeful that the cohort hiring model in FIRST will succeed in turning the culture in neuroscience departments and their institutions toward greater inclusion and diversity. We fully recognize that there are structural barriers perpetuated by gaps and that critical improvements must be made, because <a href="https://neuronline.sfn.org/diversity/fostering-diversity-and-inclusion-in-neuroscience-faculty">many groups are severely underrepresented in neuroscience</a>. To our neuroscientists: we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity as a path to meaningful change. We are committed to fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse neuroscience community, and the FIRST program is a step in the right direction, with many, many more steps to come.</p>
<p>The objectives of the FIRST program are twofold: to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-022.html">support institutions in hiring diverse cohort</a>s of early stage research faculty; and to transform culture at NIH-funded extramural institutions by building a community of scientists who are committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. In addition to funds for hiring, the program will support new and strengthened institution-wide approaches to facilitating the success of cohort members and future faculty from diverse backgrounds. For cohort members, this is likely to include mentoring, sponsorship, and networking opportunities. For institutions, this may include training faculty in approaches known to foster inclusive excellence and changing the rubric for interviewing processes. The FIRST program will also <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-023.html">fund a coordination and evaluation center</a>, which will develop and guide the collection of common data metrics to rigorously assess the effects of FIRST faculty cohorts and institutional activities on the research culture at funded institutions. Lessons learned by these institutions will be shared with the broader biomedical research community.</p>
<p>The FIRST program is expected to fund 12 awards over the next three years, plus the coordination and evaluation center, with an estimated budget of $241M over nine years, contingent upon the availability of funds. The first receipt date for the program’s funding opportunities is <strong>March 1, 2021. </strong>For more information, please also view the recent <a href="https://nci.rev.vbrick.com/#/events/a3aee724-a9e7-45fd-ba2d-bef6ca56de9f">technical assistance webinar</a>.</p>

<p>En hel dag, med några korta pauser, tog det att presentera grundpelare och huvudteman för det nya ramprogrammet för EU-forskning, Horisont Europa (#HorizonEurope). Presentationen arrangerades gemensamt av 6 stora svenska finansiärer; Energimyndigheten, FORMAS, Forte, Rymdstryrelsen, Vetenskapsrådet, och Vinnova. Många bra presentationer och panelsamtal! Jag har summerat det hela <a data-id="https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp" data-type="URL" href="https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp">i tweets här</a>, men det finns en del att lyfta upp som inte ryms i kortfattade meningar.</p>



<p>Öppen vetenskap nämndes EN gång (av John Tumpane, från FORMAS). Data-delning nämndes inte alls. Samverkan däremot nämndes upprepade gånger, framför allt med fokus på industrin. Standarder nämndes i förbifarten, framför allt som något viktigt för industrin att bevaka och delta i utvecklandet av.</p>



<p>Mycket av fokus låg på “partnerships”, arrangerade och finansierade strategiska multi-partssamarbeten som är menade att ge garanterad förutsägbar nytta. Hela 50% av budgeten går dit. Partnerships är inte nya för EU, men det utökade fokuset på nytta är en lite ändrad inriktning.</p>



<p>En nyhet för det här ramprogrammet är “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en">missions</a>“, övergripande målbilder som ska vara förankrade i samhällsbehov och ge samhällsnytta, och göra det lättare att nå målen för the European Green Deal och Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan såväl som hållbarhetsmålen.</p>



<p>Forskningsinfrastrukturer nämndes en hel del i början av samtalet (det är en av pelarna), och får en hyfsad andel av budgeten, men var inte särskilt närvarande när det kom till samverkans-diskussionen (där jag tycker de absolut passar in).</p>



<p>Regioner nämndes som möjliga innovationshubbar och koordinatorer, vilket var en trevlig ny vinkel – tidigare har jag mest hört regioner nämnas som trösklar och fragmentering, och ett problem för det svenska Life Science-ekosystemet.</p>



<p>Universitet nämndes i början – när vikten av rätt utbildning och mobilitet i utbildning diskuterades – men inte explicit i senare diskussioner om samverkan; där låg fokus mest på individuella forskare och på industrin. Universitet borde rimligen också vara nyckelmedlemmar i samverkansprojekt.</p>



<p>Två viktiga gap (”valleys of death”) i kunskapsöverföring och nyttogörande  nämndes: den slingrande vägen  som krävs för att ta forskning från labbet till industrin, och svårigheten att skala upp innovativa start-ups på ett hållbart sätt.</p>



<p>Regeringen håller på och arbetar ut en nationell strategi för Sveriges deltagande i Horisont Europa, det är dock ännu oklart exakt när den kommer vara klar. Det ska bli intressant att se vad den innehåller; EU-ansökningar anses allmänt vara tunga, arbetskrävande och komplicerade. Stödbidrag för att frigöra tid att sätta ihop en ansökan vore kanske användbart. Utökat stöd från universitetens administratörer och Grant Offices också. (När jag jobbade med mitt första EU-projekt hade vi en EU-kunnig administratör till hjälp, och vilken <em>skillnad</em> det gjorde). </p>



<p>Tydligen hade Norge sin motsvarande presentation <a data-id="https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0" data-type="URL" href="https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0">redan i höstas</a>.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a paper "Packaging Life: The Origin of Ion-Selective Channels".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Most articles dealing with early life focus on its chemical basis and the
evolution of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic products. This essay,
however, is concerned primarily with the energy required to produce and
maintain the essential life chemicals, and the necessity to confine them in a
cell where they can function cooperatively. It seems likely that life evolved
in proximity to the undersea vents discovered by the submersible craft Alvin
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (Woods Hole, MA). Bacteria were
probably the original life form, growing in mats near the vents. Some
advantages of the vents as starting points for life are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plentiful water and essential ions. We are ~60% salt water.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Plenty of chemical elements, many out of equilibrium and ready to
combine. From one point of view, chemistry is simply the search of
electrons, e.g., the two around a hydrogen molecule, for vacancies
as close as possible to a nucleus with many protons, e.g., oxygen,
or less avid electron gatherers, e.g., nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, or
phosphorus. Eighteen of the 20 AAs contain only hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; and the remaining two require sulfur in
addition. DNA and RNA require, in addition, phosphorus. In short, it
is not necessary to dip far into the periodic table to make most of
the life chemicals.</p>
<p>3. Energy can be derived from combining chemicals issuing from the vent, as
in a fuel cell, which derives energy by passing electrons from
hydrogen to oxygen.</p>
<p>4. The water near a vent is warm, speeding experiments in the evolution of
life chemicals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given these essentials, it is easy to imagine that life developed over a period
of time, say a billion years. J. D. Sutherland, who first succeeded in
synthesizing RNA, was quoted as saying: ‘‘My assumption is that we are here on
this planet as a fundamental consequence of organic chemistry.So it must be
chemistry that wants to work’’ (1). This essay starts at the point where early
chemistry has done its work. It deals with the packaging of the life chemicals,
the problems that arise from packaging, and energy production.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/RJi5ZkUCO8M/">Exploring code notebooks through community focused collaboration</a></h4>

<h6><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader</em>, PLOS’ Open Research Manager</h6>



<p>The lack of reproducibility of research findings is a continuing concern in modern science.  Code reproducibility is a central part of the problem and we have been exploring code notebooks as one potential solution. We need to understand if these are of value to our community, both readers and authors of computational research, and are asking the computational research community to <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey">share their views</a> on the most important aspects of sharing code.</p>



<h2>Collaborating on code </h2>



<p>We have been exploring opportunities for collaboration with community-focused tools, such as code notebooks, that can improve open, reproducible research practices. PLOS Computational Biology is investigating how we can improve the reproducibility of computational articles in collaboration with <a href="https://www.neurolibre.com/">NeuroLibre</a>, a Canadian-based open science group supported by the <a href="https://conp.ca/">Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a>. Code notebooks are documents that contain code, the dependencies needed to run the code and reader friendly text elements, such as paragraphs of text explaining the purpose of the code block and figure captions. These notebooks can be made interactive through the ability to change parameters in figures or edit the code itself.  Notebooks improve open science practices by removing barriers faced by researchers who try to access others’ code, such as setting up the correct environment to run the code, making it simpler to interrogate code underlying the figures in a paper by presenting the code, the resulting analyses and accompanying text in a browser-based notebook. The Computational Biology community is a  logical place to explore how valuable these are since the community already shows high engagement with making code accessible, although primarily via repositories<sup>1</sup>.</p>



<p>NeuroLibre has created prototype versions of code notebooks for two published PLOS Computational Biology articles. They took the code and data that were shared with the articles and turned them into browser-based notebooks that display the figures, with the ability to switch to view the code or to view a Jupyter notebook (hosted on <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>). While a base level of interactivity can be created without input from the papers’ authors, the NeuroLibre team worked with <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html">one of the papers</a>’ authors to create additional interactive figures. These extra features  allow readers to manipulate the underlying data in a different way thanks to author input, such as <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/03Code/Fig3_final.html">choosing intermediate sample sizes</a> as opposed to the three sample sizes detailed in the published paper.</p>

The sample size in the interactive plot can be changed using the dropdown box to the top left of the plot.</p>



<h2>What are we up to?</h2>



<p>Our collaboration with NeuroLibre to date has focused on gathering qualitative user feedback on the prototypes, to understand  the value of these notebooks to computational biology researchers. A series of seven initial interviews helped us to better understand how researchers currently manage and share their code, how and why they access other peoples’ code, and if we are asking the right questions about notebooks. Amongst other things, we are interested in hearing what aspects of publishing reproducible research researchers value the most, what challenges they encounter, and what considerations there are for creating an interactive notebook alongside a published paper. Informed by the outcomes of this initial research, we are now looking for more researchers to share their views on these prototypes via an online questionnaire. This will serve as useful feedback for NeuroLibre to continue improving their tools, and support PLOS in working towards improving reproducibility in research publishing, in collaboration with the scientific community. <br />If you work in computational biology related research, please <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey">share your views</a>! Anonymous results of the survey will be made available in the future.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/obese-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We have several anti-smoking policies in the UK in recent decades – the bans on indoor/workplace smoking, tobacco adverts around sports, and tobacco sales in vending machines, to name a few. Indeed, smoking has been the major target of public health interventions, and rightfully so given that it made the largest contribution to avoidable deaths. These public health interventions have been quite successful and, as a result, the number of smokers has been decreasing over the past 20 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, while smoking became less popular, we had more people with obesity. In 2003, 23% of people in England had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and the number rises to 29% in 2017. Similar trends can also be observed in other nations in the UK. With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.</p>
<p>We answered this question in our research by synthesizing two sets of numbers. The first set is the yearly proportions of people with different levels of obesity, and those of current, former, and never smokers. We extracted these numbers from the Health Surveys for England and Scottish Health Surveys. These surveys recruited random samples of people in England and Scotland, making their findings more representative.</p>
<p>The second set of numbers is what we called the risk ratios of obesity and smoking. Risk ratios quantify to which extent people with obesity and smokers are at higher risk of adverse health events, such as death. We extracted risk ratios from the latest meta-analysis studies, which should provide more robust estimates.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12249" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12249" height="250" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/picblog-300x250.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Frederick K Ho et. al BMC Public Health</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Combining these two sets of numbers, we found that smoking contributed 23% of all deaths in 2003, and that number decreased to 19% in 2017 (Figure). Meanwhile obesity contributed 18% deaths in 2003 and that number increased to 23% in 2017. The contribution of obesity exceeded that of smoking in 2013. The general trends were consistent across age, sex, and education level. But for younger people under 45 years of age, smoking remained the larger contributor to deaths.</p>
<p>It should, however, be noted that the analysis assumed the risk ratios could accurately reflect the extent to which obesity and smoking causes death over the 15 years. In addition, our study only considered deaths, but the impact of obesity and smoking extends to chronic illnesses and disabilities. The legacy of smoking, such as vaping, electronic cigarettes, and passive smoking, have also not been accounted for. These can be further investigated when better and more recent data are available.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking</p></blockquote>
<p>Historical efforts to protect the public from the harms of smoking have been successful. Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking, which highlights the need to focus our efforts to address it. This could include government policies and legislation to create an environment that can facilitate weight management, as well as interventions to support individuals.</p>

<p>I wrote a book!</p>



<p>As some of you may know, in summer of 2018 I signed a contract with <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/non-fiction/popular-science/">Bloomsbury Sigma</a> to write a book about my area of research: computational neuroscience. </p>



<p>Though the term has many definitions, computational neuroscience is mainly about applying mathematics to the study of the brain. The brain—a jumble of all different kinds of neurons interconnected in countless ways that somehow produce consciousness—has been described as “the most complex object in the known universe”. Physicists for centuries have turned to mathematics to properly explain some of the most seemingly simple processes in the universe—how objects fall, how water flows, how the planets move. Equations have proved crucial in these endeavors because they capture relationships and make precise predictions possible.<strong> How could we expect to understand the most complex object in the universe without turning to mathematics? </strong></p>



<p>The answer is we can’t, and that is why I wrote this book. While I’ve been studying and working in the field for over a decade, most people I encounter have no idea what “computational neuroscience” is or that it even exists. Yet a desire to understand how the brain works is a common and very human interest. I wrote this book to let people in on the ways in which the brain will ultimately be understood: through mathematical and computational theories.   </p>



<p>At the same time, I know that both mathematics and brain science are on their own intimidating topics to the average reader and may seem downright prohibitory when put together. That is why I’ve avoided (many) equations in the book and focused instead on the driving reasons why scientists have turned to mathematical modeling, what these models have taught us about the brain, and how some surprising interactions between biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers over centuries have laid the groundwork for the future of neuroscience.  </p>



<p>Each chapter of <em>Models of the Mind</em> covers a separate topic in neuroscience, starting from individual neurons themselves and building up to the different populations of neurons and brain regions that support memory, vision, movement and more. These chapters document the history of how mathematics has woven its way into biology and the exciting advances this collaboration has in store. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/U-E1ciB2N64/">Submit your Lab and Study Protocols to PLOS ONE!</a></h4>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em>’s array of publication options that push the boundaries of Open Science continues to expand. We’re happy to announce two new article types that improve reproducibility and transparency, and allow researchers to receive credit for their contributions to study design: <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/"><strong>Lab Protocols </strong>and <strong>Study Protocols</strong></a>. </p>



<p>These new article types complement other Open Science developments at <em>PLOS ONE</em>, such as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/01/submit-your-registered-report-to-plos-one/">Registered Reports</a>, and support PLOS’ mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine. Adding reliable and accessible methods that can be built upon to the scientific record, Lab and Study Protocols support robust, reproducible science.  As reproducible science helps accelerate discoveries, such contributions deserve notice. </p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Study Protocols</strong></h5>



<p>Consisting of a single article published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, Study Protocols describe detailed plans and proposals for research projects that have not yet generated results. Sharing a study’s design and analysis plan before the research is conducted improves research quality by reducing the potential for bias, and credits researchers for the work that occurs prior to data collection. Additionally, studies that were peer reviewed as part of the funding process can be eligible for expedited publication. </p>



<p>Already well-established in health-related fields, we’re opening the format to the natural sciences, medicine, and engineering, as well as the related social sciences and humanities. In fact, both Lab and Study Protocols are open to submissions within <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s inclusive <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information#loc-scope">scope</a>, and are subject to our normal <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">publication criteria</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Lab and Study Protocols from <em>PLOS ONE</em> provide new opportunities for researchers to gain more recognition for the work that goes into contributing detailed methods.</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplos.io%2FProtocolsIsHere&amp;text=Lab%20and%20Study%20Protocols%20from%20@PLOSONE%20provide%20new%20opportunities%20for%20researchers%20to%20gain%20more%20recognition%20for%20the%20work%20that%20goes%20into%20contributing%20detailed%20methods.&amp;hashtags=PLOSProtocols">Share on Twitter! </a></cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Lab Protocols</strong></h5>



<p>Developed with researchers and in partnership with the <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a> team, Lab Protocols consist of two interlinked components that together describe <em>verified</em>, reusable methods:</p>



<ol><li>A step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts. </li></ol><ol start="2"><li>A peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sample datasets and sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. </li></ol><p>This two-part setup provides the best of both worlds for authors: the detailed, step-by-step guidance is held on protocol.io’s flexible open access platform, and the article in <em>PLOS ONE </em>helps increase the visibility and discoverability of the protocol by making it an official part of the peer-reviewed publication record. The partnership with protocols.io supports authors by clearly communicating technical details in a user-friendly format to support reproducibility. </p>



<p>Access from the PLOS ONE article to protocols.io is seamless, via uniquely-created and clearly marked features of both platforms. The protocol and accompanying article are peer reviewed by subject experts. The method described in a Lab Protocol must have been shown to work in at least one peer-reviewed publication, so readers can be confident that the Lab Protocol will work as described.</p>



<p>Lab Protocols are now open to submissions reporting verified methodologies and computational techniques.</p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>What does it look like? </strong></h5>



<p>The protocol on protocols.io and the article on <em>PLOS ONE</em> work together to communicate details required to reproduce a study.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18683" height="1020" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/2021-02-08-14_57_29-PLOS-Protocols-PLOS-1024x1020.png" width="1024" /></figure><p>On the left is the protocol on protocols.io. With the details—steps—of the protocol portrayed through interactive features and special tools, authors can effectively communicate complicated lab instructions. On the right is the <em>PLOS ONE</em> article, providing context, assurance of peer review, and increased visibility for the protocol. Both elements of a Lab Protocol will be interlinked and available simultaneously, with peer review of both organised by <em>PLOS ONE</em> and its community of Academic Editors.</p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Continuing to improve methods papers</strong></h5>



<p>Thanks to our partnership with protocols.io, we’re able to offer authors enhanced functionality to share their protocols alongside the features from a peer-reviewed publication. We believe that researchers will really benefit from the dynamic functionality that protocols.io provides, helping pave the way for improved methods papers and increased reproducibility across disciplines. </p>



<p>To help those who are trying protocols.io for the first time, authors of Lab Protocols at <em>PLOS ONE </em>can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols">upload and format their protocols</a> as part of the publication process in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

<p>Note: The Copyright Clearance Center issued the following press release on their<a href="https://www.copyright.com/plos-adopts-copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-to-manage-new-community-action-publishing-model/"> site </a>earlier today</p>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">The Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) announced today it is using <a href="http://www.copyright.com/publishers/rightslink-scientific/">RightsLink® for Scientific Communications</a> (RLSC) to manage its <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> (CAP) model, which aims to eliminate author APCs in order to make  its OA journals truly Open to Read and Open to Publish.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/"><em>PLOS Medicine</em></a> are the first PLOS journals live on RLSC, the comprehensive scholarly communications workflow solution from <a href="http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.</a> (CCC), a leader in advancing copyright, accelerating knowledge, and powering innovation.</p>



<p>RLSC is used by PLOS to deliver a flexible, sophisticated workflow that enables authors to easily publish OA, whether or not they are funded under a formal PLOS publishing agreement. PLOS can also leverage the agreement management capabilities of RLSC to support emerging OA models such as the University of California multi-payer model, where the university and author share responsibility for funding APCs.</p>



<p>“We want to ensure all authors have the same freedom in choosing the best venue for their research,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “PLOS’ Community Action Publishing changes the way we think about selectivity and authorship for a more equitable OA future. Key to this is a friction-free author experiences that reduces the lift for authors around managing payments. RLSC has been critical to facilitating this.”</p>



<p>“We’re so pleased PLOS chose RLSC to support its new CAP model by automating the management, collection, and funding of manuscripts,” said Emily Sheahan, Vice President and Managing Director, Information and Content Services, CCC.  “In partnering with PLOS on this important initiative, CCC helps provide the scale and automation required to support the needs of a growing community of stakeholders.”</p>



<p>PLOS recently entered into agreements with the <a href="https://www.btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/home">Canadian Research Knowledge Network</a>,  premier higher education consortiums of top-tier research institutions in North America, for its members to participate in the CAP program.</p>



<p>CCC just <a href="https://www.copyright.com/copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-increases-awareness-of-available-open-access-publication-funding-upon-manuscript-submission/">announced</a> new functionality for RLSC, including a capability to inform authors of available OA publication funding throughout the manuscript lifecycle, starting with submission.</p>



<p>RLSC enables publishers, funders and institutions to support a variety of OA agreements. It accelerates the implementation of OA deals, including Read and Publish Agreements, Membership Deals, and more. Over 30 publishers rely on CCC’s sophisticated agreement management solution to serve over 800 global academic institutions, consortia, and funders – including <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>, <a href="https://www.mpg.de/en">Max Planck</a> and <a href="https://cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a>. CCC’s <a href="http://www.copyright.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Open-Access-Workflow-Services_Service-Sheet_November-2020.pdf">Open Access Workflow Services</a>, a comprehensive consulting practice providing strategic OA institutional agreement workflow support, helps organizations deliver on each agreement’s unique needs.</p>



<p>CCC is an active partner in the information industry’s evolution of hybrid and pure Open Access publishing models. For years CCC has brought together key Open Access stakeholders from the author, publisher, institution, funding, and vendor communities through roundtables, panel events, webinars, podcasts, and published pieces. CCC is a member of <a href="https://oaspa.org/">OASPA</a> (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">ALPSP</a> (Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers), <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/">STM</a> (International Association of STM Publishers) and <a href="https://www.sspnet.org/">SSP</a> (Society for Scholarly Publishing).</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">Member institutions</a> now have <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage">a new way to view their arXiv usage data</a>. On arXiv.org, the number of downloads by institution is provided in searchable tables and graphs.</p>
<p>Universities, libraries, and research institutes want to support the platforms, tools, and resources that are most valuable to their constituents. By providing various types of <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage">usage statistics</a>, arXiv aims to help members and other stakeholders understand arXiv’s value, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_886" style="width: 974px;"><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage"><img alt="Screenshot of institutional downloads by subject area" class="wp-image-886 size-full" height="847" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/AccessDownloadStats-1.png" width="974" /></a>Institutions can now view their usage statistics this way. To search for a specific domain, hover over the area designated with the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>To download your institution’s data, you can select the institution or domain of interest, then click download, as indicated by the purple arrows in the screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_909" style="width: 945px;"><img alt="Screenshot of member downloads with arrows to download function" class="wp-image-909 size-full" height="386" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Member-Downloads-Tableau-Screen-Shot-2021-02-09.png" width="945" />To download the data, select the url or institution of interest, then click “download,” as indicated by the purple arrows in this screenshot.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>As our community knows, arXiv is open, above all. Readers can access articles without logging in. Authors need only meet minimal requirements to submit articles. This central tenet of openness makes measuring usage by specific communities challenging. The usage presented in the new format is compiled from data based on institutional domains and IP address ranges, and it does have limitations. For example, most people access arXiv from locations other than their research libraries. Providing new ways to view usage data is an ongoing process and feedback is always welcome at <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>arXiv’s 243 members and affiliates worldwide support the organization by contributing about 25% of the operating budget, fulfilling the Simons Foundation matching funds requirement, and contributing to governance through the Member Advisory Board. If your institution is a member, thank you! For organizations that are not yet members, we encourage you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">learn more about membership</a> and consider supporting arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>

It also thanks the donor organizations and institutional members that support our mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>
<p>This year’s report differs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports">past updates and reports</a> in that it combines the year in review and the budget into a single document. arXiv values transparency, and with this new format, we aim to keep the community well-informed about our activities. We hope you’ll take a look.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/calories-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nutrition labeling is an effective tool used by manufacturers and retailers to improve the public health, and its framework has been of importance to governments and policy makers. The front of pack nutrition labeling is part of United Kingdom government`s program of activities aiming to tackle diet-related diseases. There are several front of pack labeling formats available and they differ in the information they deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>Five hundred food products in five categories [(1) cereals and cereal products, (2) dairy products, (3) beverages, (4) packaged meats and meat products, and (5) pre-packaged fruits and vegetables] from three main United Kingdom retail websites were investigated. A simple random sampling method was used for product selection and, the types of the front of pack labels and levels of healthiness of the foods were assessed.</p>
<p><em>Dominant front of pack labeling formats in the UK</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12266" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12266" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-Word-300x218.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Daniel A. Ogundijo et. al. BMC Public Health</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The traffic light rating system (TLRS) and Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) are believed to provide at-a-glance nutrition information to consumers at the point of purchase and help consumers to choose food products based on their health and nutrition needs. The nutrition information displayed on the front of pack labels allowed food products to be grouped according to their levels of healthiness. The TLRS and GDA are the most common labeling formats that are used in the UK. As seen in the figure below, a combination of TLRS/GDA and TLRS/Health logos were dominant on the assessed food labels.</p>
<p><em>The levels of healthiness of foods in the UK retail market</em></p>
<p>The healthiness of foods was assessed by categorizing the food products into ‘healthier’, ’moderately healthy’ and ‘least healthy’ based on fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar contents. Red means the food is high in one of these and should be eaten less often or in smaller amounts. Amber means the food contains medium amount (neither high nor low) and may be eaten more frequently. Green indicates that the food is low in these nutrients and therefore is a healthier choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods</p></blockquote>
<p>We found out that a higher number of assessed products belonged to the “moderately healthy” and “healthier” categories than the “least healthy”. This could suggest that food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods. The imported foods that were found in the United Kingdom retail market also showed that healthier food choices could be made from the diverse food types around the world.</p>

Berlin, February 8th, 2021: Knowledge Unlatched (KU), the central platform for Open Access (OA) financing models, is pleased to announce the results of 2020 pledging round, which ended in December 2020 and once again saw hundreds of libraries worldwide pledge support for OA book and journal initiatives offered by KU and its partners.

Overall, about 310 books and 34 journals will be published OA in 2021. These include 240 books from the KU Select 2020 HSS Books Collection and 65 books from KU’s partner collections. In addition, 31 journals will be flipped to OA thanks to two ground-breaking Subscribe-to-Open (S2O) projects: Pluto Open Journals and IWAP Open Journals.
