                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened">Betelgeuse went dark, but didn’t go supernova. What happened?</a></h4>

<p>Astrophysicist Miguel Montargès has a clear memory of the moment the stars became real places to him. He was 7 or 8 years old, looking up from the garden of his parents’ apartment in the south of France. A huge, red star winked in the night. The young space fan connected the star to a map he had studied in an astronomy magazine and realized he knew its name: Betelgeuse.</p>



<p>Something shifted for him. That star was no longer an anonymous speck floating in a vast uncharted sea. It was a destination, with a name.</p>



<p>“I thought, wow, for the first time … I can name a star,” he says. The realization was life-changing.</p>



<p>Since then, Montargès, now at the Paris Observatory, has written his Ph.D. thesis and about a dozen papers about Betelgeuse. He considers the star an old friend, observing it many times a year, for work and for fun. He says good-bye every May when the star slips behind the sun from the perspective of Earth, and says hello again in August when the star comes back.</p>





<p>So in late 2019, when the bright star suddenly dimmed for no apparent reason, Montargès was a little alarmed. Some people speculated that Betelgeuse was about to explode in a brilliant supernova that would outshine the full moon. Astronomers know the star is old and its days are numbered, but Montargès wasn’t ready to see it go.</p>



<p>“It’s my favorite star,” he says. “I don’t want it to die.”</p>



<p>Other researchers, though, were eager to watch Betelgeuse explode in real time. Supernovas mark the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-death-giant-lasers-explosive-mysterious-physics">violent deaths of stars</a> that are at least eight times as massive as the sun (<em>SN: 11/7/20, p. 20</em>). But astronomers still don’t know what would signal that one is about to blow. The outbursts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready">sprinkle interstellar space with elements</a> that ultimately form the bulk of planets and people — carbon, oxygen, iron (<em>SN: 2/18/17, p. 24</em>). So the question of how supernovas occur is a question of our own origins.</p>

<h3>A bit dim</h3>



<p>The SPHERE instrument in Chile took images of Betelgeuse in January (top) and December (bottom) 2019. The December image shows a dark splotch, a dimming, over Betelgeuse’s southern hemisphere.</p>

</div>



<p>But the explosions are rare — astronomers estimate that one occurs in our galaxy just a few times a century. The last one spotted nearby, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">SN 1987A</a>, was more than 33 years ago in a neighboring galaxy (<em>SN: 2/18/17, p. 20</em>). Betelgeuse is just one of the many aging, massive stars — called red supergiants — that could go supernova at any moment. But as one of the closest and brightest, Betelgeuse is the one that space enthusiasts know best.</p>



<p>So when the star started acting strangely at the end of last year, Montargès and a small band of Betelgeuse diehards aimed every telescope they could at the dimming giant. Over the following months, the star returned to its usual brightness, and the excitement over an imminent supernova faded. But the flurry of data collected in the rush to figure out what was happening might help answer a different long-standing question: How do massive, old stars send their planet-building star stuff into the cosmos even before they explode?</p>



<h4>Orion’s shoulder</h4>



<p>If you’ve looked up at the stars during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, you’ve probably seen Betelgeuse, whether you realized it or not. The star is the second brightest in the constellation Orion, marking the hunter’s left shoulder from our perspective.</p>



<p>And it’s huge. Estimates for Betelgeuse’s vital statistics vary, but if it sat at the center of our solar system, the star would fill much of the space between the sun and Jupiter. At about 15 to 20 times as massive as the sun, somewhere between 750 and 1,000 times its diameter and just about 550 light-years from Earth, Betelgeuse is typically between the sixth- and seventh-brightest star in the sky.</p>



<p>Betelgeuse’s brightness varies, even under normal circumstances. Its outer layers are a bubbling cauldron of hot gas and plasma. As hot material rises to the surface, the star brightens; as material falls toward the core, the star dims. That convection cycle puts Betelgeuse on a semiregular dimmer switch that fluctuates roughly every 400 days or so. The star’s brightness also varies about every six years, though astronomers don’t know why.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Big deal</h3>



<p>Betelgeuse is the left shoulder of the Orion constellation (left). The star’s first portrait, made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996, took some doing. Hubble’s operators worried that the bright star would fry the telescope’s detectors. So astrophysicist Andrea Dupree had to use every filter Hubble had — “like wearing four sets of sunglasses,” she says. “There was nothing. Black. No light got through.” Only by taking off the sunglasses could she finally see the massive star, with a diameter that rivals the width of Jupiter’s orbit.</p>

</div>



<p>What they do know is that Betelgeuse is running out of time. It’s less than 10 million years old, a youngster compared with the roughly 4.6-billion–year-old sun. But because Betelgeuse is so massive and burns through its fuel so quickly, it’s already in the final life stage of a red supergiant. Someday in the not too distant future, the star won’t be able to support its own weight — it will collapse in on itself and rebound in a supernova.</p>



<p>“We know one day it’s going to die and explode,” says Emily Levesque, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. But no one knows when. “In astronomical terms, ‘one day’ means sometime in the next 200,000 years.”</p>



<p>In October 2019, Betelgeuse started dimming, which wasn’t too strange in and of itself. The change fit within the normal 400ish-day cycle, says astronomer Edward Guinan of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, who has been tracking Betelgeuse’s cycles of brightness since the 1980s.</p>



<p>But by Christmas, Betelgeuse was the dimmest it had been in the 100-plus years that astronomers have measured it. And the dimming continued all the way through February.</p>



<p>Guinan was one of the first to sound the alarm. On <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13341">December 7</a>, and again on <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13365">December 23</a>, he and colleagues posted a bulletin on The Astronomer’s Telegram website announcing the star’s “fainting” and encouraging fellow astronomers to take a look.</p>



<p>There was no reason to think that the dimming was a harbinger of a supernova. “I never said it was going to be one,” Guinan says. But because these explosions are so rare, astronomers don’t know what the signals of an imminent supernova are. Dimming could be one of them.</p>



<p>That report of odd behavior was all astronomers and amateur space enthusiasts needed to hear. Online, the story caught fire.</p>



<p>“On Twitter, it was hysterical,” says Andrea Dupree, an astrophysicist at the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian’s Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. She recalls seeing one tweet suggesting that the explosion was going to happen that night, with the hashtag #HIDE. “Where am I going to hide? Under my desk?” (When Betelgeuse finally explodes, it probably won’t hurt life on Earth — it’s a safe distance away.)</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Living large</h3>



<p>After millions of years, stars that are between eight and 30 times the sun’s mass evolve into yellow supergiants, spend a few thousand years as such, then become red supergiants like Betelgeuse. Ultimately these stars explode violently as supernovas. The images above are not to scale.<br /></p>

<p>Most astronomers didn’t really believe that Betelgeuse’s end was nigh, even as they rushed to schedule telescope time. But some got caught up in the excitement.</p>



<p>“I don’t expect it to blow,” Guinan recalls thinking. “But I don’t want to blink.” He signed up for phone alerts from telescopes that detect invisible particles called neutrinos and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. A detection of either one might be an early sign of a supernova. He found himself outside at 1 a.m. in January after a report of gravitational waves from the direction of Orion. “It was cloudy, but I thought I might see a brightening,” he says. “I’ve gotten crazy about it.”</p>



<p>Others were believers too, until their data cast doubt on the notion.</p>



<p>“I thought it might,” says astrophysicist Thavisha Dharmawardena of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “We knew there were other explanations, and we might have to look into it. But we know Betelgeuse is an old star, close to the end of its life. It was exciting.”</p>



<h4>Two camps</h4>



<p>Once the star started <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13512">returning to its usual brightness</a> in mid-February, talk of an imminent supernova faded. A paper published in the Oct. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal </em>boosted confidence in Betelgeuse’s longevity, suggesting that the star is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb8db">just at the beginning of its old age</a> and has at least 100,000 years to go before it explodes. But what was it up to, if it was not on the verge of exploding?</p>



<p>As results from telescopes all over the world and in space flooded in, most astronomers have fallen into two camps. One says Betelgeuse’s dimming was caused by a cloud of dust coughed out by the star itself, blocking its glow. The other camp isn’t sure what the explanation is, but says “no” to the dust speculation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="an illustration showing Betelgeuse sneezing out a burst of gas and dust" class="wp-image-3093884" height="474" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_lg_betelgeuse_inline4_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093884">One explanation for why Betelgeuse went dark in 2019 is that the star sneezed out a burst of gas and dust (illustrated, left), which condensed into a dark cloud. That cloud blocked the star’s face from the perspective of Earth (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093884">NASA, ESA, E. Wheatley/STScI</span></figure>



<p>If the dust theory proves true, it could have profound implications for the origins of complex chemistry, planets and even life in the universe. Red supergiants are surrounded by diffuse clouds of gas and dust that are full of elements that are forged only in stars — and those clouds form before the star explodes. Even before they die, supergiants seem to bequeath material to the next generation of stars.</p>



<p>“The carbon, oxygen in our body, it’s coming from there — from the supernova and from the clouds around dying stars,” Montargès says. But it’s not clear how those elements escape the stars in the first place. “We have no idea,” he says.</p>



<p>Montargès hoped studying Betelgeuse’s dimming would let scientists see that process in action.</p>



<p>In December 2019, he and colleagues took an image of Betelgeuse in visible light with the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. That image showed that, yes, <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2003/">Betelgeuse was much dimmer</a> than it had been 11 months earlier — but only the star’s bottom half. Perhaps an asymmetrical dust cloud was to blame.</p>



<p>Observations from February 15, 2020, seem to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dust-supernova-explosion">support that idea</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/20, p. 6</em>). Levesque and Philip Massey of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., compared the February observations with similar ones from 2004. The star’s temperature hadn’t dropped as much as would be expected if the dimming was from something intrinsic to the star, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab7935">like its convection cycles</a>, the pair reported in the March 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>That left dust as a reasonable explanation. “We know Betelgeuse sheds mass and produces dust around itself,” Levesque says. “Dust could have come toward us, cooled and temporarily blocked the light.”</p>



<h4>Dark cloud</h4>



<p>A strong vote for dust came from Dupree, who was watching Betelgeuse with the Hubble Space Telescope. Like Guinan, she has a decades-long relationship with Betelgeuse. In 1996, she and colleague Ronald Gilliland looked at Betelgeuse with Hubble to make the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1996/04/394-Image.html">first real image of any star other than the sun</a>. Most stars are too far and too faint to show up as anything but a point. Betelgeuse is one of the few stars whose surface can be seen as a two-dimensional disk — a real place.</p>



<p>By the end of 2019, Dupree was observing Betelgeuse with Hubble several times a year. She had assembled an international team of researchers she calls the MOB, for Months of Betelgeuse, to observe the star frequently in a variety of wavelengths of light.</p>

<p>The goal was the same as Montargès’: to answer fundamental questions about how Betelgeuse, and perhaps other red supergiants, lose material. The MOB had baseline observations from before the dimming and already had Hubble time scheduled to track the star’s brightness cycles.</p>



<p>Those observations showed that in January and March 2019, Betelgeuse looked “perfectly normal,” Dupree says. But from September through November, just before the dimming event, the star gave out more ultraviolet light — up to four or five times its usual UV brightness — over its southern hemisphere.</p>



<p>The temperature and electron density in that region went up, too. And material seemed to be moving outward, away from the star and toward Earth.</p>



<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba516">Dupree and colleagues’ theory</a> of what happened, reported in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>, is that one of the giant bubbles of hot plasma always churning in the star’s outer layers rose to the edge of the star’s atmosphere and escaped, sending huge amounts of material flowing into interstellar space. That could be one way that red supergiants shed material before exploding.</p>



<p>Once it had fled the star, that hot stuff cooled, condensed into dust and floated in front of Betelgeuse for several months. As the dust cleared, Betelgeuse appeared brighter again.</p>



<p>“It seems to us that what we saw with the ultraviolet is kind of the smoking gun,” Dupree says. “This material moved on out, condensed and formed this dark, dark dust cloud.”</p>



<p>Paul Hertz, director of NASA’s astrophysics division, shared the Hubble results in a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/virtual-townhall-2020">NASA online town hall</a> meeting on September 10 as if it were the final answer. “Mystery solved,” he said. “Not gonna supernova anytime soon.”</p>



<h4>Cycles and spots</h4>



<p>Maybe not — but that doesn’t mean dust explains the dimming.</p>



<p>In the July 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, Dharmawardena and colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9ca6">published observations</a> of Betelgeuse that ran counter to the dust explanation. Her team used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii in January, February and March to look at Betelgeuse in submillimeter wavelengths of light. “If we think it’s a dust cloud, the submillimeter is the perfect wavelength to look at,” she says.</p>



<p>Dust should have made Betelgeuse look brighter in those wavelengths, as floating grains absorbed and reemitted starlight. But it didn’t. If anything, the star dimmed slightly. “Our first thought was that we’d done something wrong — everyone in the community expected it to be dust,” she says. But “the fact that it didn’t increase or stay constant in the submillimeter was pretty much a dead giveaway that it’s not dust.”</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13884.pdf">Infrared observations with the airborne SOFIA telescope</a> should have found the glowing signature of dust too, if it existed. “It never showed up,” Guinan says. “I don’t think it’s dust.”</p>



<p>Instead, Guinan thinks the dimming may have been part of Betelgeuse’s natural convection cycle. The star’s outer atmosphere constantly pulsates and “breathes” in and out as enormous bubbles of hot plasma rise to the surface and sink down again. “It’s driven by the internal core of the star,” he says. “You have hot blobs rising up, they cool, they get more dense, they fall back.”</p>



<p>Multiple cycles syncing up could explain why the 2019 dimming was so extreme. Guinan and colleagues analyzed about 180 years of observations of Betelgeuse, dating back to astronomer John Herschel’s 1839 discovery that the star’s brightness varies. Guinan’s group found that, in addition to the roughly six-year and 400-day cycles, Betelgeuse might have a third, smaller cycle of about 187 days. It looks like all three cycles might have hit their brightness nadirs at the same time in late 2019, Guinan says.</p>



<p>Or maybe the darkness in the southern hemisphere that Montargès’ team saw with SPHERE was an enormous star spot, Dharmawardena offers. In the sun’s case, those dark splotches, called sunspots, mark the sites of magnetic activity on the surface. Betelgeuse is one of a handful of stars on which star spots have been directly seen.</p>



<p>But to cause Betelgeuse’s dimming, a star spot would have to be enormous. Typical star spots cover about 20 to 30 percent of a star’s surface, Dharmawardena says. This one would need to cover at least half, maybe up to 70 percent.</p>



<p>“That’s rare,” Dharmawardena admits. “But so is this kind of dimming.”</p>



<h4>Pandemic disruptions</h4>



<p>Analyses are still coming in. But just as Betelgeuse was returning to its normal brightness, the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>



<p>“We were hoping to have a lot more data,” Dharmawardena says.</p>



<p>A few observations came in right under the wire. The SOFIA observations were made on one of the last flights before the pandemic grounded the plane that carries the telescope. And Montargès took another look with SPHERE just days before its observatory shut down in mid-March.</p>

</div>



<p>But one of Montargès’ most hoped-for results may never come. Eager to solve the dust versus not-dust mystery, his plan was to combine two kinds of observations: making a 2-D picture of the whole star’s disk, like Dupree did with Hubble in the ’90s, but in longer wavelengths such as infrared or submillimeter, like Dharmawardena’s images from early 2020. That way, you could differentiate the dust from the star, he reasoned.</p>



<p>Only one observatory can do both at once: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in Chile. Montargès had planned to ask to observe Betelgeuse with ALMA in June and July, when the winter skies in the Southern Hemisphere are most free of turbulence. But ALMA closed in March and was still closed in September.</p>



<p>“When I realized ALMA will not get the time in June, I thought … we are never going to solve it,” he says. “We may never be completely certain, because of COVID.”</p>



<h4>Any other star</h4>



<p>Montargès and his colleagues have submitted their analysis of the SPHERE pictures from March for publication. Though he’s not yet willing to share the results, he thinks they could pull the two camps together.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if Betelgeuse did cough out a cloud of dust last year, it could teach us about the origins of life in the universe, Montargès says. If the dust camp is even partially right, Betelgeuse’s dimming may have been the first time humans have watched the seeds of life being launched into the cosmos.</p>



<p>In the meantime, he’s relieved to see his favorite star shining bright again. “I must admit that since [last] December, since this whole stuff started, every time I see it, I am like, phew, it’s still there,” he says.</p>



<p>People keep asking him if he would like ​Betelgeuse to go supernova so he can study it. “I would like another star to go supernova,” he says. “Antares, I don’t care about it; it can explode anytime. But not Betelgeuse.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a></h4>

<p><em>Chapter 7 of </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/family-guide-to-mental-illness-and-the-law-9780190622220?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Family Guide to Mental Illness and the Law</a></em><em> is titled “When Police Are Called to Help” and deals with two types of circumstances: those involving people with mental illness as victims of crime and those in which families seek help from police during a mental health crisis. This blog post contains one small excerpt from that chapter.</em><em> </em></p><p>When you call 911 for assistance with someone whose mental health symptoms are out of control:</p><h2>1. Ask for the Crisis Intervention Team</h2><p>Specifically ask for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers with mental health training. Tell the dispatcher that the person you are calling about has a diagnosed mental illness and is experiencing a mental health crisis and explain what that illness is.</p><h2>2. Help prepare the police officers for the scene</h2><p>Then after setting that foundation help prepare the officers for the scene by giving the 911 operator all of the details about the current behavior.</p><ul><li>Does this person have a weapon?</li><li>Is the person athletic or trained in martial arts?</li><li>Give facts about their size.</li><li> At this moment, is the person delusional, depressed, hallucinating, manic, spastic, or agitated?</li><li>Provide very quick context for any statements that the person is making.</li></ul><h2>3. Flag down the police officers upon arrival</h2><p>To help make the police encounter as safe as possible for everyone present, you or someone else should go outside to flag down the police and tell them where the building entrances are and where the event is happening inside the building.</p><h2>4. Give the on-scene police officers an update</h2><p>Even though you told everything to the dispatcher, give a quick descriptive update to the on-scene police as soon as you can. For example:</p><ul><li>“My bipolar thirty-year-old son, Steve, threw me down the stairs. I don’t know if he took his medicine. He is shaking all over and won’t talk to any of us.”</li><li>“My twenty-five-year-old sister, Kay, is delusional. She is pulling everything off of the shelves and throwing it on the floor. I ran next door. Nobody else is in the house with her.”</li><li>“My husband, Ted, is depressed. He locked himself in the upstairs bathroom and is crying about an old business failure. He keeps saying angry things about Bob, but Bob is long gone. There is no reason to worry about Bob.”</li></ul><h2>5. Stay out of the way</h2><p>Once the officers begin to work the scene, stay out of the way! Do not talk unless an officer asks you a question or calls on you to say something but stay close enough that the officers can communicate with you if they need to. The CIT officers know how to interact with people suffering from specific mental disturbances; they do not need you to translate for them. All police officers are trained to stabilize situations, so even if there is not a CIT officer present you should not interfere once you’ve oriented the officers to the situation.</p><p> </p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/ZXqE31D8TEk">Davey Heuser</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/how-to-call-for-the-police-crisis-intervention-team/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/639355027/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-jeremiah-barker-papers-medicine-as-practiced-200-years-ago/" rel="nofollow">The Jeremiah Barker Papers: medicine as practiced 200 years ago</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-case-for-investing-in-wind-energy/" rel="nofollow">The case for investing in wind energy</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>While puberty is not the easiest time of most people’s lives, the onset of early puberty is a notable public health issue which can lead to a higher risk of developing mental, emotional, and physical health conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, substance use, risky sexual activities, early sexual debut, and underage pregnancy.</p>
<p>A study by Aghaee <em>et al.</em> explored the impact of household intactness (defined as the child living with both parents until at least the age of 6, with this being checked during approximately a dozen healthcare visits between the ages of 0 and 6) on pubertal trajectories, focusing on filling the knowledge gap with regards to racial/ethnic minorities, as the majority of previous studies have been conducted using predominantly White cohorts. Their study included 26,044 girls born at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical facility between 2003 and 2010.</p>
<p>This study found that early life exposure to household non-intactness was associated with early pubertal timing in the girls included in this study, and that this association may vary between race/ethnicity, strongest among Black girls. While it goes without saying that the conditions of the family home cannot be modified by healthcare professionals, this knowledge can help facilitate conversations with the caregivers of young girls, who can work with providers to pinpoint areas of home life that can be improved through social and family services, hopefully avoiding the risk of early puberty.</p>

<p>In the US, immigrants who lack citizenship face significant barriers to accessing health care. From undocumented immigrants who are less likely to have medical insurance, to those with temporary status who are ineligible for federally-funded public insurance, and even lawful permanent residents (such as green card holders), immigrants face barriers compared to individuals with citizenship.</p>
<p>In recent years, state policy makers have increasingly enacted restrictive immigrant policies, referred to as criminalization policies based on their punitive treatment of noncitizens though surveillance and policing, linking immigration to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>A study by Young <em>et al.</em> noted that these criminalization policies reinforced the marginalization of non-citizens, also producing health inequity between the states in the US. Advancing policies that de-criminalize or buffer immigrants from federal enforcement is critical to promote immigrants’ access to care and well-being.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of clinical research is the informed consent of participants, a process which is rendered even more complex when a trial involves patients nearing the end of life where the research promises them little clinical benefit.</p>
<p>A study by Murphy <em>et al.</em> aimed at gaining greater understanding of how these patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation. They interviewed non-curative cancer patients in the UK who had previously been invited to participate in a clinical trial, as well as some of the healthcare professionals involved in their care, oncologists and clinical research nurses.</p>
<p>Both the patients and healthcare professionals indicated that “nothing to lose” was a core aspect of the decision making process, from the part of a patient as a search for a life-line, and for the healthcare professionals as a way to maintain hope for the patients. Generally, the patients and healthcare professionals were found to have similar perspectives. Informed consent is critical to ensure patients are fully informed of the trial requirements and potential outcomes, a task which is both more difficult and more important considering the vulnerability of this particular population.</p>

<p>The transcriptome remains a vastly under explored space despite its significance as a foundation for biology. The current challenges in annotating eukaryotic transcriptomes are biological complexity, RNA preparation, limitations of sequencing technologies and sequence analysis. Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can provide additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to differentiate from sequencing noise.</p>
<p>Kuo <em>et al.</em> have developed the Transcriptome Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software, aiming to leverage the power of long read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current processing pipelines. TAMA uses long read transcript data and high-quality reference genome assemblies to produce accurate and informative transcript models, improving transcript model prediction accuracy and increase transcriptome discovery with transparent and traceable steps.</p>
<p>TAMA, along with other commonly used tools, were used to analyse publicly available sequencing data (the Universal Human Reference RNA UHRR Sequel II Iso-Seq data), noted to have high read depth and long read accuracy. The use of parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. The authors found long read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read RNA sequencing data.</p>

<p>In the UK, the number of overweight and obese men is higher than the number of women, however, men are less likely to participate in weight management programmes. In fact, little is known as to how to best recruit men to weight management programmes.</p>
<p>McDonald <em>et. al</em> sought input from both patients and the public in their pre-trial decisions in order to try and successfully recruit male participants for a men-only weight management intervention. Various aspects of the recruitment process were discussed, from recruitment materials, to the study’s catchy name: “Game of Stones”, chosen by popular vote.</p>
<p>The authors of this study concluded that no single strategy appealed to all men, but their mixed methods approach highlighted factors which contributed to successful recruitment, among them the importance of language and adopting a sensitive approach to recruit the men. Recruitment strategy decisions should be evidence based and involve input from target group members, and further work is required to examine how these strategies could be implemented and sustained in practice.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We tend to think of empathy as a wholly positive thing, a trait that’s not only favourable to possess but that we should actively foster. Books and courses promise to reveal secret wells of empathy and ways to channel them; some people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/24/superpower-empaths-paid-read-mind-empathy">even charge</a> for “empathy readings”, a service that seems to sit somewhere between a psychic reading and a therapy session.</p>



<p>It would be easy to assume, therefore, that people who express empathy are generally well-liked. But a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69773-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology </em>finds that our feelings towards “empathisers” depends on <em>who</em> they are empathising with. While empathisers were considered warmer overall, participants judged people who expressed empathy for those with troubling political views more harshly — suggesting that we don’t always interpret empathy as a pure moral virtue.</p>



<span id="more-40920"></span>



<p>In the first study, 464 participants were shown a scenario in which Ann (the “target”) and Beth (the “responder”) were meeting for the first time. In one condition, Ann worked for a children’s hospital; in the other, she worked for a white supremacist group.</p>



<p>Participants then read a conversation between the pair, with Ann telling Beth about a stressful experience at work planning an event for a large group of people. Those in the “empathic response” condition heard that Beth empathised with Ann, while other participants read that Beth gave a non-committal response. Finally, participants indicated how much they liked, respected, trusted and would like to be friends with Beth as well as how caring, kind and understanding they felt she was.</p>



<p>As expected, participants respected and liked Beth more, and considered her more warm, when she answered empathetically in the scenario where Ann worked at a hospital. When Ann worked for a white supremacist group, however, participants did not like Beth more or less depending on her response — though they did perceive her as slightly warmer when she was empathetic. These results were replicated in a second study in which Ann was presented as pro- or anti-vaccination. And in a third, participants liked Beth <em>less</em> when she empathised with a positive experience recounted by white supremacist Ann.      </p>



<p>In the next study, participants saw the same information from the first studies, including the same empathetic response from Beth. But this time, the non-empathetic response was actively condemning: participants heard that Beth told Ann that it “sounds to me like you’re getting what you deserve”. And participants liked and respected Beth more when she gave this negative response to white supremacist Ann (though she was still considered warmer when responding empathetically). This was also the case in a follow-up study replacing Ann and Beth with male figures, suggesting that the effect is not gendered.</p>



<p>“Empathy towards white supremacists isn’t favourably looked upon” isn’t hugely shocking news. But the study does shed some light on the way we think about empathy in general. As noted, empathy is often depicted as an uncomplicated moral good — something we should unconditionally strive for. But the results suggest a more complex situation, where empathy is morally relative rather than absolute. This is also evident in assessments of warmth, another seemingly straightforward trait — even when participants didn’t like or respect Beth, they still considered her warm.</p>



<p>Further research could look at how this impacts behaviour — that is, are we less likely to be friends with or act positively towards someone who has empathised with a group or person we dislike? And how does this affect processes like voting or endorsing particular political candidates?</p>



<p>Though we tend to think of empathy as something that exists between two people or groups, we rarely think about the third party observers witnessing it. But as the study shows, understanding the broader social context of empathy may help us better understand its true effects.</p>

<p>We were warned this might happen.</p>



<p>While millions stayed home last spring, looking to summer for respite from the virus, experts worried that an even larger fall surge was around the corner.</p>



<p>We’ve rounded that corner. As cases and hospitalizations reach record levels across Europe and the United States, leaders are being forced to make hard decisions about what to shut down and when. In the United States, President-elect Joe Biden has made clear that he won’t call for a national lockdown, but more targeted shutdowns at the state or local level are on the table. And in fact, many regions are already rolling out more targeted approaches, focusing on crowded spaces like restaurants, bars, or schools.</p>



<p>European countries began rolling out new restrictions in October, and in the United States many governors and city officials are beginning to partially clamp down. <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-update">Public schools in New York City were closed</a> on November 19; Minnesota has <a href="https://mn.gov/covid19/">shuttered bars and restaurants</a> for a month starting November 20; California officials enacted <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/11/19/state-issues-limited-stay-at-home-order-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19/">curfews</a> between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in certain counties through December 21. </p>

<p>Whether these fine-tuned restrictions will work remains to be seen. But scientists have been studying what worked and what didn’t in the early months of the pandemic, revealing some promising approaches. New research suggests that focusing on closing or reducing capacity at transmission hot spots while keeping less risky parts of the economy open can curb exponential rises in cases, while minimizing harm to the economy. </p>



<p>“We don’t need to fully shelter in place to slow transmission,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a mathematical biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But these sharper approaches work only if governments set clear guidelines and people follow them, she says. Even the smartest interventions will be overwhelmed if enacted too late amidst rampant transmission within a community.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at what may work, and what doesn’t.</p>



<h4>Don’ts: What didn’t work</h4>



<p>In hindsight, some of the measures enacted in the earliest days of the pandemic did little to quell it. Temperature checks and deep cleaning of public surfaces emerged as two largely ineffective measures in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0">a global analysis</a> published November 16 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>



<p>Early on, “no one had a clue as to how to stop the spread of the virus,” says Peter Klimek, a data scientist at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria. Instead, countries threw the kitchen sink at the virus, enacting many measures simultaneously.</p>



<p>Klimek and his colleagues used statistical techniques to try to disentangle which measures worked and which didn’t. In 56 different countries, including the United States, they assessed how more than 6,000 different interventions affected infection rates in the weeks after enactment. What they found comports with what we’ve since learned about the virus and how it spreads.</p>



<p>Temperature checks, at border crossing or airports, aren’t especially effective because people are often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear">contagious well before symptom onset</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/20</em>). Deep cleaning public places such as subway cars seemed prudent early on, but evidence suggests that touching shared surfaces isn’t a big driver of transmission events, Klimek says. Instead, the coronavirus spreads <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">most easily through the air</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>)</p>



<h4>Do: Target transmission hot spots</h4>



<p>Given the ease of airborne spread, interventions that targeted transmission hot spots — crowded indoor spaces — worked best, especially cancelling small gatherings of up to 50 people. “Basically this includes the closure of bars, restaurants, cafes, having people work from home if possible, and bans on family celebrations like weddings, funerals,” Klimek says.</p>



<p>Limits on large gatherings, stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions proved effective too, along with increasing access to personal protective equipment and educating the public about risk management. </p>



<p>These measures were more effective when enacted sooner, the researchers found. For instance, responding to a rise in cases quickly by cancelling small gatherings and restricting some travel, but keeping schools open, slowed the spread as much as if all three measures were enacted two weeks later when cases were much higher, Klimek says.</p>



<p>“Countries that are facing difficult situations right now likely waited too long,” Klimek says. “It’s better to act sooner and act more decisively.”</p>



<p>Part of the hesitancy to act early stems from a fear of the economic consequences of shutdowns. But scientists are trying to chart paths that minimize those economic costs while still controlling the virus.  </p>

<h3>Flattening the curve   </h3>



<p>The changing weekly average of daily new confirmed cases in select countries since March shows that restrictions that some European countries enacted in October and November were followed by a decline in new cases, while cases continue to spike in the United States.

<p>“If we can identify economic sectors that contribute most to transmission and least to gross domestic product, then those our prime candidates to close down,” says Katharina Hauck, a health economist at Imperial College London. “You get the biggest impact on transmission and the least damage to GDP.”</p>



<p>To identify those sectors, Hauck and her colleagues simulated the effects of more targeted restrictions on disease spread and the economy in the United Kingdom, drawing on both economics and epidemiology. Using detailed survey data on people’s levels of contact, and thus transmission, at different sorts of businesses and residences, the researchers projected the effects of restricting different sectors. </p>



<p>A widespread shutdown that maintains only essential services across 63 economic sectors, but leaves schools and universities open, would <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-11-16-COVID19-Report-35.pdf">keep COVID-19 hospitalizations within capacity</a>, according to the report released November 16. Such a blunt shutdown would cost the United Kingdom 229 billion pounds (about $306 billion U.S. dollars) in lost GDP over the next six months, compared with hypothetically leaving the economy open but allowing hospitals to be overwhelmed.</p>



<p>A fully open scenario would send 68,000 people to the hospital at the height of the surge, compared with the United Kingdom’s peak of around 18,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in April, the researchers say. But letting the virus burn through a population unabated could have unforeseen and drastic economic consequences, in addition to leading to many more deaths.</p>



<p>Alternatively, more targeted restrictions focused on high contact sectors like restaurants, retail shops, and entertainment venues could keep hospitals functional while allowing schools and universities to remain mostly open, along with manufacturing centers, construction, financial services and agriculture. Such a scenario cost the United Kingdom only 26 billion pounds (about $35 billion) in lost GDP, compared with keeping everything open.</p>

<p>“Our study shows how we might fine-tune closures of the economy and save both lives and livelihoods,” Hauck says. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november">England</a> and much of Europe are in the midst of a more fine-tuned approach this fall, with restaurants and cafes closed in many countries but schools remaining largely open. There are preliminary signs these measures are turning the tide. Daily case counts in France, for instance, have fallen nearly 70 percent, from a weekly rolling average of over 54,868 on November 8 to 16,722 on November 25.</p>



<h4>Do: Reduce crowding</h4>



<p>Could similarly targeted restrictions work in the United States? </p>



<p>Simply <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2923-3">limiting capacity at key transmission hot spots</a>, such as restaurants, may be enough to curtail exponential spread in some cities, according to an analysis published November 10 in <em>Nature</em>. “Closing the economy does not have to be all or nothing, doesn’t have to be total lockdown and full reopening,” says Jure Leskovec, a computer scientist at Stanford University.</p>



<p>Leskovec and his colleagues turned to cell phone mobility data from some 98 million Americans across 10 large metro areas, including Chicago, New York City, Atlanta and Washington D.C. This database allowed the researchers to “visualize” these people as particles, whose location is updated each hour as they move from their homes to places like restaurants, grocery stores and gyms. The researchers excluded schools and workplaces from their analysis.</p>



<p>From this starting point, they built a statistical model, tweaking variables that control how easily a virus can jump from particle to particle (in effect, person to person) in different situations until the model closely matched the actual case counts in these 10 cities from March to May, even as these cities enacted social distancing measures. </p>



<p>“From an epidemiological standpoint the model is quite simple, but it shows the power of mobility in spreading the virus,” Leskovec says. That simplicity also allowed the researchers to simulate different reopening strategies, seeing how restricting mobility at different locations influenced the spread of disease. </p>



<p>Overall, most predicted infections occurred at a small number of places. In Chicago, for instance, their analyses found that 85 percent of infections occurred at just 10 percent of places outside the home, including restaurants and fitness centers. But 80 percent of those infections could be prevented by capping the maximum occupancy at any given time to 20 percent of normal. Leskovec says that these businesses still retain 60 percent of overall visitors, by their estimation, but the visits were more spread out so fewer people clustered together at any given time. “For the price of 40 percent of visitors, we’re preventing 80 percent of infections,” he says.</p>



<p>Limiting occupancy is especially important in lower-income neighborhoods, the researchers found. Residents of these neighborhoods <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-control-increasing-cases">socially distance less due to work-related demands</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>), and Leskovec’s analysis predicted higher infection rates at particular spots. “A single trip to the grocery store is twice as dangerous for a low-income person than a high-income person” in eight of the 10 metro areas, Leskovec says. “Low-income families go to stores that are more densely packed than richer families, and they stay longer,” Leskovec says.</p>



<p>Limiting capacity at these often crowded locations, or creating other ways of distributing food in these neighborhoods, might start to ameliorate COVID-19’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">stark racial and ethnic health disparities</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). </p>

<h4>Do: Act early</h4>



<p>While targeted shutdowns can work, these more precise tools are only effective if enacted before community spread takes off. “You have to tap on the brakes at the first indication that things are taking an alarming turn,” says Meyers, the mathematical biologist. “If intensive care units start reaching capacity, then it’s time to slam on the brakes,” with longer, more restrictive measures.</p>



<p>In the United States, many regions may have already passed the optimal moment to start tapping the brakes with less restrictive measures, Meyers says. “The key pressure points for reducing transmission, like restrictions on indoor dining, are also some of the hardest things to get enacted.” But for every day that social distancing measures are delayed, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-1932_article">cities need on average two and a half more days of restrictions to contain an outbreak</a>, Meyers and colleagues report in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> in September. </p>



<p>“Waiting a week to act not only means that things probably look worse in terms of hospitalizations, but it also might mean that we have to lock down for two and a half extra weeks longer,” Meyers says. “So even though we’re trying to avoid that sort of economic cost up front, it may come back to bite us.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Criminals are often characterised in the popular press as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nb7eAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">“animals” or “cold-blooded”</a>. Such adjectives effectively dehumanise them, and there’s no end of research finding that if we deny fully human emotional and thinking capacities to other people, we are less likely to treat them in a humane way. But how long does prisoner dehumanisation last? Is it a life sentence? Or, wondered the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220911496">new paper</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, does it depend on how long a prisoner has left to serve?</p>



<span id="more-40913"></span>



<p>Jason C. Deska at Ryerson University in Canada and his colleagues ran a series of seven studies to investigate this. In each, participants viewed a series of 20 mugshots of White men imprisoned in Florida. Though the mugshots were of real prisoners, the team manipulated the accompanying information, so that each man’s sentence was stated as being around 1,460 days (four years), and they had either served around one month or had only about one month left in prison.</p>



<p>The first two studies, on 148 students and then 155 adults recruited online, revealed that the participants ascribed greater mental sophistication to the prisoners who were about to be released than to those who had only just started their sentences. These prisoners were credited with having greater emotional and cognitive faculties as well as greater agency — an ability to act according to their own individual intentions. They were, in other words, subject to less dehumanisation.</p>



<p>In the next five studies, the researchers further explored what they called the “time-to-serve effect”. They investigated the potential role of the participants’ beliefs about the four primary functions of incarceration, as identified by laypeople as well as experts in criminal justice. These are: rehabilitation, retribution, deterrence (from committing another crime) and incapacitation (removing criminals from society, to prevent them from harming anyone else). In each study, fresh batches of online participants viewed the same 20 mugshots, along with sentencing information. But as well as completing the Mind Attribution Scale, which measured any dehumanisation, participants also rated the extent to which they felt that the prisoner had either been rehabilitated, punished, deterred or incapacitated. (Each study included just one of these mini-scales.)</p>



<p>Soon-to-be-released prisoners were seen as being more rehabilitated, more adequately punished, and more likely to have been deterred from committing future crimes. These perceptions in turn led people to view the prisoners approaching the end of their sentence as more “human”. The researchers stress that they are not arguing that prison is an effective deterrent, or that punishment causes prisoners to gain mental sophistication — rather, that beliefs about how well the functions of prison have been met seem to affect levels of dehumanisation of prisoners.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants completed all three of these scales, rather than just one. This time, only beliefs relating to levels of rehabilitation and deterrence — and not retribution — emerged as being important for driving the “time to serve” effect.</p>



<p>As the team notes, deterrence and retribution both involve the infliction of pain on the individual, but only deterrence seeks to <em>change</em> that person. Effective rehabilitation and deterrence both entail changes in the prisoner’s mental state, and, it seems, either less dehumanisation by others, or a restoration of ascriptions of typical human capacities.</p>



<p>“Prisoners are a chronically dehumanized social group,” the team notes. Given work finding that dehumanisation of prisoners “both impedes successful rehabilitation and facilitates inhumane treatment”, it’s clearly important to understand the circumstances and beliefs that can affect these kinds of views.</p>



<p>“Although our data cannot speak to how effective incarceration is for actual rehabilitation and deterrence, they do suggest that emphasising these functions of incarceration may be especially important for interventions designed at integrating ex-convicts back into society,” the team concludes. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/29/researchers-assume-white-americans-are-more-representative-of-humankind-than-other-groups-according-to-analysis-of-psychology-paper-titles/">Well, they do if that society comprises mostly White Americans</a>, and if the prisoners are all White males, as was the case here. As the researchers themselves note, “Future work would do well to examine how diverse participants in non-WEIRD cultures dehumanize prisoners across the course of their prison term.” Different cultural attitudes, and also the nature of a prisoner’s crime (in these studies, the crimes were deliberately not identified) could clearly affect prisoner dehumanisation, too. But these are interesting first steps to a deeper understanding of which beliefs lead us to dehumanise prisoners, and how they might be modified.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about a paper "Complex Dynamics in Simplified Neuronal Models: Reproducing Golgi Cell Electroresponsiveness".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brain neurons exhibit complex electroresponsive properties – including intrinsic
subthreshold oscillations and pacemaking, resonance and phase-reset – which are
thought to play a critical role in controlling neural network dynamics. Although
these properties emerge from detailed representations of molecular-level
mechanisms in “realistic” models, they cannot usually be generated by simplified
neuronal models (although these may show spike-frequency adaptation and
bursting). We report here that this whole set of properties can be generated by
the extended generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (E-GLIF) neuron model. E-GLIF
derives from the GLIF model family and is therefore mono-compartmental, keeps
the limited computational load typical of a linear low-dimensional system,
admits analytical solutions and can be tuned through gradient-descent
algorithms. Importantly, E-GLIF is designed to maintain a correspondence between
model parameters and neuronal membrane mechanisms through a minimum set of
equations. In order to test its potential, E-GLIF was used to model a specific
neuron showing rich and complex electroresponsiveness, the cerebellar Golgi
cell, and was validated against experimental electrophysiological data recorded
from Golgi cells in acute cerebellar slices. During simulations, E-GLIF was
activated by stimulus patterns, including current steps and synaptic inputs,
identical to those used for the experiments. The results demonstrate that E-GLIF
can reproduce the whole set of complex neuronal dynamics typical of these
neurons – including intensity-frequency curves, spike-frequency adaptation,
post-inhibitory rebound bursting, spontaneous subthreshold oscillations,
resonance, and phase-reset – providing a new effective tool to investigate brain
dynamics in large-scale simulations.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-drug-treat-rapid-aging-disease-progeria">The FDA has approved the first drug to treat the rapid-aging disease progeria</a></h4>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a treatment that could give children with a rare genetic illness that causes premature aging more time to live.</p>



<p>Children with the disease, known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, or progeria for short, often die of heart failure, heart attack or stroke as teenagers. Most children with the disorder die before they reach age 15. The newly approved drug, called Zokinvy, is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome-and-some-progeroid-laminopathies">the first and only approved treatment for progeria</a> and certain related syndromes, the FDA announced November 20.</p>



<p>In clinical trials of 62 children receiving the drug, Zokinvy increased life span by about 3 months on average during the first three years of treatment, compared with another 81 kids who did not take the drug from a separate study that collected their health data. Following children who continued to receive Zokinvy for up to 11 years showed that, on average, kids’ life spans were lengthened by about 2.5 years.</p>



<p>“This is not a cure,” cautions Monica Kleinman, a pediatric critical care doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital who was involved with the clinical trials. “We’ve hopefully extended the life span that [the children] have by slowing the pace of the disease,” but, she says, the drug doesn’t give kids a normal length of life.</p>





<p>An estimated 350 to 400 kids across the world have progeria. For these children, a single mutation in their genetic code <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-disease-sets-moms-research-agenda">upends their health</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/13</em>). That mutation interferes with the gene responsible for making the protein lamin A, which helps hold cells’ nuclei together. Children with progeria end up with higher amounts of a defective protein called progerin, which is similar to lamin A but with an extra piece attached. This protein gets stuck in cells’ membranes and can’t be recycled for fresh proteins, causing the cells to prematurely age and making blood vessels and connective tissue stiffer, Kleinman says.   </p>



<p>Everyone makes some progerin, and the body makes more as it gets older, Kleinman explains, but “children with progeria make a huge amount.” Children typically appear normal at birth, but start to show signs of the illness in their first two years of life. Over their lives, these kids experience loss of hair and body fat, joint stiffness, cardiovascular disease and other symptoms of accelerated aging.</p>



<p>Zokinvy, made by the company Eiger BioPharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, Calif., blocks some of that progerin production, lowering the amount that accumulates in kids’ cells. But the oral drug, taken as capsules, doesn’t fully block production, she says, and the amount that patients can receive is limited by the drug’s side effects, which include vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue.</p>



<p>The drug is a “testament to the power of basic research,” says Tom Misteli, a cell biologist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md, who was not involved with work on the drug. Zokinvy builds on decades of research on many aspects of the lamin A protein, including the “seemingly esoteric chemical modification” that forms progerin, he says.</p>



<p>“Nobody studying this protein or the modification could have expected it to become a drug target,” Misteli adds. But once the disease-causing gene was identified, researchers zeroed in on the class of drugs that includes Zokinvy as potential treatments.</p>



<p>With the new drug approval, the focus is now to test additional drugs or therapeutics in combination with Zokinvy, Misteli says. That could help lengthen the lives of children with progeria even further. Researchers are also investigating gene therapy approaches, with the goal of fixing the mutation that causes the debilitating illness. </p>

The OAPEN Foundation is delighted to announce that Niels Stern has been appointed as Director of OAPEN Foundation. Niels will take over from Eelco Ferwerda on the 1st of January, as Eelco will retire at the end of this year. Niels will also join Pierre Mounier as a member of the Executive Board of DOAB Foundation. And at the same time, Ronald Snijder will be appointed as Deputy Director of OAPEN.

 

The appointment comes at an exciting time for OAPEN, ten years after the launch of OAPEN Foundation and a few months after the launch of our newest resource, the OAPEN OA Books Toolkit. At the same time, we are migrating DOAB to an open source platform as part of the ongoing OPERAS-P project. And last but not least, OAPEN and DOAB were jointly deemed essential open science services by SCOSS, the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services, and are seeking support from the open science community in the current SCOSS funding cycle.

On behalf of the Board of the OAPEN Foundation, chairman Bas Savenije said: “In the past 10 years Eelco Ferwerda has successfully transformed OAPEN from a project to an organisation which is recognised internationally as an important player in open access book publishing. Important steps towards a sustainable organisation have been made and we are confident that Niels Stern is the right person to continue Eelco’s work and to shape the future development of OAPEN. The Board thanks Eelco for his accomplishments and we wish him the very best.”

“I feel very privileged to continue the great work that Eelco Ferwerda and his team have delivered for a decade now,” said Niels Stern. “OAPEN and DOAB are key services for scholarly open access book publishing. The number of books and their usage on the new platform is increasing rapidly, and both OAPEN and DOAB are deeply engaged in many exciting projects and networks, e.g. the OPERAS network. The momentum for OA books is rising. Being part of the SCOSS campaign adds to this momentum for OAPEN and DOAB. I look very much forward to contributing to the further development of OAPEN and DOAB to the benefit of the community for scholarly book publishing.”

Eelco Ferwerda said: “I have been very fortunate to have had a role in the development of OAPEN and DOAB and it has been a joy to work with so many people from all over the world with a passion for open access. I am thrilled that Niels is taking over and can’t imagine anyone better suited to lead OAPEN and DOAB in the years ahead. Although I am now retiring, I do hope to remain involved in OAPEN and DOAB in new ways, and do new things in the area of OA books.”

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leaf-cutting-ant-body-armor-mineral-exoskeleton-fight">Mineral body armor helps some leaf-cutting ants win fights with bigger kin</a></h4>

<p>Leaf-cutting worker ants might look like they’d be helpless against an enemy soldier ant many times their size. But some of the smaller ants have a secret: Their entire body is coated with a thin but tough layer of mineral armor.</p>



<p>It’s the first time that this type of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19566-3">external, whole-body mineralization</a> has been found in an adult insect, researchers report online November 24 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“I found rock ants,” evolutionary biologist Hongjie Li recalls telling his colleague, evolutionary biologist Cameron Currie, when the first experimental results of the hard coating came in. “I can still feel the excitement now,” Li says.</p>



<p>The discovery was serendipitous, says Currie, of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who has been studying leaf-cutting ants for more than 20 years. His lab had been examining interactions between ants and their external microbes, which are thought to play a pivotal role in the ants’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insects-ants-extreme-farming-methods-offer-good-bad-lessons">farming practices</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>), when the team encountered a white sheen on the exoskeletons of <em>Acromyrmex echinatior </em>worker ants.</p>





<p>That coating needed to come off so the researchers could examine the structure of the exoskeleton in greater detail. So Currie tasked Li, then a postdoctoral student in Currie’s lab who’s now at Ningbo University in China, with removing it. But nothing seemed to work, suggesting the coating wasn’t a wax or other carbon-based compound. Then, while brushing his teeth, Li had an epiphany: mouthwash. It helps remove all sorts of food residue without harming the tongue, and can dissolve mineral deposits on teeth, so Li decided to give the liquid a try.</p>



<p>The mouthwash did the trick, and also gave the team its first clue that the coating was mineral in nature. Further chemical, X-ray and microscopic examinations revealed a thin layer of calcite containing high levels of magnesium.</p>



<p>To see how protective the armor is, the researchers tested the hardness of the ant exoskeleton by poking armored and nonarmored pieces until an indentation formed. Despite being a mere 7 percent of the overall thickness of the exoskeleton, the calcite coating at least doubles the exoskeleton’s hardness, the team found.</p>



<p>The discovery is surprising, says Duncan Murdock, a paleobiologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, though perhaps not wholly unexpected, he adds. That’s because ants are distant cousins of crabs and other crustaceans, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12614">which generally have mineralized exoskeletons</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how the armor is made, though Currie thinks bacteria are involved. If so, this could be another way the ants’ microbiome makes a huge difference to the insects’ survival.</p>



<p>The team also tested how well the armor protected the ants in fights with other, bigger ant species. In staged battles between a trio of workers and a solitary soldier ant from a different species, <em>Atta cephalotes</em>, this mineral armor singlehandedly tipped the scale in the workers’ favor, the researchers say. Nearly all the ants that were raised not to produce armor were killed by the soldier ant, while the vast majority of the armored ants survived.  </p>

Carlson; H. Li et al/<em>Nature Communications </em>2020</span></figure>



<p>Robert Schofield, a biophysicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, isn’t convinced by the battle data, and wonders whether the armorless ants had other differences that may have led to their demise. Still, he’s intrigued, and plans to investigate similar coatings he’s seen on other leaf-cutting ants.</p>



<p>Currie plans to examine other ants as well, in the hopes of determining how widespread the armor phenomenon is. Figuring out how the thin but tough coating forms, he says, could one day prove useful to people in developing protective coatings for all kind of products.   </p>

Brain imaging would show a burst of activity in a region called the nucleus accumbens, in the ventral striatum, a region known to code the impact of reward-related stimuli, such as getting money. But how the brain handles so-called vicarious joy — the type you might feel if you scraped winning panels from a relative’s scratch card, or even a stranger’s — is not well understood. Now a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00839-9">new study</a>, published in <em>Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioural Neuroscience</em>, shows that while there are similarities, there are also some important differences. Notably, the participants’ brains responded differently when they won money for their mother versus their father.</p>



<span id="more-40903"></span>



<p>Philip Bradner at Erasmus University in the Netherlands led the study of 30 mostly undergraduate students, with an average age of 22. They all had a mother and a father as their parents, and none had a history of mental health issues. (In fact, they were deliberately chosen to be similar, to make for a more homogenous sample.)</p>



<p>While in an fMRI scanner, the participants played a simple game in which they, or one other person, could win money. In each trial, this other “player” was identified as either their mother, father, or simply as a “stranger”. All the participants had to do was click a button to choose which of two animated curtains to open. This revealed a small win for themselves and/or the other person. (And any money won for themselves or their mother or father was passed on.) After this, the participants rated how emotionally close they felt to their mother, father and to strangers, in general. They also reported on how much they liked winning for themselves, or for each parent or a stranger.</p>



<p>As expected from earlier research, when a participant won money for themselves, Bradner and his colleagues saw increased activity in the nucleus accumbens. But they also discovered greater activation in the nucleus accumbens when the participants won money for their mother or father, compared to when they won money for a stranger. The participants also reported “liking” winning for both parents more than for a stranger. This suggests that the nucleus accumbens is involved in feeling both direct, personal joy and also vicarious joy.</p>



<p>However, the participants’ brain responses also showed some differences depending on whether the other player was identified as their father or mother. When they won money for their father (but not their mother), other regions of the brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus, became more active.</p>



<p>These regions seem, then, to be important for processing vicarious joy for fathers. They are also known to be important for representing “self” vs “other” — for distinguishing between what we are experiencing directly, versus what someone else is experiencing, for example. It’s possible, then, that winning for fathers triggers stronger self/other comparisons than winning for mothers, the team writes. For these young people, at least, it seems that their mother was more integrated with their “self” representation.</p>



<p>This theory was supported by the additional finding that when participants won money for themselves and their father won nothing, there was less activation in the nucleus accumbens compared with when they won money and their mother didn’t. If winning against a father triggers greater self/other comparisons, then participants may process this win as a gain only for themselves, and as a relative “loss” for their father — but when the mother is the other player, winning might be a more straightforward, unmitigated joy.</p>



<p>The study does have various limitations. For one, because the participants were deliberately chosen to be similar, it’s not clear whether the results would hold for other groups of people, such as those with same-sex parents or from single parent households. It would also be interesting to explores effects in children of less well-adjusted families, who may feel less close to their parents, and may not experience vicarious joy in the same way. But the finding of differences in how the participants’ brains responded to rewards for fathers versus mothers is certainly interesting. If it isn’t driven by differences in emotional closeness, which it doesn’t seem to be, what, exactly, does drive it? Only further research will tell. As the team concludes, “An intriguing question for future research concerns the divergence in neural processing between mothers and fathers.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wrinkle-faced-bats-male-face-mask-sex-appeal-mating">A face mask may turn up a male wrinkle-faced bat’s sex appeal</a></h4>

<p>For tips on how to flirt while wearing a mask, take notes from nature’s experts: male wrinkle-faced bats. The first video of a wrinkle-faced sexual encounter shows a male covering his face with a masklike flap of skin while wooing and then, at a strategic moment, dropping the mask.</p>



<p>Even the basics of how bats mate — whether a male stakes out territory and advertises, or females just shop among a crowd of show-offs — remain a mystery in more than 90 percent of the world’s 1,400 bat species, says mammologist <a href="https://vinv.ucr.ac.cr/sigpro/web/researchers/107670567">Bernal Rodríguez-Herrera</a> of the University of Costa Rica in San José. So it was a stroke of luck when a tip from nature guides in 2018 led him to the first scientific observations of courtship in one of the more elusive bats in the Western hemisphere’s tropics, the wrinkle-faced bat, <em>Centurio senex</em>.</p>



<p>Males, but not females, grow loose folds of mostly white fur below the chin that look like a pulled-down neck gaiter. A male can use his skinny thumbs to tug the fur flap up over his chin and mouth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>For the first time, researchers have videoed the mysterious masked mate-courting of a male wrinkle-faced bat (<em>Centurio senex</em>).  With his natural white furry face mask in the cover-up position, a male dangles in a Costa Rican rainforest, calling ultrasonically for female attention. When a female swoops in, he drops his mask before they mate, then uses his skinny thumbs to tug the fur flap up over his chin and mouth once the female has moved on. Still a puzzle: What is it about the mask that helps a male woo?</figure>



<p>It doesn’t seem likely that only males would need covers for chilly chins. Single-sex excesses often are for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/male-peacocks-keep-eyes-low-when-checking-out-competition">showing off, like peacock feathers</a> fanned out in competition for female favor (<em>SN: 6/16/15</em>). Now a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241063">lucky first look at wrinkle-faced courtship</a> suggests that the masks somehow play into a wooing competition, Rodríguez-Herrera and colleagues report November 11 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>





<p>For weeks, researchers watched male bats convene in the forest from about 6 p.m. until midnight, hanging upside down in particular spots with their masks on. Other bats occasionally flapped close briefly, but researchers couldn’t tell why.</p>



<p>The dangling males, it turned out, were singing. Human hearing picks up lots of tropical night sounds, such as the calls of frogs and owls, but not bats. Bat-recording instruments, however, revealed a great roaring ultrasonic bat songs. The sounds dipped into the range of human hearing only when a flyby visitor made a quick intrusion. The males also “move the tips of the wings, constantly,” he says. He can’t tell if the wing rustling contributes any sound, but “we think it’s part of the courtship display.”</p>





<p>Seeing males gather in a specific place to sing suggests to Rodríguez-Herrera that the wrinkle-nosed species takes a singles bar approach to mating, so far rarely reported among bats. More scientifically known as lekking, males cluster and display while females shop for a contributor of genes to the next generation. Help raising the resulting offspring is not on offer.</p>



<p>For weeks, these male bats in Costa Rica spent evenings rubbing wings and singing upside down. The pale mask might work as a visual lure in dim light or might play a role in wafting scents, a romantic feature in some other bats’ courtships. Or maybe the flap “helps sound resonance,” Rodríguez-Herrera muses. “We do not know.”</p>



<p>What the researchers finally saw was one wrinkle-nosed mating. A female landed on a male’s perch. The two faced each other briefly. And as he repositioned himself for intimate contact, his mask went down.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">Immunity to COVID-19 may persist six months or more</a></h4>

<p>As coronavirus cases in the United States and around the world rise, scientists are uncovering hints that immunity for those who have had COVID-19 can last at least six months, if not longer.</p>



<p>After people with COVID-19 have largely recovered, immune proteins called antibodies are still detectable six months later. What’s more, the proteins have <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.367391v1">sharpened their skills</a> at fighting the coronavirus, researchers report in a preliminary study posted November 5 at bioRxiv.org. Leftover pieces of the virus remaining in the gut after symptoms have disappeared may help the immune system work to refine that response.</p>



<p>The finding also bodes well for how long a vaccination might provide protection. Immunity from a vaccine is expected to last as long or longer than natural immunity.</p>



<p>Antibodies, which are immune proteins that bind to microbes to fight off an infection, are part of the body’s cache of immune defenses. People typically make a wide variety of antibodies during an infection. These proteins can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">recognize different surfaces on viruses</a> — like a Swiss Army knife able to work on various parts of the virus — and evolve over time to better recognize their target (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>).</p>

<p>Six months after an infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, called SARS-CoV-2, people appear to have built an arsenal of antibodies that are not only more potent than the ones developed early on, similar to what has been seen in other infections. Those antibodies can also recognize mutated versions of the virus, researchers found. In addition to antibody upgrades, long-lasting immune cells that make antibodies, called memory B cells, stick around in the blood, poised to launch a rapid response should people be exposed to the virus again.</p>



<p>“The main message is that the immune response persists,” says Julio Lorenzi, a viral immunologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City. “We see these B cells surviving over time and the antibodies six months after infection are even better than the beginning of the infection.”</p>



<p>In the study, Lorenzi and colleagues analyzed the antibodies that 87 people made against the coronavirus at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9">one</a> and six months after developing symptoms. Although antibody levels in the blood waned, the immune proteins were still detectable after six months. Importantly, levels of memory B cells were stable, an assessment of 21 of the 87 participants showed — a sign that those cells may remain in the body for a while.</p>



<p>Other studies have hinted that B cells can <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.385252v1">persist for more than six months</a> in recovered COVID-19 patients. Preliminary results of one study uncovered that memory B cells — as well as other cells involved in immune memory known as T cells — <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.383323v1">decline slowly</a> in the blood, researchers reported November 16 at bioRxiv.org. That slow decrease could mean that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-herd-immunity-immune-response-antibodies">immunity</a> might last for years, at least in some people (<em>SN: 10/19/20</em>).      </p>



<p>What’s more, Lorenzi and his team found, B cells refined the antibodies they made over a five-month time span to generate proteins that are better at recognizing the coronavirus. In an analysis of cells from six people, the researchers discovered changes in the genetic instructions that B cells use to make antibodies, a sign that the B cells were making new variations.</p>

<p>Some of the newer antibodies were better at stopping viruses from infecting new cells, and some could even attach to viruses with mutations in the spike protein, which helps the coronavirus break into host cells. Such widely binding antibodies could make it harder for the virus to escape recognition by the immune system.          </p>



<p>The findings are encouraging, experts say, although it’s still unclear whether people with signs of immunity such as antibodies are completely protected from reinfection — called sterilizing immunity — or whether they would just become less severely ill if reinfected.</p>



<p>“When the first studies started coming out about antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, everyone was in an uproar about the response being potentially defective,” says Nina Luning Prak, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Earlier results had hinted that antibody-generating B cells were poorly trained to make the immune proteins, perhaps because structures called germinal centers that teach the cells what parts of a virus the antibodies should bind to didn’t properly form.</p>



<p>That may have left it up to other immune signals besides germinal centers to activate B cells, leading to the production of less effective antibodies that might latch onto parts of the virus weakly. “As a result, [some scientists thought that] perhaps [B cells] made antibodies that were not so great,” Luning Prak says.</p>



<p>But that may be part of a normal immune response, Luning Prak says. Or defective germinal centers might appear in the most severe COVID-19 cases where “it’s an all-hands-on-deck style immune response” with lots of inflammation. When people survive the infection, researchers are now beginning to find that “when you look [at COVID-19 patients] six months out, antibody responses look far more conventional,” she says.</p>



<p>B cells may learn how to make better SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over time, with the help of a store of viral proteins that stays hidden in the gut after the virus is cleared from the rest of the body. Since the pandemic’s early days, researchers have documented the presence of coronavirus genetic material in the stool of some infected people.</p>



<p>In the new study, seven of 14 recovered COVID-19 patients had evidence of coronaviruses in their intestinal tissue, the researchers found. Electron microscopy images of a sample from one patient revealed what look like intact virus particles adorned with a crown of spike proteins, a distinctive feature of coronaviruses.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s unclear whether the viral bits seen in the gut are in fact helping the immune system evolve to better recognize the coronavirus, much less whether those pieces come from infectious or dead viruses, Lorenzi says. “That’s a possibility,” but researchers need to study more people to figure that out.</p>

<p>A COVID-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford appears to prevent illness and may cut down on transmission of the coronavirus.</p>



<p>In studies of more than 22,000 people in the United Kingdom and Brazil, the vaccine was <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html">90 percent effective</a> in preventing COVID-19 when people got a half dose of the vaccine followed by a full dose one month later, AstraZeneca said November 23 in a news release.</p>



<p>When participants got two full doses of the vaccine one month apart, its effectiveness dropped to about 62 percent, the company reported. It’s not clear why the half dose followed by a full dose worked better than two full doses. Overall, the combined results showed that the vaccine had an average effectiveness of 70 percent among those who got the vaccine, compared with people in a control group who got a meningococcal vaccine or a placebo.</p>

<p>The vaccine is the third one in recent weeks to show safety and effectiveness in clinical trials. AstraZeneca’s vaccine may be easier to distribute than those from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results">Pfizer</a> and its German collaborator BioNTech and from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results">Moderna</a> because the vaccine doesn’t <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">need to be frozen</a> as the other two do (<em>SN: 11/16/20; SN: 11/18/20</em>; <em>SN: 11/20/20</em>). It can be stored at temperatures found in regular refrigerators, unlike the special freezers needed for the Pfizer vaccine.</p>



<p>AstraZeneca says it has the capacity to produce 3 billion doses of its vaccine in 2021.</p>



<p>In the new AstraZeneca/Oxford analysis, there were 131 cases of the disease. No hospitalizations or severe cases of the disease were reported among people who got the vaccine, AstraZeneca said. The results were reported in a news release and have not been reviewed yet by independent scientists.</p>



<p>Unlike Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines, the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is not based on mRNA, a cousin of DNA. Instead, researchers at Oxford and a university spin-off company called Vaccitech started with a weakened version of an adenovirus that causes colds in chimpanzees. This same chimpanzee adenovirus was used to make an Ebola vaccine. To fight the coronavirus, the chimp virus was engineered to infect, but not replicate in, human cells.</p>



<p>When it infects cells, the engineered chimp virus<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response"> delivers instructions </a> for making the iconic knobby “spike” protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Human cells then make the spike protein, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if the person encounters it later.</p>

<p>It is encouraging that different types of vaccines all seem to work well at protecting against COVID-19, says Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.</p>



<p>What’s more, the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine cuts transmission of the virus by reducing the number of asymptomatic infections, the vaccine developers reported. “That’s critical because we know that a lot of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from asymptomatic people,” said Gandhi during a Nov. 23 news briefing of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. It’s unclear whether the vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna reduce transmission.</p>



<p>The FDA recommends that COVID-19 vaccines have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean">at least 50 percent efficacy</a>, meaning a vaccine should reduce COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people compared with a placebo by half (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). Pfizer, Moderna and now AstraZeneca/Oxford have all reported rates higher than that 50 percent threshold.</p>



<p>“I’m thrilled that several different vaccines look like they’re showing [efficacy] at rates that are higher than what we [set] as the benchmark,” Gandhi said. “These well exceed that, so I think that’s great news.”</p>



<p>AstraZeneca’s vaccine is still being tested in the United States, Japan, South Africa, Kenya, Russia and Latin America with future trials planned in other European and Asian countries. Previously, trials were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-pause-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-trial">briefly halted</a> because of a neurological illness in a volunteer in the UK trial, but resumed after regulatory agencies deemed it was safe to do so (<em>SN: 9/9/20</em>).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lonely-brains-social-isolation-people-mental-health">Lonely brains crave people like hungry brains crave food</a></h4>

<p>A hungry brain craves food. A lonely brain craves people. After spending a day completely isolated from anyone else, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00742-z">people’s brains perked up at the sight of social gatherings</a>, like a hungry person’s brain seeing food, scientists report November 23 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>.</p>



<p>Cognitive neuroscientist Livia Tomova, then at MIT, and her colleagues had 40 participants fast for 10 hours. At the end of the day, certain nerve cells in the midbrain fired up in response to pictures of pizza and chocolate cake. Those neurons — in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/need-feed-and-eating-pleasure-are-inextricably-linked">produce dopamine</a>, a chemical messenger associated with reward (<em>SN: 8/27/15</em>).</p>



<p>On a different day, the same people underwent 10 hours of isolation (no friends, no Facebook and no Instagram). That evening, neurons in the same spot activated in response to pictures of people chatting or playing team sports. The more hunger or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kay-tye-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">isolation</a> the subject reported, the stronger the effect (<em>SN: 10/4/17</em>).</p>



<p>In people who reported that they were generally more lonely, the social responses were blunted. “We don’t really know what causes that,” Tomova says. “Maybe being isolated doesn’t really affect them as much, because it’s something that is not that different, perhaps, from their everyday life.”</p>



<p>The midbrain, which plays an important role in people’s motivation to seek food, friends, gambling or drugs, responds to food and social signals even when people aren’t hungry or lonely. After all, a person always could eat or hang out. But hunger and loneliness increased the reaction and made people’s responses specific to the thing they were missing.</p>



<p>The findings “speak to our current state,” says Tomova, now at the University of Cambridge. COVID-19 has left many more socially isolated, putting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-psychological-fallout">mental as well as physical health at stake</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/20</em>) and leaving people with cravings for more than food. “It’s important to look at the social dimension of this kind of crisis.”</p>

<p>Isaac Newton’s 17th century book, the <em>Principia</em>, gave the famed English scientist a reputation: “[T]here goes the man that writt a book that neither he nor any body else understands,” a Cambridge student is said to have remarked as Newton passed by one day.</p>



<p>Likewise, historians have assumed that only a select few scientists and mathematicians were able to comprehend the highly technical book, which introduced game-changing physics concepts such as the universal law of gravitation.</p>



<p>But a new census, described September 2 in <em>Annals of Science</em>, of the remaining copies of the book’s first edition suggests that the student’s quip was misleading. “An anecdote only tells you part of the story,” says study coauthor and historian of science Mordechai Feingold of Caltech.</p>



<p>A 1950s search found only 189 copies of the first edition, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/celebrating-newton">published in 1687</a> under the full title <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em> (<em>SN: 7/4/87</em>). But Feingold and his former student Andrej Svorenčík, now at the University of Mannheim in Germany, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tasc20/77/3?nav=tocList">unearthed 386 copies</a>, suggesting a more substantial readership.</p>



<p>By tracking down original owners and studying the annotations that readers made, the researchers conclude that, in addition to scientists, well-educated laypeople were reading the book too.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bible-warrior-goliath-david-not-giant-height-gath">The biblical warrior Goliath may not have been so giant after all</a></h4>

<p>Early versions of the Bible describe Goliath — an ancient Philistine warrior best known as the loser of a fight with the future King David — as a giant whose height in ancient terms reached four cubits and a span. But don’t take that measurement literally, new research suggests.</p>



<p>Archaeological findings at biblical-era sites including Goliath’s home city, a prominent <a href="https://gath.wordpress.com/about/gath-in-the-bible/">Philistine settlement called Gath</a>, indicate that those ancient measurements work out to 2.38 meters, or 7 feet, 10 inches. That’s equal to the width of walls forming a gateway into Gath that were unearthed in 2019, according to archaeologist Jeffrey Chadwick of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.</p>



<p>Rather than standing taller than any NBA player ever, Goliath was probably described metaphorically by an Old Testament writer as a warrior who matched the size and strength of Gath’s defensive barrier, Chadwick said November 19 at the virtual annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.asor.org/am/">American Schools of Oriental Research</a>.</p>



<p>People known as Canaanites first occupied Gath in the early Bronze Age, roughly 4,700 to 4,500 years ago. The city was rebuilt more than a millennium later by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-cemetery-provides-peek-philistines-lives-health">the Philistines, known from the Old Testament as enemies of the Israelites</a> (<em>SN: 11/22/16</em>). Gath reached its peak during the Iron Age around 3,000 years ago, the time of biblical references to Goliath. Scholars continue to debate whether David and Goliath were real people who met in battle around that time.</p>



<p>The remains of Gath are found at a site called Tell es-Safi in Israel. A team led by archaeologist Aren Maeir of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel — who Chadwick collaborated with to excavate the Gath gateway — has investigated Tell es-Safi since 1996. Other discoveries at Gath include a pottery fragment inscribed with two names possibly related to the name Goliath. Evidence of Gath’s destruction about 2,850 years ago by an invading army has also been recovered.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Iron Age gateway at et-Tell" class="wp-image-3093785" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/112020_bb_goliath_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093785">Each of four inner pillars of an Iron Age gateway at et-Tell (possibly the biblical city of Bethsaida), including this one, measures 2.38 meters, or four cubits and a span, wide. That’s the same width as walls at Goliath’s home city, Gath, and the same height that an Old Testament writer used to describe Goliath.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093785">Eric Welch</span></figure>



<p>Archaeologists have long known that in ancient Egypt a cubit corresponded to 52.5 centimeters and assumed that the same measure was used at Gath and elsewhere in and around ancient Israel. But careful evaluations of many excavated structures over the last several years have revealed that standard measures differed slightly between the two regions, Chadwick said.</p>



<p>Buildings at Gath and several dozen other cities from ancient Israel and nearby kingdoms of Judah and Philistia, excavated by other teams, were constructed based on three primary measurements, Chadwick has found. Those include a 54-centimeter cubit (versus the 52.5-centimeter Egyptian cubit), a 38-centimeter short cubit and a 22-centimeter span that corresponds to the distance across an adult’s outstretched hand.</p>





<p>Dimensions of masonry at these sites display various combinations of the three measurements, Chadwick said. At a settlement called et-Tell in northern Israel, for instance, two pillars at the front of the city gate are each 2.7 meters wide, or five 54-centimeter cubits. Each of four inner pillars at the city gate measure 2.38 meters wide, or four 54-centimeter cubits and a 22-centimeter span. Excavators of et-Tell regard it as the site of <a href="https://bethsaidaarchaeology.org/about/">a biblical city called Bethsaida</a>.</p>



<p>Chadwick’s 2019 excavations found one of presumably several gateways that allowed access to Gath through the city’s defensive walls. Like the inner pillars of et-Tell’s city gate, Gath’s gate walls measured 2.38 meters wide, or four cubits and a span, the same as Goliath’s biblical stature.</p>



<p>“The ancient writer used a real architectural metric from that time to describe Goliath’s height, likely to indicate that he was as big and strong as his city’s walls,” Chadwick said.</p>



<p>Although the research raises the possibility that Goliath’s recorded size referred to the width of a city wall, Chadwick “will need to do more research to move this beyond an intriguing idea,” says archaeologist and Old Testament scholar Gary Arbino of Gateway Seminary in Mill Valley, Calif. For one thing, Arbino suggests, it needs to be established that the measure applied to Goliath, four cubits and a span, was commonly used at the time as a phrase that figuratively meant “big and strong.”</p>

<p>Steven Miller is a math professor at <a href="https://www.williams.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Williams College</a> who specializes in number theory and theoretical probability theory. A few days ago he published a “<a href="https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/Miller_DeclarationAndAnalyisPA_GOP_BallotRequestData_2020_Final.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">declaration</a>” in which he performs an “analysis” of phone bank data of registered Republicans in Pennsylvania. The data was provided to him by Matt Braynyard, who led  Trump’s data team during the 2016. Miller frames his “analysis” as an attempt to “estimate the number of fraudulent ballots in Pennsylvania”, and his analysis of the data leads him to conclude that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“almost surely…the number of ballots requested by someone other than the registered Republican is between 37,001 and 58,914, and almost surely the number of ballots requested by registered Republicans and returned but not counted is in the range from 38,910 to 56,483.”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>A review of Miller’s “analysis” leads me to conclude that his estimates are fundamentally flawed and that the data as presented provide no evidence of voter fraud.</strong></p>



<p>This conclusion is easy to arrive at. The declaration claims (without a reference) that there were 165,412 mail-in ballots requested by registered Republicans in PA, but that “had not arrived to be counted” as of November 16th, 2020. The data Miller analyzed was based on an attempt to call some of these registered Republicans by phone to assess what happened to their ballots. The number of phone calls made, according to the declaration, is 23,184 = 17,000 + 3,500 + 2,684. The number 17,000 consists of phone calls that did not provide information either because an answering machine picked up instead of a person, or a person picked up and summarily hung up. 3,500 numbers were characterized as “bad numbers / language barrier”, and 2,684 individuals answered the phone. Curiously, Miller writes that “Almost 20,000 people were called”, when <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in fact</a> 23,184 &gt; 20,000.  </p>



<p>In any case, clearly many of the phone numbers dialed were simply wrong numbers, as evident by the number of “bad” calls: 3,500. It’s easy to imagine how this can happen:  confusion because some individuals share a name, phone numbers have changed, people move, the phone call bank makes an error when dialing etc. Let <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> be the fraction of phone numbers out of the 23,184 that were “bad”, i.e. incorrect. We can estimate <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> by noting that we have some information about it: we know that the 3,500 “bad numbers” were bad (by definition). Additionally, it is reported in the declaration that 556 people literally said that they did not request a ballot, and there is no reason not to take them at their word. We don’t know what fraction of the 17,000 individuals called and did not pick up or hung up were wrong numbers, but we do know that the fraction out of the total must equal the fraction out of the 17,000 + those we know for sure were bad numbers, i.e.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=23184+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+17%2C000+%5Ccdot+b+%2B+556+%2B+3500&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" />. </p>



<p>Solving for <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> we find that <img alt="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" />. I’m surprised the number is so <em>low</em>. One would expect that individuals who requested ballots, but then didn’t send them in, would be enriched for people who have recently moved or are in the process of moving, or have other issues making it difficult to reach them or impossible to reach them at all. </p>



<p>The fraction of bad calls derived translates to about 1,700 bad numbers out of the 2,684 people that were reached. This easily explains not only the 556 individuals who said they did not request a ballot, but also the 463 individuals who said that they mailed back their ballots. In the case of the latter there is no irregularity; the number of bad calls suggests that all those individuals were reached in error and their ballots were legitimately counted so they weren’t part of the 165,412. It also explains the 544 individuals who said they voted in person.</p>



<p>That’s it. The data don’t point to any fraud or irregularity, just a poorly design poll with poor response rates and lots of erroneous information due to bad phone numbers. There is nothing to explain. Miller, on the other hand, has some things to explain.</p>



<p>First, I note that his declaration begins with a signed page asserting various facts about Steven Miller and the analysis he performed. Notably absent from the page, or anywhere else in the document, is a disclosure of funding source for the work and of conflicts of interest. On his <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">work webpage</a>, Miller specifically states that one should <strong>always acknowledge funding support</strong>.</p>



<p>Second, if Miller <em>really</em> wanted to understand the reason why some ballots were requested for mail-in, but had not yet arrived to be counted, he would also obtain data from Democrats. That would provide a control on various aspects of the analysis, and help to establish whether irregularities, if they were to be detected, were of a partisan nature. Why did Miller not include an analysis of such data?</p>



<p>Third, one might wonder why Steven Miller chose to publish this “declaration”. Surely a professor who has taught probability and statistics for 15 years (as Miller claims he has) must understand that his own “analysis” is fundamentally flawed, right? Then again, I’ve previously found that excellent pure mathematicians are prone to falling into a data analysis trap, i.e. a situation where their lack of experience analyzing real-world datasets leads them to believe naïve analysis that is deeply flawed. To better understand whether this might be the case with Miller, I examined his publication record, which he has shared publicly via <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Scholar, to see whether he has worked with data. The first thing I noticed </a>was that he has published more than 700 articles (!) and has an h-index of 47 for a total of 8,634 citations… an incredible record for any professor, and especially for a mathematician. A Google search for his name displays this impressive number of citations: </p>

<p>As it turns out, his impressive publication record  is a mirage. When I took a closer look and found that many of the papers he lists on his Google Scholar page are not his, but rather articles published by other authors with the name S Miller. <strong>“His” most cited article was published in 1955, a year that transpired well before he was born.</strong> Miller’s own most cited paper is a short unpublished tutorial on least squares (I was curious and reviewed it as well only to find some inaccuracies but hey, I don’t work for this guy).</p>



<p>I will note that in creating his Google Scholar page, Miller did not just enter his name and email address (required). He went to the effort of customizing the page, including the addition of keywords and a link to his homepage, and in doing so followed his own <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">general advice </a>to curate one’s CV (strangely, he also dispenses advice on job interviews, including about shaving- I guess only women interview for jobs?). But I digress: the question is, why is his Google Scholar page display massively inflated publication statistics based on papers that are not his? <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/11/18/how-many-doubly-manlocked-scientists-are-there/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">I’ve seen this before</a>, and in one case where I had hard evidence that it was done deliberately to mislead I reported it as fraud.  Regardless of Miller’s motivations, by looking at his actual publications I confirmed what I suspected, namely that he has hardly any experience analyzing real world data. I’m willing to chalk up his embarrassing “declaration” to statistics illiteracy and naïveté.</p>



<p>In summary, Steven Miller’s declaration provides no evidence whatsoever of voter fraud in Pennsylvania.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines like Pfizer’s need to be kept so cold</a></h4>

<p>Pfizer is racing to get approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">applying for emergency use authorization</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on November 20. But the pharmaceutical giant faces a huge challenge in distributing its vaccine, which has to be kept an ultrafrosty –70° Celsius, requiring special storage freezers and shipping containers.</p>



<p>It “has some unique storage requirements,” says Kurt Seetoo, the immunization program manager at the Maryland Department of Public Health in Baltimore. “We don’t normally store vaccines at that temperature, so that definitely is a challenge.”</p>



<p>That means that even though the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech is likely to be the first vaccine to reach the finish line in the United States, its adoption may ultimately be limited. The FDA’s committee overseeing vaccines will <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-covid-19-vaccine">meet on December 10</a> to discuss the emergency use request. That meeting will be streamed live on the agency’s web site and YouTube, Facebook and Twitter channels.</p>



<p>The companies are also seeking authorization to distribute the vaccine in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and other parts of the world, making its deep-freeze problem a global challenge.</p>

<p>A similar vaccine developed by Moderna and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also requires freezing. But it survives at a balmier <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-longer-shelf-life-its-covid-19-vaccine">–20° C, so can be kept in a standard freezer</a>, and can even be stored at refrigerator temperatures for up to a month.. Most vaccines don’t require freezing at all, but both Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are a new type of vaccine for which the low temperatures are necessary to keep the vaccines from breaking down and becoming useless.</p>



<p>Both vaccines are based on messenger RNA, or mRNA, which carries instructions for building copies of the coronavirus’ spike protein. Human cells read those instructions and produce copies of the protein, which, in turn prime the immune system to attack the coronavirus should it come calling.</p>



<p>So why does Pfizer’s vaccine need to be frozen at sub-Antarctica temperatures and Moderna’s does not?</p>



<p>Answering that question requires some speculation. The companies aren’t likely to reveal all the tricks and commercial secrets they used to make the vaccines, says Sanjay Mishra, a protein chemist and data scientist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>



<p>But there are at least four things that may determine how fragile an mRNA vaccine is and how deeply it needs to be frozen to keep it fresh and effective. How the companies addressed those four challenges is likely the key to how cold the vaccines need to be, Mishra says.</p>



<p>The cold requirement conundrum starts with the difference in chemistry between RNA and its cousin, DNA.</p>



<p>One reason RNA is much less stable than DNA is due to an important difference in the sugars that make up the molecules’ backbones. RNA’s spine is a sugar called ribose, while DNA’s is deoxyribose. The difference: DNA is missing an oxygen molecule. As a result, “DNA can survive for generations,” Mishra says, but RNA is much more transient. “And for biology, that’s a good thing.”</p>



<p>When cells have a job to do, they usually need to call proteins into service. But like most manufacturers, cells don’t have a stockpile of proteins. They have to make new batches each time. The recipe for making proteins is stored in DNA.</p>



<p>Rather than risk damaging DNA recipes by putting them on the molecular kitchen counter while cooking up a batch of proteins, cells instead make RNA copies of the recipe. Those copies are read by cellular machinery and used to produce proteins.</p>

<p>Like a <em>Mission Impossible</em> message that self-destructs once it has been played, many RNAs are quickly degraded once read. Quickly disposing of RNA is one way to control how much of a particular protein is made. There are a host of enzymes dedicated to RNA’s destruction floating around inside cells and nearly everywhere else. Sticking RNA-based vaccines in the blast freezer prevents such enzymes from tearing apart the RNA and rendering the vaccine inert.</p>



<p>Another way the molecules’ stability differs lies in their architecture. DNA’s dual strands twine into a graceful double helix. But RNA goes it alone in a single strand that pairs with itself in some spots, creating fantastical shapes reminiscent of lollipops, hair pins and traffic circles. Those “secondary structures” can make some RNAs more fragile than others.</p>



<p>Yet another place that DNA’s and RNA’s chemical differences make things hard on RNA is the part of the molecules that spell out the instructions and ingredients of the recipe. The information-carry subunits of the molecules are known as nucleotides. DNA’s nucleotides are often represented by the letters A, T, C and G for adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. RNA uses the same A, C and G, but in place of thymine it has a different letter: uracil, or U.</p>



<p>“Uracil is a problem because it juts out,” Mishra says. Those jutting Us are like a flag waving to special immune system proteins called Toll-like receptors. Those proteins help detect RNAs from viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and slate the invaders for destruction.</p>



<p>All these ways mRNA can fall apart or get waylaid by the immune system create an obstacle course for vaccine makers. The companies need to ensure that the RNA stays intact long enough to get into cells and bake up batches of spike protein. Both Moderna and Pfizer probably tinkered with the RNA’s chemistry to make a vaccine that could get the job done: Both have reported that their vaccines are about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results">95 percent effective</a> at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results">preventing illness in clinical trials</a> (<em>SN: 11/16/20</em>; <em>SN: 11/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>While the details of each company’s approach aren’t known, they both probably fiddled slightly with the chemical letters of the mRNAs in order to make it easier for human cellular machinery to read the instructions. The companies also need to add additional RNA — a cap and tail — flanking the spike protein instructions to make the molecule stable and readable in human cells. That tampering may have disrupted or created secondary structures that could affect the RNA’s stability, Mishra says.</p>





<p>The uracil problem can be dealt with by adding a modified version of the nucleotide, which Toll-like receptors overlook, sparing the RNA from an initial immune system attack so that the vaccine has a better chance of making the protein that will build immune defenses against the virus. Exactly which modified version of uracil the companies may have introduced into the vaccine could also affect RNA stability, and thus the temperature at which each vaccine needs to be stored.</p>



<p>Finally, by itself, an RNA molecule is beneath a cell’s notice because it’s just too small, Mishra says. So the companies coat the mRNA with an emulsion of lipids, creating little bubbles known as lipid nanoparticles. Those nanoparticles need to big enough that cells will grab them, bring them inside and break open the particle to release the RNA.</p>



<p>Some types of lipids stand up to heat better than others. It’s “like regular oil versus fat. You know how lard is solid at room temperature” while oil is liquid, Mishra says. For nanoparticles, “what they’re made of makes a giant difference in how stable they will be in general to [maintain] the things inside.” The lipids the companies used could make a big difference in the vaccine’s ability to stand heat.</p>



<p>The need for ultracold storage might ultimately limit how many people end up getting vaccinated with Pfizer’s vaccine. “We anticipate that this Pfizer vaccine is pretty much only going to be used in this early phase,” Seetoo says.</p>



<p>The first wave of immunizations is expected to go to health care workers and other essential employees, such as firefighters and police, and to people who are at high risk of becoming severely ill or dying of COVID-19 should they contract it such as elderly people living in nursing facilities.</p>



<p>Pfizer has told health officials that the vaccine can be stored in special shipping containers that are recharged with dry ice for 15 days and stay refrigerated for another five days after thawing, Seetoo says. That gives health officials 20 days to get the vaccine into people’s arms once it’s delivered. But Moderna’s vaccine and a host of others that are still in testing seem to last longer at warmer temperatures. If those vaccines are as effective as Pfizer’s, they may be more attractive candidates in the long run because they don’t need such extreme special handling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-camouflage-people-china-traditional-medicine-fritillaria">These plants seem like they’re trying to hide from people</a></h4>

<p><em>Fritillaria</em> plants should be simple to spot.</p>



<p>The usually bright green plants often stand alone amid the jumbled scree that tops the Himalayan and Hengduan mountains in southwestern China — easy pickings for traditional Chinese medicine herbalists, who’ve ground the bulbs of wild <em>Fritillaria</em> into a popular cough-treating powder for more than 2,000 years. The demand for bulbs is intense, since about 3,500 of them are needed to produce just one kilogram of the powder, worth about $480.</p>



<p>But some <em>Fritillaria</em> are remarkably difficult to find, with living leaves and stems that are barely distinguishable from the gray or brown rocky background. Surprisingly, this plant camouflage seems to have evolved in response to people. <em>Fritillaria delavayi</em> from regions that experience greater harvesting pressure <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.10.078">are more camouflaged than those from less harvested areas</a>, researchers report November 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The new study “is quite convincing,” says Julien Renoult, an evolutionary biologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Montpellier who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a nice first step toward demonstrating that humans seem to be driving the very rapid evolution of camouflage in this species.”</p>





<p>Camouflaged plants are rare, but not unheard of, says Yang Niu, a botanist at the Kunming Institute of Botany in China, who studies cryptic coloration in plants. In wide open areas with little cover, like mountaintops, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/south-american-vine-masterful-mimic">blending in can help plants avoid hungry herbivores</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/14</em>). But after five years of studying camouflage in <em>Fritillaria</em>, Niu found few bite marks on leaves, and he did not spot any animals munching on the plants. “They don’t seem to have natural enemies,” he says.</p>



<p>So Niu, his colleague Hang Sun and sensory ecologist Martin Stevens of the University of Exeter in England decided to see if humans might be driving the evolution of the plants’ camouflage. If so, the more heavily harvested a particular slope, the more camouflaged the plants that live there should be.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, to measure harvesting pressure “you’d have exact measures of exactly how many plants had been collected for hundreds of years” at multiple sites, Stevens says. “But that data is practically nonexistent.”</p>



<p>Luckily, at seven study sites, local herbalists had noted the total weight of bulbs harvested each year from 2014 to 2019. These records provided a measure of contemporary harvesting pressure. To estimate further back in time, the researchers assessed ease of harvesting by recording how long it took to dig up bulbs at six of those sites, plus an additional one. On some slopes, bulbs are easily dug up, but in others they can be buried under stacks of rocks. “Intuitively, areas where it’s easier to harvest should have experienced more harvesting pressure” over time, Stevens says. </p>



<p>Both measures revealed a striking pattern: The more harvested, or harvestable, a site, the better the color of a plant matched its background, as measured by a spectrometer. “The degree of correlation was really, really convincing for both metrics we used,” Stevens says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Fritillaria delavayi plants in a rarely harvested area and a heavily harvested area" class="wp-image-3093749" height="363" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111920_JL_plant-camo_inline-680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093749">These two <em>Fritillaria delavayi</em> plants exemplify color differences among different populations. The green one comes from an area where it isn’t harvested much by people, while the brown one grows in a highly harvested region.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093749">Both: Y. Niu</span></figure>



<p>Human eyes also had a harder time spotting camouflaged plants in an online experiment, suggesting that the camouflage actually works.</p>



<p>Hiding in plain sight may present some challenges for the plant. Pollinators might have a harder time finding camouflaged plants, and the gray and brown coloration could impair photosynthetic activity. Still, despite those potential costs, these <em>F. delavayi</em> show just how adaptable plants can be, Steven says. “The appearance of plants is much more malleable than we might have expected.”</p>

<p>Minuscule shreds and threads of plastic are turning up all over, including in the snow on Mount Everest.</p>



<p>“We’ve known that plastic is in the deep sea, and now it’s on the tallest mountain on Earth,” says Imogen Napper, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth in England and a National Geographic Explorer. “It’s ubiquitous through our whole environment.”</p>



<p>Plastic plays an increasingly large role in our lifestyles: Globally, the use of plastics has shot up from around 5 million metric tons in the 1950s to more than 330 million metric tons in 2020. As they’re used and cast away, these plastic products shed tiny particles. The broken-down bits of bags, bottles and other consumer plastics, each smaller than 5 millimeters, can harm animals, such as marine crabs that get <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-lodge-crab-gills-and-guts">plastics stuck in their gills</a> (<em>SN: 7/8/14</em>). They may also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fewer-worms-live-mud-littered-lots-microplastic-pollution">mess with ecosystems</a> <em>(SN: 1/31/20)</em>.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most extreme places where microplastics have been found.</p>





<h4>Atop the world’s tallest mountain</h4>



<p>All of the 11 snow samples that Napper’s team analyzed from Mount Everest contained plastic, the researchers report November 20 in <em>One Earth. </em>“I had no idea what the results were going to look like … so that really took me aback,” says Napper.</p>



<p>The highest concentration of microplastics — 119,000 pieces per cubic meter — was in snow from Everest Base Camp, where climbers congregate, but plastic pieces also appeared at a spot 8,440 meters above sea level, near the 8,850-meter summit. The scientists also found plastics in three of eight samples of stream water from Everest. Perhaps the finding should not have been so surprising: Hundreds of people attempt to summit the mountain each year, leaving piles of trash behind. The majority of the microplastics found were polyester fibers, likely originating from climbers’ equipment and clothes.</p>



<h4>In the deepest ocean depths</h4>



<p>Plastic pollution in the sea goes far deeper than the floating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-pacific-garbage-patch-new-size-estimates">Pacific garbage patch</a> (<em>SN: 3/22/18</em>). Scientists have fished <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.180667">plastic fibers and fragments from the guts</a> of critters dwelling in ocean trenches around the Pacific Rim. Of 90 crustaceans analyzed in a 2019 study, 65 contained microplastics, with the deepest coming from 10,890 meters down in the Mariana Trench. In another study, a sampling of water in the Monterey Bay suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">plastic debris is accumulating</a> below the surface and is most prevalent at 200 to 600 meters deep (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>).</p>

<h4>Blowing in the wind</h4>



<p>Carried through the air, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-microplastics-travel-far-wind">microplastics can make their way</a> to remote areas such as a meteorological station in the Pyrenees Mountains (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). On average, an estimated 365 microplastic particles per square meter per day rained down on that site during the study period, about as much as falls from the sky in some cities. Simulations of wind directions and speed suggest the plastic fragments traveled at least 95 kilometers before landing at the site.</p>



<h4>Embedded in Arctic ice</h4>



<p>A 2018 study reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03825-5">millions to tens of millions</a> of microplastic pieces per cubic meter from melted Arctic ice cores. The research team identified 17 types of plastic, including some used in packaging materials and others used in paints or fibers. Another 2020 report found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61948-6">lower concentrations for sea ice cores</a>, ranging from 2,000 to 17,000 plastic particles per cubic meter. The 2020 study also found that water beneath ice floes held between 0 to 18 microplastic particles per cubic meter. </p>



<h4>In our guts</h4>



<p>A 2019 study estimates that an average American <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517">consumes between 39,000 and 52,000 pieces</a> of microplastic a year. Researchers came up with this number by drawing on previous studies that had surveyed plastic pieces in tap and bottled water and in certain food items, such as fish, sugar, salt and alcohol.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colugo-flying-lemur-mammal-southeast-asia">On a cool night in Malaysia, scientists track mysterious colugos across the treetops</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">My companions scanned the treetops with binoculars and a thermal-imaging monocular. I stared at the branches and leaves, pretending I knew what to look for. It was a cool June evening just before sunset on a village road on Langkawi Island, Malaysia.</p>



<p>“There’s one! Up there,” one of the biologists called out. I squinted at the spot, about five meters up the tree trunk, and saw only a brown knob speckled with gray. Where? Then the knob stirred. Its top edge rose and turned, and I was staring into a pair of bulging eyes set on a small head with a short snout.</p>



<p>My first colugo. The size of a house cat, colugos are nocturnal mammals that live in trees. Colugos are also called “flying lemurs,” which is a misnomer because they cannot fly and they are not lemurs. A colugo has a cape of skin that stretches from its neck to the tips of its four limbs and tail. That skin, furry on top, helps colugos glide far and hide well in the canopy.</p>



<p>“Wait … Oh, it has a baby!” called zoologist Priscillia Miard of Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang and leader of that evening’s search. She passed me her binoculars as the team discussed the identity of this colugo.</p>





<p>A tiny head popped out from beneath the mother’s fur, like a child peering out from under a blanket. Baby colugos cling to their mother’s furless undersides until about age 6 months, nursing on nipples near mom’s armpits.</p>



<p>I had seen two colugos just 15 minutes into our search!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Recent observations by zoologist Priscillia Miard and others have shown how nocturnal colugos interact with their young as well as their hit-or-miss mating efforts.</figure>



<p>The mother colugo lifted her tail. “It’s pooping,” said Miard, without the slightest note of concern that we were standing right below. Miard later told me that colugo feces are like dried lentils — nothing messy.</p>



<p>For an animal that is the closest living relative to all primates, having branched off about 80 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colugo-genome-reveals-gliders-primate-cousins">colugos remain a big mystery</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/16, p. 17</em>). Today, the two living species of colugos are found only in Southeast Asia, though recent studies suggest that two is an imperfect count. Miard and other scientists have begun to upend what little knowledge exists about these mammals, revealing how colugos communicate and how they glide more than the length of a football field.</p>





<h4>Into the night</h4>



<p>Colugos popped unexpectedly into Miard’s life three years ago. The then 28-year-old French researcher had spent five years in Borneo studying nocturnal primates, including tarsiers and slow lorises. In 2017, Miard visited Langkawi, famous for its beaches and paddy fields, where she saw colugos “everywhere” — in orchards, on golf courses, at resorts and along well-traveled village roads. Because colugos were abundant and easy to find and observe in Langkawi, Miard pivoted to study them. In August, she successfully defended her Ph.D. thesis at Universiti Sains Malaysia for her research on colugo ecology.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Neighbors</h3>



<p>Colugos are found only in Southeast Asia. The Sunda colugo ranges from Vietnam to Indonesia (orange areas, left) and the Philippine colugo lives in the southern Philippines (right).</p>

<p>But as I stood by her side looking up, Miard did not mention her Ph.D. She focused on the mother colugo — now a few dried lentils lighter — which seemed ready to start her night. The colugo climbed to the far end of a branch and turned her head toward the road. Then she leaped.</p>



<p>The colugo spun around, stretched her legs and tail, and glided like a magic carpet across the road to another tree trunk. Then she hopped, hopped, hopped up the tree into the leaves and out of sight.</p>



<p>She glided to four other trees over the next 15 minutes. By then, Miard and her teammates — biologists Muhammad Fizri bin Ahmad Zubir and Célia Lacomme — had recognized the mother colugo’s fur coloration. They had been following her for some time, naming her “Batwoman” because, months ago, locals thought the researchers were looking into the trees for bats.</p>



<p>Streetlights and passing cars and motorcycles lit the road, but a few meters away, the trees were dark. Miard and Lacomme switched on their red-light head lamps to illuminate the treetops. Something moved on a nearby tree trunk. Another colugo! Miard pointed her camera, saw testicles and announced that the colugo was male.</p>



<h4>Master gliders</h4>



<p>All colugos are master gliders, considered among the best of the 60-odd species of mammals that can glide. One Sunda colugo (<em>Galeopterus variegatus</em>) was <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2690">recorded gliding 145 meters</a>, almost the length of three Olympic swimming pools.</p>



<p>That sustained glide was reported in 2011 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology </em>by Gregory Byrnes, a biologist at Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., and colleagues. At the time, most researchers assumed gliding was an energy-efficient way for colugos to travel. Byrnes’ team tested that idea by gluing data loggers onto wild Sunda colugos in Singapore and recording almost 260 glides among four individuals.</p>

<h3>Going the distance</h3>



<p>Among the 60-plus species of mammals that glide, including several gliders and flying squirrels, Sunda colugos have been recorded gliding as far as 145 meters.</p>

<p>Sunda colugos often climb before gliding. In the study, a Sunda colugo could climb a total of 320 meters and glide 1,342 meters in one night. “No one ever took into consideration that in order to glide, you’ve got to climb,” Byrnes says. His team fed colugo data into metabolic models of other tree-dwelling mammals to estimate how much energy colugos expend to both glide and climb. When climbing is included as part of gliding behavior, and in forests where treetops overlap, a colugo could save energy crawling through the canopy rather than gliding, he says.</p>



<p>The “big advantage” of gliding is that it saves colugos time, Byrnes says. Gliding lets an animal cross open space in a few seconds so that it can spend more time feeding or traveling even farther, he says.</p>



<p>Colugos pull off those long-distance glides with their gliding skin, known as a patagium. While other gliders like flying squirrels have a patagium that stretches to the hind feet, a colugo’s patagium continues all the way to the tip of the tail. A more expansive patagium gives a colugo extra “wing area,” which lifts and slows the animal, allowing a gentler descent than other gliders, Byrnes says. The extra skin also helps the animal glide far.</p>



<p>And there is more to the patagium than skin and fur. Byrnes and his collaborators have found that the thin patagium is rich in muscles, and some parts are stiffer than others. A colugo may be able to flex those muscles to change the shape and stiffness of its patagium and thereby adjust its aerodynamics midair. Understanding the gliding biomechanics of colugos might help in the design of robotics and wing technology, Byrnes says.</p>



<p>That evening in Langkawi, Batwoman glided down the road, across the road and up the road. Never a sound. Once, she was gliding straight toward a tree, and just before impact, she turned, cut a sharp arc and landed on the next trunk. Wow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Writer Yao-Hua Law tagged along with zoologist Priscillia Miard and colleagues to follow colugos on Langkawi island, Malaysia, as they glided from tree to tree along a busy village road.</figure>



<h4>High talk</h4>



<p>When Batwoman reached her fifth tree of the night, another colugo swooped in from the dark and hopped up the trunk toward her.</p>



<p>Colugos were once thought to be solitary animals, Miard says. Social interactions were brief and rarely seen. But newer observations by Miard and others suggest that colugos form loose social groups of females or a mother and her offspring — even those that are weaned. Miard has seen up to six colugos in a tree. Males, though, seem to travel alone, joining groups of females only temporarily.</p>



<p>Miard trained her camera on the newcomer, which passed by Batwoman and continued into the canopy. Not a glance. Miard looked disappointed. “Oh no, he didn’t even say hi.”</p>



<p>To my ear, Batwoman hasn’t made a sound. But she may have been calling in ultrasound, inaudible to humans. Miard and colleagues <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2018.1463294">discovered ultrasound calls from colugos</a>, reporting the finding in 2019 in <em>Bioacoustics</em>. A microphone picked up the ultrasound signals during a bat survey, and Miard tracked the source to colugos. Many nocturnal animals, including bats, tarsiers and slow lorises, communicate in ultrasound, probably to avoid detection by predators. Colugos likely do the same. In November, Miard and colleagues will play the ultrasound calls in the field and listen for colugo responses.</p>



<p>It’s 8:15 p.m., dinnertime. Batwoman crawled into the thick foliage and gingerly pulled some leaves for a sniff. Miard explained that colugos eat mostly leaves. Batwoman shoved some leaves into her mouth and began to chew. Fizri and Lacomme recorded the observations on a behavior checklist on their smartphones.</p>



<p>“Wait, the baby is trying to eat leaves,” said Miard, looking through the binoculars. Lacomme shined her red-light head lamp at Batwoman. The baby colugo reached out from under its mother, tugged a few small leaves and tried to nibble them. Maybe the baby is learning what to eat from its mother, Miard said. It was too dim for me to tell if the baby actually ate the leaves. Lacomme’s red-light head lamp wasn’t bright enough. White light might have offered a better view.</p>



<p>But Miard won’t shine white light on nocturnal mammals. “When we use white light on colugos, they freeze, but not when we use red light,” she told me later. The freezing, she says, is a sign that white light disturbs the nocturnal mammals.</p>



<p>Miard’s concern makes sense. White light, which is commonly used in nocturnal animal studies, can quickly saturate the sensitive optic cells in nocturnal animals’ eyes and cause temporary blindness, says primatologist Amanda Melin of the University of Calgary in Canada. “These moments of blindness are likely disorienting and potentially harmful,” Melin says. “Red light is likely far less disruptive as it will be much lower intensity” than white light.</p>

<h4>Eager pursuit</h4>



<p>Around 9 p.m., another colugo glided in and joined Batwoman on a tree. This one seemed more interested than the last; he poked Batwoman and bit her sides. The newcomer, a male, wanted to mate, Miard said. But every time he got close, Batwoman pulled away.</p>



<p>Miard clutched her camera tight. Colugo romance makes prized footage. Gazing into the canopy, Miard backed away from the tree and onto the road — into the path of an oncoming car that just managed to stop before hitting her.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img alt="Priscilla Miard looking up into a tree" class="wp-image-3093672" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/112120_yl_colugos_inline5_680-337x450.jpg" width="337" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093672">On an early evening in Malaysia in June, zoologist Priscillia Miard uses a thermal-imaging device to search for colugos, which have coats that camouflage them well against lichen-covered tree bark.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093672">Y.-H. Law</span></figure></div>



<p>“F—, we are going to miss the most important part. We know they are going to make babies, but I can’t see them,” Miard said. She turned to Fizri: “Where’s the thermal camera?”</p>



<p>Minutes later, Miard spotted the colugos near the top of the tree. “You are really lucky,” she told me. “Many exciting things tonight.”</p>



<p>Batwoman continued to test the male, which I decided to name “Eager.” She glided to another tree, then another and yet another with Eager close behind. The colugos lingered on one tree. Miard sat by the road, camera in hand, eyes on Batwoman.</p>



<p>“Come on guys…. Please let him do it, please … Batwoman,” Miard muttered.</p>



<p>Our small group piqued the curiosity of locals. A couple, standing at the porch of a nearby house, watched us for about 10 minutes, then came over. “It’s a <em>kubong</em>,” Fizri told them, giving the local Malay name for colugo.</p>



<p>The couple knew the name but not the animal. They thought colugos lived only in forests. “Does it eat fruit? Is it like a bat?” they asked in hushed tones. Fizri lowered his smartphone and began to explain colugo ecology. The opportunity to talk colugo with local residents and correct misconceptions is one of the reasons Miard likes to study colugos in villages.</p>



<h4>Colugo conservation</h4>



<p>Perhaps because they are nocturnal and well camouflaged, colugos live hidden in plain sight. Zoologist Dzulhelmi Nasir, now with the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, has studied colugos in Borneo. Most locals have never heard of colugos, he says. People often confuse the animals with flying squirrels or a giant fruit bat called <em>kluang </em>in Malay.</p>



<p>Confusion or misconceptions about the colugos can be deadly for the animals. In parts of Malaysia, orchard and plantation owners see colugos as fruit pests and kill them, Miard told me. But <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-004-6900-1">colugos rarely eat fruits and flowers</a>, according to a study published in 2006 in<em> Biodiversity &amp; Conservation</em>, as well as Miard’s own unpublished research. Fortunately, here in Langkawi, there are few commercial orchards, and locals leave colugos alone.</p>



<p>But across Southeast Asia, colugos are losing their forest homes to agriculture and development. The region <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0166-9">lost 293,000 square kilometers of forest</a> from 2000 to 2014, an area about the size of Arizona, according to a 2018 report in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>On the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, the Sunda colugo and the Philippine colugo (<em>Cynocephalus volans</em>) are <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41502/10479343">categorized</a> as “least concern” for risk of extinction. The Sunda colugo, in particular, with its wide distribution from Vietnam to Indonesia, is unlikely to be threatened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="An upside-down colugo looking directly at the camera" class="wp-image-3093673" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/112120_yl_colugos_inline6_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093673">Colugos live their whole lives in trees. The gliders visit several trees in a night, eating mostly leaves rather than fruit.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093673">Night Spotting Project</span></figure>



<p>But that assessment might be too rosy. Those two species may actually be eight, or as many as 14, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1600633">based on genetic evidence</a> reported in 2016 in <em>Science Advances</em>. If so, instead of the Sunda colugo being one widely distributed species, there are several colugo species confined to smaller areas that may be more susceptible to local extinction.</p>



<p>Zoologists had always noted that colugos look different across Southeast Asia. By the 1950s, about 20 species and subspecies were recognized based on physical differences. But zoologists decided to simplify things and lump all subspecies into two species, says geneticist Victor Mason, an author of the 2016 report, who studied colugo phylogeny at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station.</p>



<p>Mason and colleagues looked for signs of species diversity hidden in the genetic makeup of colugos, a task that required samples of colugo DNA from across Southeast Asia. The researchers turned to museum specimens in Singapore and the United States. “There’s hundreds of colugo skulls just sitting in drawers in tiny boxes collecting dust” amassed more than a century ago by European explorers, says Mason, now at the University of Bern’s Institute of Cell Biology in Switzerland.</p>



<p>Using DNA from the museum specimens, Mason and colleagues found up to 14 colugo groups with significant genetic differences. More work is needed to weigh these differences and review the diversity of colugo species. And more surveys of colugo populations and their whereabouts are needed, Miard says, to reliably tell if and where colugos are threatened.</p>



<p>The good news is that colugos appear to adapt well to forested human environments, including the villages in Langkawi. The animals feed on the leaves of five to seven different trees nightly, Dzulhelmi says based on his studies in Langkawi and Borneo. He says that if a township could plant enough trees in gardens, parks and zoos to support free-living colugos, locals could see and learn about the animals and appreciate them.</p>



<p>After 50 minutes of courtship, Eager the male colugo has given up. Batwoman glided back up the road — with four humans on her tail — and began feeding again. We spotted a few more colugos that night, but we stayed close to Batwoman.</p>



<p>Around 11 p.m., Batwoman was still plucking leaves. Suddenly, I felt the air brush my hair — a colugo glided past me to land on a tree about three meters away. I moved in for a closer look at the only colugo I spotted before my guides. But it began to rain, and we ran for shelter.</p>



<p>The next morning, we moved our survey to a leafy resort on the island. In two hours, we found 17 colugos, all hugging trees, motionless in the daylight. I spotted two before Miard did and tried to hide my glee. But the thrill was not mine alone. Soon after we found the 11th colugo, Miard couldn’t hold it in any longer: “I love colugos!”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-observatory-icon-puerto-rico-science-demolished">Arecibo Observatory, an ‘icon of Puerto Rican science,’ will be demolished</a></h4>

<p>Arecibo’s days are done. After two support cables failed in recent months, the radio observatory’s 305-meter-wide dish is damaged beyond repair, the National Science Foundation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=301674">announced on November 19</a>. It will be decommissioned and dismantled.</p>



<p>“It’s a death in the family,” says astronomer Martha Haynes of Cornell University, who has used the telescope in Puerto Rico to study hydrogen in the universe since she was fresh out of college in 1973. “For those of us who use Arecibo and had hoped to use it in the future, it’s a disaster.”</p>



<p>The telescope, famous for appearances in movies like <em>GoldenEye</em> and <em>Contact, </em>consists of a wide dish to collect radio waves from space and focus them into detectors housed in a dome suspended above the dish. In August, one of the cables that holds up the dome slipped out of a socket and punched a hole in the dish.</p>



<p>The NSF and the University of Central Florida, which manages the telescope, had plans to repair the cable, Haynes said. But then a second cable unexpectedly broke on November 6. If a third cable were to break, it could send the platform holding up the dome swinging, or the whole structure could collapse.</p>





<p>The NSF determined that there was no safe way to repair the telescope, the agency announced on November 19.</p>



<p>“Until these assessments came in, our question was not if the observatory should be repaired but how,” said Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences, in a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=301674">statement</a>. “But in the end, a preponderance of data showed that we simply could not do this safely. And that is a line we cannot cross.”</p>



<p>The closure is the last in a series of near disasters for Arecibo. A different cable was damaged in an earthquake in 2014. Repairs on that cable were delayed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/new-questions-about-arecibos-future-swirl-wake-hurricane-maria">Hurricane Maria in 2017</a>, which temporarily shut down the observatory as Puerto Rico weathered widespread power outages and humanitarian crises (<em>SN: 9/29/17</em>). And the observatory has been the victim of threatened or actual <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/arecibo-radio-telescope-nsf">budget cuts</a> for years (<em>SN: 11/17/17</em>).</p>



<p>But its loss is a major blow for astronomy. Built in 1963, Arecibo was one of the best facilities in the world for observations ranging from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fast-radio-burst-steady-beat">mysterious blasts of radio waves from deep space</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>) to tracking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">near-Earth asteroids</a> that could potentially crash into our planet (<em>SN: 1/20/20</em>). It also was used in the early days of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/interview-alien-hunter-jill-tarter">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>, or SETI (<em>SN: 5/29/12</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico" class="wp-image-3093738" height="329" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111920_LG_arecibo_inline-680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093738">The Arecibo Observatory starred in major films, scanned the sky for hazardous asteroids and spotted mysterious radio bursts from space, among other things.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093738">University of Central Florida</span></figure>



<p>“Astronomers don’t have a lot of facilities,” Haynes says. Each new one is designed to have unique advantages over existing telescopes. “So when you lose one, it’s gone.”</p>



<p>The observatory’s end is also a symbolic and practical loss for Puerto Rico, says radio astronomy researcher Kevin Ortiz Ceballos, a senior at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who used the observatory to study the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/borisov-interstellar-visitor-makes-oumuamua-seem-even-odder">first known interstellar comet</a> and stars that host exoplanets (<em>SN: 10/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>“Arecibo is like an icon of Puerto Rican science,” he says. “This is absolutely devastating.”</p>



<p>Ortiz Ceballos grew up watching Puerto Rican cartoons in which the characters went to Arecibo to use the telescope. His parents drove him an hour and a half to visit the telescope. He credits it with sparking his interest in astronomy, and he had hoped to come back to Puerto Rico to work at Arecibo after completing his Ph.D.</p>



<p>“Puerto Rico has a huge mass emigration problem,” he says. “It’s a lot of people, and they’re all my age. It’s a huge brain drain. Being able to do what I love without having to leave, it was a huge dream for me.”</p>



<p>And not just him, he notes: Dozens of students at the university and the observatory, plus more than 200 Puerto Rican students who went through the observatory’s high school program, have a similar story.</p>



<p>“Losing this, especially after all that we’ve lost over the past half decade, makes me feel like we’re condemned to have our country just be ruins,” he says. “It becomes a signifier of a broader collapse. That’s just really tragic.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooled-water-phase-critical-point-liquid-fluid">Supercooled water has been caught morphing between two forms</a></h4>

<p>Supercooled water is two of a kind, a new study shows.</p>



<p>Scientists have long suspected that water at subfreezing temperatures comes in two distinct varieties: a high-density liquid that appears at very high pressures and a low-density liquid at lower pressures. Now, ultrafast measurements have caught <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb9385">water morphing from one type of liquid to the other</a>, confirming that hunch. The discovery, reported in the Nov. 20 <em>Science</em>, could help explain some of water’s quirks.</p>



<p>The experiment “adds more and more evidence to the idea that water really is two components … and that that is the reason that underlies why water is so weird,” says physicist Greg Kimmel of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>When free from impurities, water can remain liquid below its typical freezing point of zero degrees Celsius, forming what’s called a supercooled liquid. But the dual nature of supercooled water was expected to appear in a temperature realm so difficult to study that it’s been dubbed “no-man’s-land.” Below around –40° C, water remains liquid for mere instants before it crystallizes into ice. Making the task even more daunting, the high-density phase appears only at very high pressures. Still, “people have dreamt about how to do an experiment,” says Anders Nilsson of Stockholm University.</p>





<p>Thanks to speedy experimental maneuvers, Nilsson and colleagues have infiltrated that no-man’s-land by monitoring water’s properties on a scale of nanoseconds. “This is one of the major accomplishments of this paper,” says computational chemist Gül Zerze of Princeton University. “I’m impressed with their work.”</p>



<p>The scientists started by creating a type of high-density ice. Then, a pulse from an infrared laser heated the ice, forming liquid water under high pressure. That water then expanded, and the pressure rapidly dropped. Meanwhile, the researchers used an X-ray laser to investigate how the structure of the water changed, based on how the X-rays scattered. As the pressure decreased, the water transitioned from a high-density to low-density fluid before crystallizing into ice.</p>



<p>Previous studies have used ultrafast techniques to find hints of water’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-motion-experiment-reveals-supercooled-water-dual-nature">two-faced demeanor</a>, but those have been done mainly at atmospheric pressure (<em>SN: 9/28/20</em>). In the new work, the water was observed at about 3,000 times atmospheric pressure and –68° C. “It’s the first time we have real experimental data at these pressures and temperatures,” says physicist Loni Kringle of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who was not involved with the experiment.</p>



<p>The result could indicate that supercooled water has a “critical point” — a certain pressure and temperature at which two distinct phases merge into one. In the future, Nilsson hopes to pinpoint that spot.</p>



<p>Such a critical point could explain why water is an oddball liquid. For most liquids, cooling makes them become denser and more difficult to compress. Water gets denser as it is cooled to 4° C, but becomes less dense as it is cooled further. Likewise, its compressibility increases as it’s cooled.</p>



<p>If supercooled water has a critical point, that could indicate that the water experienced in daily life is strange because, under typical pressures and temperatures, it is a supercritical liquid — a weird state that occurs beyond a critical point. Such a liquid would not be the high-density or low-density form, but would consist of some regions with a high-density arrangement of water molecules and other pockets of low density. The relative amounts of those two structures, which result from different arrangements of hydrogen bonds between the molecules, would change as the temperature changes, explaining why water behaves strangely as it is cooled.</p>



<p>So despite the fact that the experiment involved extreme pressures and temperatures, Nilsson says, “it influences water in our ordinary life.”</p>

<p><strong><strong>Effects of Earth’s magnetic field</strong></strong> <em>— </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/earth-sciences-3"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em> November 21, 1970</p>



<p>Earth’s magnetic field has frequently reversed at intervals of 1 million to 100 million years. A few scientists now suspect that these reversals may have had drastic effects on terrestrial life.… During the past 2.5 million years, eight species of one-cell marine animals called Radiolaria became extinct. Six of these extinctions occurred simultaneously throughout their geographic range immediately following magnetic reversals.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Earth’s magnetic field protects the planet from cosmic and solar radiation, but that field can weaken during pole reversals. Such reversals might harm more than select species, perhaps playing a role in some mass extinctions. Direct evidence has eluded researchers, but there are suggestive examples. In 2016, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X16000319">linked a mass extinction of marine life 550 million years ago</a> with reversals that weakened the magnetic field. The resulting increased radiation could have led to the demise of many shallow-water organisms, the team speculated.</p>

<p>When food and space get scarce, competition can bring out the worst in monarch caterpillars.</p>



<p>In the laboratory, researchers watched as roaming caterpillars looking for a hard-to-find meal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101791">started head-butting and lunging at fellow caterpillars munching on a milkweed leaf</a>. That aggressive behavior is apparently meant to disrupt the feeding insects and help the instigators score dinner, biologist and neuroscientist Alex Keene and colleagues report online November 19 in <em>iScience.</em></p>



<p>Keene usually studies fruit flies and cavefish, but he decided to adapt his laboratory to study monarchs after a chance observation. “My wife pointed out in the backyard that these two monarch caterpillars were fighting with each other,” says Keene, of Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter. “I went on YouTube, and there were videos of this behavior,” he says, but for monarchs, “it wasn’t documented anywhere in the scientific literature.” Other types of caterpillars have shown <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10905-015-9511-7">similar aggressive behavior</a> in other settings.</p>



<p>Going from a self-proclaimed “simple fly biologist” to monarch researcher, however, was a challenge. Not only did Hurricane Dorian in 2019 blow over the plants in the lab’s monarch garden, but also finding pesticide-free milkweed plants that the caterpillars would eat was harder than expected. Once the researchers overcame these challenges, though, they were able to film caterpillars competing with one another when the researchers limited the amount of available food.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>In a laboratory, researchers watched monarch caterpillars snap at and head-butt each other over access to a milkweed leaf, their only food source in the wild.</figure>



<p> “With decreasing food availability, we find increased levels of aggression,” as well as a “loser response,” with the caterpillar that gets attacked often leaving the area, says Elizabeth Brown, a biologist who works in Keene’s lab.</p>





<p>This kind of behavior does occur outside the lab, says Jaap de Roode, a biologist at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the research. Competition can be tough, he adds, because monarch caterpillars are limited in their food options. The insects <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bloodflower-milkweed-monarch-butterflies-climate-changes">eat only milkweed</a>, and are more or less stuck on the plant that they’re born on until they bulk up, because crawling from plant to plant takes energy (<em>SN: 7/10/18</em>). If there isn’t enough food from the one plant to feed several caterpillars, “they won’t make it,” he says.</p>





<p>Making things more difficult, the caterpillars need a huge amount of food to transform into a butterfly. “From egg to chrysalis, they multiply their weight 3,000 times, and they do that in about two weeks,” de Roode says. That’s like a person gaining the weight of two blue whales in two weeks.</p>



<p>“Monarchs are like eating machines,” Keene says. But “some were much more aggressive than others.” So the next step could be exploring whether or not the more aggressive caterpillars grow into aggressive butterflies, he says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Type the word “hacker” into any stock photo search engine and you’ll be greeted with <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search/hacker?image_type=photo">pages</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/images/search/hacker/">pages</a> of images of someone sitting in the dark, typing threateningly at their laptop, and more often than not wearing a balaclava or Guy Fawkes mask. That <em>Matrix</em>-inspired 1990s aesthetic of green code on black is still prevalent — and still implies that hackers have inherently nefarious ends.</p>



<p>More recently, however, the idea of hacking as a prosocial activity has gained more attention. Earlier this year, one group of hackers made headlines for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54591761">donating</a> $10,000 in Bitcoin to two charities, the result of what they say was the extortion of millions of dollars from multinational companies.</p>



<p>While the charities declined the donations, social media responses were more mixed, with some praising the hackers. And in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430220937777">new study</a>, Maria S. Heering and colleagues from the University of Kent argue that our view of hacking <em>is</em> somewhat malleable: when people were treated unfairly and the institutions responsible did nothing to redress their grievances, they felt more positive about hackers who targeted the source of their anger.</p>



<span id="more-40879"></span>



<p>In the first study, 259 participants were asked to imagine themselves taking an exam which was crucial to their future career prospects. The questions in the exam, they were told, were vague and unrelated to the content they’d been taught — and when looking at the transcript after the exam, they found they had been marked unfairly. Participants were then asked to imagine taking their grievance to the university with several classmates.</p>



<p>Following this introductory scenario, participants were split into two groups and given different information about how responsive the university was (these kinds of beliefs about the responsiveness of an institution are known as “external efficacy”). Half of the participants read that the university system was unresponsive to their requests (low external efficacy); the others read that the university <em>was</em> willing to address their complaints (high external efficacy).</p>



<p>Participants then completed measures related to their anger against the system (e.g. “I am furious about the way in which the exam office handled my complaint”) before reading that the university had been targeted by hackers, who left the message “learn to do your job” on the institution’s homepage.</p>



<p>Finally, participants indicated how much they agreed with statements related to the hackers’ legitimacy, whether or not the hackers deserve respect and admiration, and how positive or negative they felt the hackers’ actions were for both the university and democracy more generally.</p>



<p>As expected, participants who read that the university had been unresponsive to their unfair treatment felt more anger towards the system; in turn, this anger led to stronger feelings that hackers’ actions were legitimate.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first, only this time participants were told that a researcher had rejected the work they had submitted on an academic survey platform. In the low external efficacy condition, the site did not help participants who felt their work had been unfairly rejected, and in the high external efficacy condition participants received support and were told a new system would be put in place to query rejected work. All participants again read that hackers had targeted the platform and left the same “learn to do your job” message.</p>



<p>As in the first study, participants felt more anger against the platform in the low external efficacy condition — and again, this anger positively predicted how legitimate they perceived the hacking to be.</p>



<p>On a small scale, it may seem obvious that if someone attacks a system or institution you feel has wronged you, you’re likely to be supportive of them. But the results also prompt interesting questions about wider society. The team notes that the key factor determining legitimisation of hackers is an unmet demand for fairer social arrangements — an issue that comes to the fore time and time again on both big and small scales. During lockdown, for example, much attention has been paid to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/american-billionaires-got-434-billion-richer-during-the-pandemic.html">increase in wealth</a> of a few very rich individuals whilst others around the world struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>In cases of wider societal unfairness, therefore, our views of those who disrupt that uneven power imbalance may become more and positive. In an age where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism">trust appears to have been eroded</a> precisely because people feel their demands are not being met, it’s worth exploring these issues in more detail.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/guttural-toads-shrink-island-dwarfism-evolution">Guttural toads shrank by a third after just 100 years on two islands</a></h4>

<p>On two islands in the Indian Ocean, the toads just aren’t what they used to be. Less than a century after their introduction by humans, the islands’ toads have shrunk in size by about a third. </p>



<p>The finding, reported online November 18 in <em>Biology Letters</em>, potentially illustrates that “island dwarfism,” where animals evolve to be much smaller after settling on an island, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0651">can occur over very short timescales</a>. </p>



<p>“When you imagine insular dwarfism, you imagine this happening over thousands or millions of years,” says James Baxter-Gilbert, an invasion biologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. “But this [research] has the potential to show it happening in four orders of magnitude shorter timeframe, which is super exciting.”</p>



<p>Guttural toads (<em>Sclerophrys gutturalis</em>) are native to much of the eastern half of sub-Saharan Africa. Humans brought the toads to Mauritius — an island east of Madagascar, roughly 2,000 kilometers from mainland Africa — in 1922 to devour cane beetles. Just five years later, toads from Mauritius were brought to the nearby island of Réunion to control mosquito populations. </p>





<p>Baxter-Gilbert was fascinated by how those deliberate introductions might have influenced the toads’ evolution and biology. Thanks to previous work on the toads’ genetics, it was clear that the island toads’ likely progenitors were from Durban, South Africa.</p>



<p>“We know the [genetic] blueprint that they came with,” he says. “We can kind of see how they have changed from that original blueprint.”</p>



<p>From June 2019 to March 2020, Baxter-Gilbert and colleagues caught nearly 500 toads from Mauritius, Réunion and Durban. The team noted the sex of each toad and measured body length plus different dimensions of the jaw, legs and feet. </p>



<p>Island toads were quite a bit smaller than the roughly 7-centimeter-long toads in Durban. Female toads measured on average about 34 percent shorter on Mauritius and 26 percent shorter on Réunion. Male Mauritius toads were about 22 percent shorter, while male Réunion toads were about the same size as their mainland counterparts. Both sexes of island toads had legs and feet that not only were shorter than Durban toads’, but also disproportionately stumpy for their already reduced body size. </p>

Baxter-Gilbert; John Measey</span></figure>



<p>Both the fossil record and recent natural history are full of examples of island dwarfs, ranging from Ice Age mammoths to hippos on the island of Crete to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dino-dwarf-island-living-may-have-led-ancient-downsizing">dinosaurs</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 11/10/04</em>)<em>.</em> Such shrinking may be the result of less available food on an island, making smaller bodies more advantageous. The reduction could also be an evolutionary response to a lack of predators.</p>



<p>“In the case of [dwarf] elephants, they have the luxury to evolve miniature size when no lions and tigers are on the hunt for their calves,” says Alexandra van der Geer, a paleontologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands, who was not involved with this research. “Why would this not apply to frogs?” she says. On the mainland, being larger may be more useful in dissuading the toads’ predators, she says. Those predators can include snakes and birds.</p>



<p>The new study’s findings provide a fresh look at some of the early stages of this downsizing and how quickly it occurs. Major body size changes to other island dwarfs might have also occurred soon after the animals arrived on islands, and just persisted over millennia, Baxter-Gilbert says. </p>



<p>The island toads’ short legs may have arisen because there’s little pressure on tiny islands to move into new territory quickly to beat competing toads to an area of rich resources, unlike what cane toads invading Australia are experiencing. Those dinner plate–sized <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/quick-moving-toads-take-straight-and-narrow-path">toads</a> are evolving into forms that can travel efficiently over long distances across Australia’s giant landmass (<em>SN</em>: <em>10/14/14</em>). </p>



<p>“If you’re a toad on an island and there’s nowhere to disperse to, then you don’t need to invest energy into getting these long gangly legs that let you jump straight for days on end, because there’s nowhere to go,” Baxter-Gilbert says. </p>



<p>Baxter-Gilbert acknowledges that the shrinking may not be due to natural selection and could instead be a consequence of the toads having the developmental flexibility to respond to a quirk of their island environment. Another possibility is the toads are smaller due to a dietary deficiency, or maybe the climate isn’t quite right for the toads to reach full size. </p>



<p>He wants to raise some island toads on the African mainland with their Durban counterparts in a “common garden” experiment. This could help determine if diet, temperature or some other environmental condition on the two islands, rather than rapid evolution, could be behind the toads’ diminutive size.</p>

<p>Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate may be more effective than early results suggested.</p>



<p>Just a week after releasing interim results suggesting the vaccine was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data">more than 90 percent effective</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/20</em>), the pharmaceutical giant and its German biotech partner BioNTech announced final results of their 41,000-person clinical trial. A final analysis indicates that the vaccine is <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">safe and 95 percent effective</a> at preventing illness, the companies announced November 18. The results, shared in a news release, have yet to be peer reviewed by other scientists.</p>



<p>Final results depended on getting a certain number of infections in the study group. Normally it might take months to tally the cases needed to make a final efficacy determination, but infection rates in the United States have been so high that coronavirus cases quickly racked up in the trial, speeding up the timeline for analyzing the final results. </p>



<p>Among 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19, 162 had gotten a placebo. Just eight cases were recorded in the group that received the vaccine. </p>





<p>Efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results">comparable to preliminary results from Moderna’s vaccine</a> trial, announced November 16 (<em>SN: 11/16/20</em>). Both vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to carry instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein to human cells. Human cells read those instructions and produce the viral protein, priming the immune system to ward off the virus should it be encountered later.</p>

<p>The vaccine, which requires two shots spaced a month apart, may also lessen severity of the disease. During the trial 10 people became severely ill. Nine of those people were in the placebo group, while one severely ill person was in the vaccine group. Among people 65 and older, the vaccine was more than 94 percent effective, the companies said. That’s particularly good news because vaccines often are not as effective in older people, because immune systems tend to weaken with age.</p>



<p>Pfizer and BioNTech plan to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization within days, and say 50 million doses of the vaccine — enough to immunize roughly 25 million people — will be available by the end of the year. </p>



<p>The news comes as COVID-19 cases continue to skyrocket. As of November 18, nearly 58 million people globally have been infected and 1.3 million people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracker. The United States leads the world in cases, with 11.4 million infections and nearly 249,000 deaths. More than 100,000 new cases and about 1,500 deaths are being recorded nationwide every day, and many states are tightening or implementing new public health measures to counter the virus’s spread.</p>

<p>Video games get blamed for a lot. There are long-standing debates about whether violence in video games leads to real-world aggression, or whether video game “addiction” is something we should worry about. And some people have broader fears that more time spent on screens negatively affects our mental health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>However, an <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/video-game-addiction-facts-statistics">number</a> of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">studies</a> have failed to find much evidence to back up these kinds of concerns. But the field suffers from some pretty big limitations. In particular, studies often rely on people reporting their own time spent consuming media — and we’re notoriously unreliable at making those sorts of estimates.</p>



<p>Enter a new study from Niklas Johannes and colleagues at the Oxford Internet Institute, published as a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza/">preprint on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a><em> </em>earlier this week. The researchers find that more time spent playing video games actually relates to <em>greater</em> wellbeing (though there are plenty of caveats to that finding — more on those later). But the most interesting part of the study is really its methodology: rather than relying on people reporting their own video game use, the researchers established a rare collaboration with games companies in order to get precise data.</p>



<span id="more-40867"></span>



<p>Two companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo, provided the team with data from players of <em>Plants vs Zombies:</em> <em>Battle for Neighborville </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>respectively. The companies sent out surveys to hundreds of thousands of adult players; these included a wellbeing measure, in which participants rated how often they’d experienced six positive and six negative feelings in the past two weeks. Crucially, the companies also provided data on the number and length of the players’ gaming sessions during those two weeks. </p>



<p>Only a fraction of people responded, ultimately leaving the team with data from 471 <em>Plants vs Zombies</em> players and 2,756 <em>Animal Crossing </em>players. And they found that, overall, the more time people spent playing over that two week period, the greater their wellbeing tended to be. It’s worth noting that although significant, this effect was small: even a large increase in time spent playing was related to a very modest increase in wellbeing. Importantly, the data also showed that people weren’t great at estimating how long they had spent playing over the two week period — their estimates were off by about two hours, highlighting the problems of relying just on self-report data.</p>



<p>The results, then, cast further doubt on the idea that spending more time playing video games is detrimental to our mental health. In fact, the study suggests that there is some kind of link between playing video games for longer and <em>greater</em> wellbeing. This is clearly noteworthy, as so much of the discussion around video games (and screen time generally) just assumes that limiting the time spent playing is a good thing, without acknowledging that it could potentially have detrimental effects.</p>



<p>But, inevitably, over the past few days we’ve seen a lot of headlines proclaiming that video games are “good for wellbeing” or “benefit mental health”. That may well be true. But it’s not really possible to make those kinds of claims from the study’s correlational data. Perhaps people who are happier play video games for longer. Or maybe it’s something else entirely that both leads people to play video games for longer and boosts wellbeing (having the luxury of free time, for example). And even if there <em>is</em> a causal link, it’s not clear that it would be a meaningful one, given that the size of the effect was so small.</p>



<p>There are other limitations too. The data comes from the small group of people who chose to complete the survey, all of whom were over 18. So the study can’t necessarily say much about potential effects among the broader population, particularly young people. And it remains to be seen whether time spent playing other kinds of games relates to similar changes in wellbeing.</p>



<p>It’s important to point out that the authors do go to lengths to explain these limitations in the paper. But it feels like the nuances have been brushed over in much of the media coverage.</p>



<p>Still, none of this should detract from the most interesting and exciting part of the study: the fact that the researchers have collaborated with industry and obtained real data on people’s playing habits. The lack of access to data from media companies has long been a major obstacle to this kind of work, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">Amy Orben told us earlier this year</a>. Perhaps this study will pave the way for further collaboration. Indeed, the researchers call on companies to share data from other games and audiences, and across longer time-scales. Hopefully this kind of data will help to answer some of the intriguing questions that the study poses.   </p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neural probes with large number of close packed recording sites each comprising
of 32 electrodes are being developed for large scale neuronal recordings from
multiple brain areas simultaneously to understand complex brain activity in vivo.
By precisely mapping the position of each site inside rat brain, they help us to
characterize neural activity on the basis of cortical depth from where it is
obtained. Their application lies in neurosurgery, where it is important to locate
the target of surgical interest inside the brain in real time. In this work, we
have first compared various methods from literature to analyze extracellular
activity recorded using CMOS neural probes from different cortical depths and
from different locations along same lateral axis of rat brain to find a criterion
on the basis of which recordings can be classified. After finding out the most
promising criterion, we have tried to implement it on neuromorphic hardware
SpiNNaker. We tested single neuron and spiking excitatory-inhibitory network
for implementation and found that excitatory-inhibitory network is more robust to
noise present in signal and its output can be improved by introducing lateral
inhibition. Our results show that SpiNNaker can be used for rough indication of
cortical depth.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/democracy-5278455_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Against a backdrop of the vote to leave the European Union, hostility towards migrants, and the growth in right-wing nationalist movements, racial discrimination is sadly on the rise in the UK. There is evidence that experiencing racial discrimination can negatively impact health. However, the majority of studies to date have been carried out in the US. The makeup of ethnic minority groups in the UK differs to that in the US, with those of South Asian backgrounds forming the largest minority group. Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which racial discrimination impacts health in the UK-context.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09792-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our study</a> looked at over 4800 people who took part in the UK Household Longitudinal Study over a period of two years. One in five participants from an ethnic minority group reported racial discrimination (which included feeling unsafe, avoiding certain places, being insulted and being physically attacked). We found that these individuals were more likely to develop poorer mental and physical health after these experiences. Specifically, we found that perceived racial discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress and poorer mental functioning two-years later. Moreover, people who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up, regardless of their health at the time of the discriminatory experience.</p>
<p>The study builds upon previous research which has mostly measured racial discrimination and health at the same time, meaning that establishing the direction of the relationship is difficult. Here we show that the experience of racial discrimination precedes the development of poorer health. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984732/">One previous study</a> linked racial discrimination with a deterioration in mental health in a UK sample. Our findings build upon this evidence and show that the negative effects of racial discrimination extend to physical health also.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors</p></blockquote>
<p>But how can experiencing racial discrimination lead to serious health outcomes? At the individual level, our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors (e.g. excessive alcohol intake) that can lead to poor health. Feeling discriminated against might also mean that people avoid engaging with health or well-being services perceived to be discriminatory. At the broader structural level, racial discrimination might negatively impact health through inequalities in healthcare and the unfair distribution of social determinants of health such as education, employment, and housing.</p>
<p>The issue of racial discrimination is one that has garnered increasing attention, particularly this year in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests. The results of our study are concerning suggesting an enduring impact of experiences of racism on mental and physical health. They highlight the need to tackle racial discrimination – not only as a human rights issue, but as an issue that may also have a lasting legacy on health. We need to educate, raise awareness, and promote activism to bring about legislative and social change required to eliminate racial discrimination both in the UK and worldwide. We also need to target the structural macro-level forces that shape the position of ethnic minorities in society. More research is needed to understand the pathways linking racial discrimination and health in order to develop interventions and policy that can be used to tackle socio-political processes that promote racial discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recently published</a> pilot study on the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol) in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, concluded that the treatment “seems able to reduce the severity of disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required go show a definitive answer”. In a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow-up</a> paper, Jungreis and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kellis</a> re-examine this so-called “Córdoba study” and argue that the authors of the study have undersold their results. Based on a reanalysis of the data in a manner they describe as “rigorous” and using “well established statistical techniques”, they urge the medical community to “consider testing the vitamin D levels of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and taking remedial action for those who are deficient.” Their recommendation is based on two claims: in an examination of unevenness in the distribution of one of the comorbidities between cases and controls, they conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”, and they present a “mathematical theorem” to make the case that the effect size in the Córdoba study is significant to the extent that “they can be confident that if assignment to the treatment group had no effect, we would not have observed these results simply due to chance.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the “mathematical analysis” of Jungreis and Kellis is deeply flawed, and their “theorem” is vacuous. Their analysis cannot be used to conclude that the Córdoba study shows that calcifediol significantly reduces ICU admission of hospitalized COVID- 19 patients. Moreover, the Córdoba study is fundamentally flawed, and therefore there is nothing to learn from it.</p>



<p><strong>The Córdoba study</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study, described by the authors as a pilot, was ostensibly a randomized controlled trial, designed to determine the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study consisted of 76 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms, with 50 of the patients treated with calcifediol, and 26 not receiving treatment. Patients were administered “standard care”, which according to the authors consisted of “a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and for patients with pneumonia and NEWS score 5, a broad spectrum antibiotic”. Crucially, admission to the ICU was determined by a “Selection Committee” consisting of intensivists, pulmonologists, internists, and members of an ethics committee. The Selection Committee based ICU admission decisions on the evaluation of several criteria, including presence of comorbidities, and the level of dependence of patients according to their needs and clinical criteria.</p>



<p>The result of the Córdoba trial was that only 1/50 of the treated patients was admitted to the ICU, whereas 13/26 of the untreated patients were admitted (p-value = 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> by Fisher’s exact test). This is a minuscule p-value but it is meaningless. Since there is no record of the Selection Committee deliberations, it impossible to know whether the ICU admission of the 13 untreated patients was due to their previous high blood pressure comorbidity. Perhaps the 11 treated patients with the comorbidity were not admitted to the ICU because they were older, and the Selection Committee considered their previous higher blood pressure to be more “normal” (14/50 treatment patients were over the age of 60, versus only 5/26 of the untreated patients).</p>

<p>Figure 1: Table 2 from [1] showing the comorbidities of patients. It is reproduced by virtue of [1] being published open access under the CC-BY license.</p>



<p>The fact that admission to the ICU could be decided in part based on the presence of co-morbidities, and that there was a significant imbalance in one of the comorbidities, immediately renders the study results meaningless. There are several other problems with it that potentially confound the results: the study did not examine the Vitamin D levels of the treated patients, nor was the untreated group administered a placebo. Most importantly, the study numbers were tiny, with only 76 patients examined. Small studies are notoriously problematic, and are known to produce large effect sizes [9]. Furthermore, sloppiness in the study does not lead to confidence in the results. The authors state that the “rigorous protocol” for determining patient admission to the ICU is available as Supplementary Material, but there is no Supplementary Material distributed with the paper. There is also an embarrassing typo: Fisher’s exact test is referred to twice as “Fischer’s test”. To err once in describing this classical statistical test may be regarded as misfortune; to do it twice looks like carelessness.</p>



<p><strong>A pointless statistics exercise</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study has not received much attention, which is not surprising considering that by the authors’ own admission it was a pilot that at best only motivates a properly matched and powered randomized controlled trial. Indeed, the authors mention that such a trial (the COVIDIOL trial), with data being collected from 15 hospitals in Spain, is underway. Nevertheless, Jungreis and Kellis [3], apparently mesmerized by the 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> p-value for ICU admission upon treatment, felt the need to “rescue” the study with what amounts to faux statistical gravitas. They argue for immediate consideration of testing Vitamin D levels of hospitalized patients, so that “deficient” patients can be administered some form of Vitamin D “to the extent it can be done safely”. Their message has been noticed; only a few days after [3] appeared the authors’ tweet to promote it has been retweeted more than 50 times [8].</p>



<p>Jungreis and Kellis claim that the p-value for the effect of calcifediol on patients is so significant, that in and of itself it merits belief that administration of calcifediol does, in fact, prevent admission of patients to ICUs. To make their case, Jungreis and Kellis begin by acknowledging that imbalance between the treated and untreated groups in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity may be a problem, but claim that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization.” Their argument is as follows: they note that while the p-value for the imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.0023, it should be adjusted for the fact that there are 15 distinct comorbidities, and that just by chance, when computing so many p-values, one might be small. First, an examination of Table 2 in [1] (Figure 1) shows that there were only 14 comorbidities assessed, as none of the patients had previous chronic kidney disease. Thus, the number 15 is incorrect. Second, Jungreis and Kellis argue that a Bonferroni correction should be applied, and that this correction should be based on 30 tests (=15 × 2). The reason for the factor of 2 is that they claim that when testing for imbalance, one should test for imbalance in both directions. By applying the Bonferroni correction to the p-values, they derive a “corrected” p-value for previous high blood pressure being imbalanced between groups of 0.069. They are wrong on several counts in deriving this number. To illustrate the problems we work through the calculation step-by-step:</p>



<p>The question we want to answer is as follows: given that there are multiple comorbidities, is there is a significant imbalance in <em>at least</em> one comorbidity. There are several ways to test for this, with the simplest being Šidák’s correction [10] given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%5Cquad+%3D+%5Cquad+1-%281-m%29%5En%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," /></p>



<p>where <em>m</em> is the minimum p-value among the comorbidities, and <em>n</em> is the number of tests. Plugging in <em>m = 0.0023</em> (the smallest p-value in Table 2 of [1]) and <em>n = 14</em> (the number of comorbidities) one gets 0.032 (note that the Bonferroni correction used by Jungreis And Kellis is the Taylor approximation to the Šidák correction when <em>m</em> is small). The Šidák correction is based on an assumption that the tests are independent. However, that is certainly not the case in the Córdoba study. For example, having at least one prognostic factor is one of the comorbidities tabulated. In other words, the p-value obtained is conservative. The calculation above uses n = 14, but Jungreis and Kellis reason that the number of tests is 30 = 15 × 2, to take into account an imbalance in either the treated or untreated direction. Here they are assuming two things: that two-sided tests for each comorbidity will produce double the p-value of a one-sided test, and that two sided tests are the “correct” tests to perform. They are wrong on both counts. First, the two-sided Fisher exact test does not, in general produce a p-value that is double the 1-sided test. The study result is a good example: 1/49 treated patients admitted to the ICU vs. 13/26 untreated patients produces a p-value of 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> for both the 1-sided and 2-sided tests. Jungreis and Kellis do not seem to know this can happen, nor understand why; they go to great lengths to explain the importance of conducting a 1-sided test for the study result. Second, there is a strong case to be made that a 1-sided test is the correct test to perform for the comorbidities. The concern is not whether there was an imbalance of any sort, but whether the imbalance would skew results by virtue of the study including too many untreated individuals with comorbidities. In any case, if one were to give Jungreis and Kellis the benefit of the doubt, and perform a two sided test, the corrected p-value for the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.06 and not 0.069.</p>



<p>The most serious mistake that Jungreis and Kellis make, however, is in claiming that one can accept the null hypothesis of a hypothesis test when the p-value is greater than 0.05. The p-value they obtain is 0.069 which, even if it is taken at face value, is not grounds for claiming, as Jungreis and Kellis do, that “this is not significant evidence that the assignment was not random” and reason to conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”. That is not how p-values work. A p-value less than 0.05 allows one to reject the null hypothesis (assuming 0.05 is the threshold chosen), but a p-value above the chosen threshold is not grounds for accepting the null. Moreover, the corrected p-value is 0.032 which is certainly grounds for rejecting the null hypothesis that the randomization was random.</p>



<p>Correction of the incorrect Jungreis and Kellis statistics may be a productive exercise in introductory undergraduate statistics for some, but it is pointless insofar as assessing the Córdoba study. While the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is problematic because patients with the comorbidity may be more likely to get sick and require ICU admission, the study was so flawed that the exact p-value for the imbalance is a moot point. Given that the presence of comorbidities, not just their effect on patients, was a factor in determining which patients were admitted to the ICU, the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity renders the result of the study meaningless <em>ex facie</em>.</p>



<p><strong>A definition is not a theorem is not proof of efficacy</strong></p>



<p>In an effort to fend off criticism that the comorbidities of patients were improperly balanced in the study, Jungreis and Kellis go further and present a “theorem” they claim shows that there was a minuscule chance that an uneven distribution of comorbidities could render the study results not significant. The “theorem” is stated twice in their paper, and I’ve copied both theorem statements verbatim from their paper:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> <em>In a randomized study, let p be the p-value of the study results, and let q be the probability that the randomization assigns patients to the control group in such a way that the values of P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient) are sufficiently unevenly distributed between the treatment and control groups that the result of the study would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level after p controlling for the prognostic risk factors. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>According to Jungreis and Kellis, <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em> is the following: “There can be any number of prognostic risk factors, but if we knew what all of them were, and their effect sizes, and the interactions among them, we could combine their effects into a single number for each patient, which is the probability, based on all known and yet-to-be discovered risk factors at the time of hospital admission, that the patient will require ICU care if not given the calcifediol treatment. Call this (unknown) probability <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em>.”</p>



<p>The theorem is restated in the Methods section of Jungreis and Kellis paper as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> <em>In a randomized controlled study, let p be the p-value of the study outcome, and let q be the probability that the randomization distributes all prognostic risk factors combined sufficiently unevenly between the treatment and control groups that when controlling for these prognostic risk p factors the outcome would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>While it is difficult to decipher the language the “theorem” is written in, let alone its meaning (note Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are supposedly the same theorem), I was able to glean something about its content from reading the “proof”. The mathematical content of whatever the theorem is supposed to mean, is the definition of conditional probability, namely that if A and B are events with <img alt="P(B) &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%29+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(B) &gt; 0" />, then</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cquad+%3A%3D+%5Cquad+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A+%5Ccap+B%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}" />.</p>



<p>To be fair to Jungreis and Kellis, the “theorem” includes the observation that </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A+%5Ccap+B%29+%5Cleq+P%28A%29+%5Cquad+%5CRightarrow+%5Cquad+P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." /></p>



<p>This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a “theorem”; it is literally the definition of conditional probability followed by an elementary inequality. The most generous interpretation of what Jungreis and Kellis were trying to do with this “theorem”, is that they were showing that the p-value for the study is so small, that it is small even after being multiplied by 20. There are less generous interpretations.</p>



<p><strong>Does Vitamin D intake reduce ICU admission?</strong></p>



<p>There has been a lot of interest in Vitamin D and its effects on human health over the past decade [2], and much speculation about its relevance for COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. One interesting result on disease susceptibility was published recently: in a study of 489 patients, it was found that the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status [7]. However, definitive results on Vitamin D and its relationship to COVID- 19 will have to await larger trials. One such trial, a large randomized clinical trial with 2,700 individuals sponsored by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is currently underway [4]. While this study might shed some light on Vitamin D and COVID-19, it is prudent to keep in mind that the outcome is not certain. Vitamin D levels are confounded with many socioeconomic factors, making the identification of causal links difficult. In the meantime, it has been suggested that it makes sense for individuals to maintain reference nutrient intakes of Vitamin D [6]. Such a public health recommendation is not controversial.</p>



<p>As for Vitamin D administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients reducing ICU admission, the best one can say about the Córdoba study is that nothing can be learned from it. Unfortunately, the poor study design, small sample size, availability of only summary statistics for the comorbidities, and imbalanced comorbidities among treated and untreated patients render the data useless. While it may be true that calcifediol administration to hospital patients reduces subsequent ICU admission, it may also not be true. Thus, the follow-up by Jungreis and Kellis is pointless at best. At worst, it is irresponsible propaganda, advocating for potentially dangerous treatment on the basis of shoddy arguments masked as “rigorous and well established statistical techniques”. It is surprising to see Jungreis and Kellis argue that it may be unethical to conduct a placebo randomized controlled trial, which is one of the most powerful tools in the development of safe and effective medical treatments. They write “the ethics of giving a placebo rather than treatment to a vitamin D deficient patient with this potentially fatal disease would need to be evaluated.” The evidence for such a policy is currently non-existent. On the other hand, there are plenty of known risks associated with excess Vitamin D [5].</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The controversial idea that there are universals in the ways we use music received a boost in 2018, with the finding that people from 60 different countries <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/01/musical-universals-people-can-identify-lullabies-and-dance-songs-from-other-cultures/">were pretty good at judging</a> whether a totally unfamiliar piece of music from another culture was intended to soothe a baby or to be danced to. Now, new research involving some of the same team has revealed that foreign lullabies that babies have never heard before work to relax them. </p>



<span id="more-40859"></span>



<p>Constance M. Bainbridge and Mila Bertolo from Harvard University led the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00963-z">new study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, on 144 babies with an average age of 7 months. After being fitted with sensors to monitor their heart rate and level of sweating, each baby sat in a high chair or recliner or on its parent’s lap while watching animated characters lip-synching to 14-second bursts of songs. These songs came from the Natural History of Song Discography, a collection of songs from around the world, and eight were used as lullabies in the societies in which they were selected. The rest were intended to express love, heal the sick or be danced to. All of the songs were sung by solo vocalists, without background music.</p>



<p>As well as looking at the heart rate and skin sweating data, the team used video of the babies’ faces to monitor their pupil size. If these measures decreased, this would indicate that the baby was relaxing.</p>



<p>Based on some of these measures, at least, the team found that babies did indeed seem more relaxed during the lullabies than the other songs. “While heart rates dropped almost immediately following the onset of singing, regardless of song type, this drop was more pronounced during the lullabies,” the team writes. Whether the baby was 2 or 14 months old, the effect was the same, suggesting that it couldn’t simply be the result of exposure to music with age. The team also found that the babies’ pupils were smaller during the lullabies than the other songs.</p>



<p>The sweating results were less clear cut, however. These levels increased over the course of the experiment, perhaps because the babies were becoming more bored and fussy, the researchers suggest. But while a baby listened to a lullaby, this increase was temporarily slowed.</p>



<p>What might explain these effects? The lullabies and the other songs certainly differed acoustically. The lullabies tended to be slower, and to have smaller pitch ranges and a less steady beat. As the researchers note, the earlier work on adults listening to unfamiliar songs found that the more a song was characterised by these specific features, the more confident a listener was that it was intended to be a lullaby. The team then compared these earlier adult ratings with their new results. And they found that the more that the adults had judged a song to be directed towards infants, the bigger the reduction in heart rate while the baby listened to it. “This result confirms that the acoustic effects of the songs drove the relaxation effects on them,” the team writes.</p>



<p>As they stress, the babies and their parents “were unfamiliar with the songs they heard, unfamiliar with the languages they were sung in and unfamiliar with the musical styles of the societies that originally produced the songs.” All the babies in the present study were American, but the researchers suspect that babies from other cultures would react in the same way. (In fact, they are now “eager to find out whether they do so”.)</p>



<p>The new work does open up some fascinating questions, such as: which of the acoustic features of lullabies are most important for the relaxation effect? And: do babies like lullabies more than other songs (or just find them more relaxing)? Also: what impact might lullabies have on a baby’s ongoing health? Numerous studies have found that music can help adults with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782778/">chronic pain</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500733/">depression</a>, for example. “Music may also play an everyday role in improving health in infants,” the researchers write, “a role it has taken on across cultures and across human history.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s no getting around the fact that climate change is an existential crisis of the highest order — but how best to communicate that threat is unclear. Too much pessimism and people become paralysed with anxiety, pushing thoughts about the crisis away altogether. Too much optimism, on the other hand, can lead to complacency — if things are going to be okay, why would we feel the need to engage with what’s going on?</p>



<p>It’s this tension that Brandi S. Morris and colleagues from Aarhus University explore in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00574-z">new study</a>, published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. </em>They suggest that climate change appeals with pessimistic endings could trigger higher engagement with the issue than those that end on an optimistic note.</p>



<span id="more-40853"></span>



<p>In the first study, 200 participants were presented with a transcript of a video about bees and climate change that had either an optimistic or pessimistic ending: in the optimistic condition, participants read that younger beekeepers were learning about and taking action on climate change, while in the pessimistic condition they read that bees were dying “at an alarming rate”. After this, they answered questions about their emotional response (e.g. how emotionally intense it had been to read the article), their beliefs in climate change (how much of a risk they feel it poses to human health), and their political ideology.</p>



<p>Participants in the pessimistic condition felt that climate change was more of a risk than those in the optimistic condition, and also reported higher emotional arousal. There was a direct link between the two: the team found that reading the pessimistic ending triggered greater emotional arousal, which in turn led to greater risk perception. A second study in which participants actually viewed the videos as well as reading the transcripts found a very similar pattern of results.</p>



<p>In both of these studies, people’s politics and worldview also played a part. Conservative participants reported lower levels of risk perception when their emotional arousal was low, as did people with a greater belief in individualism or hierarchy (as compared to collectivism or egalitarianism). But this also meant that emotional arousal triggered more of an increase in risk perception for these groups (compared to more liberal participants, whose risk perception was already high). </p>



<p>In the third and final study, 1,115 participants again saw optimistic and pessimistic materials. This time a third “fatalistic” condition was added, in which participants were told that a reduction in the bee population would mean the “world would crumble” in a mere four years (“No matter what we do about climate change, it’s too late to turn things around”).</p>



<p>After viewing this material, participants filled in the same risk perception and emotional arousal measures, and stated how much they agreed with the statement “I believe my actions have an influence on climate change”.</p>



<p>Participants in both the pessimistic and fatalistic conditions reported higher emotional arousal. And the higher the level of arousal, the more likely a participant was to believe they can make an impact. Political ideology and worldview had similar effects as in the previous studies: belief in ability to change things was particularly low at lower levels of emotional arousal in moderates and conservatives, but increased considerably as a result of increased emotional arousal.</p>



<p>These results suggest that pessimistic messages about climate change may actually boost people’s beliefs that it is a problem and that they can do something to combat it. However, they also imply that those who are creating these kinds of interventions need to think carefully about who they’re aiming to reach and how they intend to do it: if different groups respond differently to positive or negative messaging, then a selection of carefully targeted messages might be more successful than something broader and designed to appeal to everyone.</p>



<p>But ultimately, it’s important not to forget those parties who are <em>really</em> responsible for acting on climate change: governments and corporations. While individuals can of course make a difference, it’s the big polluters who really have to change — according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions"><em>Guardian </em>investigation</a>, just twenty fossil fuel companies are linked to a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. Figures like this make individual actions like turning off lights or recycling water bottles pale somewhat in comparison.</p>



<p>Designing successful interventions for climate action is key, and studies like this are an important part of making sure they work. But those designing them would do well to think about the limits of individual behaviour change — and who should really end up feeling responsible.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/11/16/can-science-be-musical/">Can science be musical?</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-music-notes-edited-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I recently wrote <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03760-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">an article</a> for BMC describing the use of sound to describe the function of the coronavirus genome. It was a perplexing article to write since I was toing and froing about science and art. I was writing a science article which had an art component to it. Was I creating a technical auditory display or was I creating something that was musical? I think I was actually doing both. I have since realised that I was adding an ‘A for Art’ into Science Technology Engineering and Maths to make STE(A)M. I made something that is both functional and creative. I thought if it didn’t sound good then people would not use it as a science tool.</p>
<p>Amongst other things I have been making audio by copying the way a biological cell makes proteins</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12158" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome.

BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020)</div></figure>
<p>I also created an animated display which is synchronised to the audio. The animation scrolls the genomic sequence across the page as if it was interacting with proteins inside a human cell. I did this because I want the user to see the sequence pass by as you hear the audio. Our eyes are attracted to things that move and we naturally listen for patterns in what we hear. I thought the combination of the two would be greater than either in isolation. The music is never going to replace a well-designed (but silent) <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">genome browser</a> but an audio track that is synchronised to a visual browser may help interpret the complex genomic sequences.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM">https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM</a></p>
<p><strong>What is the music trying to say?</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion let’s assume that I have used the coronavirus genome to make instrumental music, since this is often what is assumed. So, the question now is, what is the music trying to say? If it were composed by a human it might say something about the human condition in response to the virus. But the music was composed by a computer algorithm from the genomic sequence and therefore it tells us something about the function of the genome. It tells us something about how the genome is used to make proteins (translation) and how it makes new copies of itself (transcription).</p>
<p><strong>Imagine you are inside a human cell.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the music, you need to imagine that you are inside a human cell, you are a machine (such as a ribosome complex) moving along the viral genomic RNA sequence and converting it into a protein sequence, like a train running down a track. The music of translation begins at a slow tempo whilst we listen to an untranslated region. As we run into a gene sequence, another instrument starts to play the sound of a new protein being made and the music picks tempo up. Occasionally the music pauses in silence as we pass a cleavage point in a coronavirus protein. Almost randomly, syncopated high pitched notes sound out as we pass important regions called stop codons. Conversely, the effect of a start codon may be heard for many minutes after the text sequence has scrolled off the screen. The sound of these and other genomic attributes gives a narrative to the music.</p>
<p>If we are to use colors, shapes and font styles to tell us something about the sequence, then why not use music to tell us this is a new way? The fact that music has a beginning, middle and end is important since this makes us think about the order of features in the genome and this is important to understand their function.</p>
<p><strong>Is the sound musical in its own right? </strong></p>
<p>For days after I submitted the manuscript for review I had the <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">‘so c</a><a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">alled music’</a> of the coronavirus genome in my head. I was wondering if other people would also consider it musical. Music can be inspiring, it should be creative and it can stir human emotion. In contrast, the sound of the coronavirus genome is minimal, repetitive and systematic. To make genomic data more musical I thought I should add some musicians into the mix. Literally!</p>
<p>A musician friend of mine (Mike Anderson) and I went into the music studio. We played the sound of the coronavirus genome very loudly over a big sound system. We set up drums and a loud guitar amp and we played along with the sequence. I made a simple recording of this and called it Coronacode music.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0">https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0</a></p>
<p>After producing Coronacode music it made me think more about generative music (from a computer) versus musical improvisation. When we played along to the code it restricted what we were able to play and this constraint was a source of creativity. It snapped us out of our usual musical patterns and made us play something new. The repeating nucleotides A, U, G and C combine with the repeating drum pattern of kick, snare, tom, kick! Long guitar tones soften the incessant pulse of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><strong>Growing up in public.</strong></p>
<p>This approach is new to me. I think the use of sound to convey patterns in scientific data (sonification) has not yet come of age. Anecdotally I would say there is still skepticism within the scientific community regarding the value of sound. However, since computer browsers are now more capable to process data into audio and visuals I think we will see more instances of its application. If the audio and visual displays are tightly coupled and work together in harmony, then I think it will not only sound good but it will be more informative.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>A recent study finds political differences in how much stock people put in expert evidence versus personal experience. </strong>Liberals tend to see evidence from experts as more legitimate, while conservatives place more equal value on both, <a href="https://theconversation.com/conservatives-value-personal-stories-more-than-liberals-do-when-evaluating-scientific-evidence-149132">write the researchers Randy Stein, Alexander Swan and Michelle Sarraf</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.  This was true even though the scenarios in the study were completely apolitical, the team adds, suggesting that the findings pick up on fundamental differences in worldview between the two camps.</p>

<p><strong>More this week on the effectiveness — or lack thereof — of unconscious bias training</strong>. Companies spend billions on such training every year, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unconscious-bias-diversity-fix">writes Allyssia Alleyne</a> at <em>Wired</em>, yet there’s little evidence that it works to change people’s behaviour. And worse, it can allow organisations to appear to be doing something to improve diversity and inclusion, while avoiding putting in the time and resources to achieve real change.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/638687634/0/oupblogpsychology/">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></h4>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>In the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">first part</a> of </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael Bakan’s interview with his Chapter 7 musician co-author Graeme Gibson (who is on the spectrum) and Graeme’s parents, the renowned science fiction novelist William (Bill) Gibson and autism researcher Dr Deborah Gibson</em><em>,</em><strong> </strong><em>things left off with Bill telling Michael about how being Graeme’s dad had influenced his creation of “unnervingly human” AI (Artificial Intelligence) characters in his novels. Next in the conversation, Michael invited Bill to talk about the very significant influence of music generally—and specific musicians in particular—on his creative process as a writer. We pick up the conversation from that point.  </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> That’s really interesting [to learn how being Graeme’s father inspired your “humanization” of AI characters in your books], Bill, and leads me to another question, specifically having to do with how music has influenced you as a writer.</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Well, I’m not at all musical, and neither is Deb, but we have both in our lives been very, very intensely moved by music. I’m just kind of a folk and pop guy (Deb’s tastes are broader; she has a library of operas), but yes, music has influenced me greatly as a writer. When I was starting to write, around age twelve or thirteen, I loved science fiction and read a great whack of it. But then, you know, puberty arrived, and I thought it was like a childhood thing and put it on the side. But when I began to think about writing again, I was dismayed by how uncool, to my mind, the science fiction that was being produced in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s, was. I thought it had become like Nashville country: formulaic, nothing there that I would be interested in. And what I wanted science fiction to be, as I thought, was more like Dylan going electric.</p><p>So I was more consciously inspired by Steely Dan’s lyrics than I was by any of the science fiction that I could see being written when I first started to write. Then I found there were other people around trying for the same effect, other writers whose science fiction <em>looked </em>more like Steely Dan’s lyrics than the rest of the science fiction that was written… And when I started going to London on publishing-related business, the best science fiction store in town was right across the street from the studios where David Bowie recorded his first three or four albums. And the people in the stores—they would have loved David Bowie anyways—but they particularly loved him because he’d always been one of their very best customers, since before he started recording. And they could see that he was taking what he was buying from them, taking it home, fully digesting it, and bringing it back into the recording studio. So that’s an art of sound thing in its own way. I love it that I know that story and that I know it’s true.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> So do you feel that there’s some similar kind of process, specifically relative to music, that went on in your own writing?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> No, it was more like an ambition that there could be an analogy, and I knew that some of the most progressive science fiction being written when I was fourteen years old was being written by people who were already being inspired by the roots of the music of what we think of as the ‘60s. But their influence had faded away by the time I came back in my mid-twenties after getting a BA in English literature, and I was looking at contemporary science fiction and going, “Oh, man. This is not happening for me.” So my ambition was to, you know, make that analogy happen again… I remember listening to Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska” and imagining what it would be like if it were a science fiction novel.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>B: </strong>That was what I would do. I would listen to a piece of music and it would really move me and be unlike anything quite like what I’d heard before. And I’d think, “Yeah, but what would that be like if it were a piece of science fiction? What would that look like as a piece of science fiction?” And that would be a starting point for something.</p><div><figure><img height="270" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1aF5qKfJg.jpg" width="300" />Bill with Graeme reading.

What essential lessons has being Graeme’s mom taught you, and how have those lessons impacted your life?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> So one of the things I learned, I guess <em>had</em> to learn, was that we had to create our own experience and ways to get Graeme his best life, and ways for us to get through it without going completely berserk <em>[laughter]. </em>It was hard because there wasn’t the level of support that there is now, and we were, like, very impoverished really—well, not really—but we were very low income earners at the time. So it was difficult, but I managed, and I realized that I had to get another persona in order to find out what I wanted to know about Graeme, because every test that he had, everything that I pushed for, they would just give me the “mom” version.</p><p>And I knew there was another version that went amongst the professionals, that would use medical vocabulary and such. I needed to learn it, and I did learn it (that knowledge base eventually became the foundation for my PhD dissertation research, in fact, which was a case study on Graeme’s language acquisition) and I was able, therefore, to push quite far into getting information about Graeme that made me then feel like I had the information to take to, say, the school board or medical world, and to ask for things that were not there.</p><p>You know, Graeme was the first child with autism that that was integrated into the Vancouver School Board, to not be in a segregated class. And so I think just having a child who was “different” pushed me in a way that I was unwillingly pushed, but that nonetheless was an important maturation. I had a very cute baby, and one that was enchantingly different from others I knew. And it was delightful! Graeme’s babyhood was not all difficulties. He was so funny, and unique—very strong in what he liked and what he didn’t like. And what he liked were dots on the wall. He liked to find these microscopic dots and do this thing with sound, and touching them very slowly, and then screaming. He would play with things for hours and hours, but he hated primary colors, and all the toys were in primary colors. It was just really interesting, and often comical, and, I don’t know, there were wonderful things about being Graeme’s mother, wonderful things that I definitely wouldn’t have experienced if he had been a more “typical” child.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Let’s bring it all back full circle to Graeme. Graeme, what are three lessons you would like readers to take away from this interview, especially relative to your experiences as a member of your family?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> First, I’ll always say that you have to keep in mind that all people on the spectrum are different from each other. People on the spectrum have different needs. You have to find a way to accommodate their needs, to meet them on their own terms. You have to know who they are individually. So that in itself is more the challenge, but once that’s established, in my family we’ve gone much beyond that, so it’s pretty continuous in the way that information flows from me to Mom and Dad by email or in person. I’ve gotten very good at asking for what I need, and at articulating what I want, and what I don’t want.</p><p>The second thing I’ll talk about, which is actually related, is the constant communication. That’s what keeps us together in my family, even though we don’t spend very much time actually together anymore, except when we travel, like the trip to England last year.</p><p>Third would probably be mutual support, like how my parents have found me teachers and other people who have helped me to develop my skills, like my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, and when I was young, my music therapist Johanne Brodeur. That does count in the overall picture.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Those are great. Thanks, Graeme. Deborah? Bill? Anything to add along related lines?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> I think I have to keep being reminded that I have to respect Graeme’s boundaries about what is really hard for him. Because there are lots of things that I think would be maybe fun to do, and Graeme finds them difficult in ways that I haven’t expected. Or I’ll suggest something that’s spontaneous, and that doesn’t work for Graeme. He likes to plan ahead. So I have to keep being reminded, even though it’s been 43 years, that there are big differences between what I think is easy and what Graeme finds easy. In lots of ways it can be, in my opinion, something small that Graeme sticks on, but for him it’s huge, so that’s something that I’ve had to adjust to.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, that’s so important. Bill?</p><p>B. I’ll just amplify what Deb said, that respecting who Graeme is has been really, really essential, and like an ongoing project for sure. It’s not something one perfectly masters.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, like having this interview happen today, and getting Graeme’s cooperation, was something we really had to work on together. You sitting here for all this time—almost an hour and a half—mainly listening to us talk? I thank you for that, Graeme.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Mm-hmm…</p><p><strong>M:</strong> And I thank all of you. This has been really enlightening, and inspiring!</p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/slItfWbhijc">Syd Wachs</a>. </em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638687634/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638687634/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1aF5qKfJg.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p> </p>
<p>No one wants to find errors in their work, but there’s something even worse: errors that pass through undetected, causing headaches later.</p>
<p>arXiv relies on TeXLive 2020 as a compilation system to ensure precise formatting of the submissions from our authors. During the submission process, authors upload their TeX files to the arXiv system, which then compiles them into a PDF. Now, compilation errors will be highlighted during the submission process, helping authors save time and submit their work smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_796" style="width: 583px;"><img alt="Image of TeX error highlighting" class="wp-image-796 size-full" height="243" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Highlighting-Key.png" width="583" />TeX errors detected by the arXiv submission system are now color-coded</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Different types of compilation errors might arise during the submission process. Some errors are so severe that the submission system will not compile the source files into a PDF until they are resolved. For example, if the TeX source references a file that the author forgot to include, processing will fail. Other errors are less obvious at first glance. For example, an error might interfere with formatting, making the content less understandable, or, if references are missing, a question mark will appear instead of numbers corresponding to the bibliography.</p>
<p>During the compilation process, AutoTeX log files are produced automatically and errors are noted within. In the past, many users found the large block of text challenging to read and interpret quickly.</p>
<p>Now, errors are highlighted with different colors within the AutoTeX logs during the submission process. Authors can quickly scan a summary of errors, understand their severity, and follow links to relevant arXiv help pages. Additionally, if the source did compile, the number of pages produced is also noted, so authors can confirm that the paper length matches their expectation.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_801" style="width: 1024px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error.png"><img alt="image of critical tex error summary" class="wp-image-801 size-large" height="311" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error-1024x311.png" width="1024" /></a>This example shows the summary of critical errors, attempted compilation runs, and a link to the relevant arXiv help page.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>By scrolling down the AutoTeX log, authors will find specific errors highlighted in various colors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_802" style="width: 818px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png"><img alt="TeX Error highlighting example" class="wp-image-802 size-full" height="693" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png" width="818" /></a>In this example, an error log shows where the specific errors occurred.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>arXiv aims to serve both readers and authors by ensuring that research can be shared quickly and easily. This AutoTeX log highlighting feature was specifically requested by arXiv authors and will likely improve their experience. Readers will also benefit because, with fewer technical errors, articles will be easier to read.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a> </p>



<p>You’re walking through a dark, dingy house. Floorboards creak and you think you hear something moving in the shadows. Suddenly, an engine revs and a blood-splattered man wearing a pig’s head lunges towards you with a chainsaw. You scream and run away. Terrifying, perhaps — but it also sounds kind of fun, right?</p>



<p>We generally think of fear as a negative emotion — something that signals danger and which is unpleasant to experience. Yet so many of us seek out situations that make us scared: haunted fairground rides, scary video games, and horror movies and novels. And now researchers have looked at exactly how the experience of fear is related to our enjoyment of this kind of “recreational horror”. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620972116">Writing in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, the team finds that there’s a sweet spot when it comes to creating a scary but enjoyable experience: if you end up feeling too little fear — or too much — then it’s not quite as fun.</p>



<span id="more-40836"></span>



<p>Marc Malmdorf Anderson from Aarhus University and colleagues studied visitors to “<a href="https://dystopia.dk/haunted-house/">Dystopia Haunted House</a>”, a Danish live-action horror attraction, in which people walk through the rooms of a house and are confronted with actors playing spooky characters.</p>



<p>Before entering the haunted house, participants were fitted with heart rate monitors so that the researchers could look at their physiological response throughout the experience.  Once they had emerged at the other end, participants rated how scared they had been and how enjoyable they had found the haunted house overall. They also rated their fear and enjoyment for three specific locations in the house in which they had encountered a “jump scare” (zombies suddenly jumping out from a staircase, for example, or the aforementioned pig man chasing them with a chainsaw).</p>



<p>Overall, participants reported that the haunted house was both scary and enjoyable. And when the team looked at the link between fear and enjoyment across those three jump scare moments, they found a significant relationship. This took an inverse U shape:  the more scared people reported feeling, the greater their enjoyment — up to a point. When their fear exceeded this point (which was around 6 or so on a scale that went from 0 to 9) then their enjoyment tended to decrease again.</p>



<p>This suggests that for a scary experience to be at its most enjoyable, it needs to hit a “sweet spot” so that it is not too tame — but also not exceedingly scary. This makes sense when you think of recreational horror as a form of play, the authors write. We already know that other aspects of play rely on the conditions being “just right”: for example, in order to stimulate people’s curiosity, a challenge shouldn’t be so easy as to make it boring, but also not so hard or confusing that it is impossible.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that small-scale fluctuations in participants’ heart rate were related to feelings of enjoyment in a similar way (“small-scale” here refers to fluctuations that occurred across periods of just a few seconds, rather than longer-term changes in heart rate across the entire experience).  People whose heart rate fluctuated more moment-to-moment tended to report more enjoyment — but again, only up to a point. When these fluctuations became too great, then enjoyment began to decrease again. These results suggest that people also hit a sweet spot of physiological arousal when they’re enjoying a scary experience. </p>



<p>There are lots more questions to explore — in particular, it would be interesting to know exactly <em>why</em> enjoyment decreases when an experience becomes too scary. Do people simply become overwhelmed? Do they stop recognising that they are in a safe, artificial environment? Or could the physical signs of intense fear be souring the experience?  </p>



<p>As the authors point out, it would also be interesting to know whether there’s a similar relationship between fear and enjoyment for other media like video games or movies. Still, the “naturalistic” aspect of their research is pretty cool, and is a nice example of work extending beyond the artificial environment of the lab. Not many other studies on fear can boast that they terrified participants with an actual chainsaw-wielding pig man.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Audrey Hepburn’s face and Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. Darcy Bussell dancing the role of Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and <em>The Starry Night</em> by Vincent van Gogh. All of these things, and more, are widely regarded as looking beautiful. Do we have, then, a “beauty centre” in the brain that responds to something that we find visually beautiful, no matter what it is? For almost two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have been exploring this question, without reaching a consensus. Now a new meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies on almost 1,000 people concludes that no, our brains don’t have one “beauty centre” — but two.</p>



<span id="more-40829"></span>



<p>Hu Chuan-Peng at Tsinghua University, China, led <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00827-z">the study</a>, published in <em>Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioural Neuroscience</em>. The team identified 49 studies that involved whole brain analyses of young and middle-aged people (aged 18 – 50), none of whom were art experts. Some of these studies focused on responses to human faces, while others looked at reactions to art, including paintings, sculpture, visual textures, dance videos and architectural space. In all cases, fMRI was used to image the brains of the participants, who also made aesthetic judgements, or at least rated how much they liked or disliked a given stimulus.</p>



<p>Using a technique called “activation likelihood estimation” (ALE) meta-analysis, the team searched for any crossover between the studies in patterns of brain activity while participants viewed stimuli that they judged to be beautiful.</p>



<p>This analysis revealed that beautiful faces triggered greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and adjacent pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and also the left ventral striatum, compared with faces rated as being not beautiful. However, this wasn’t the case for art. Beautiful visual art was associated with more activity not in these regions but in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC).</p>



<p>What might explain those different response patterns? The ventral striatum is already known to be a key part of the brain’s reward pathway, so the team thinks that the structure responds to the rewarding value of a beautiful face. This signal, along with other information, is then integrated into the vmPFC, to generate the positive feeling associated with perceiving facial beauty.</p>



<p>Beautiful faces, then, seem to be more like “primary rewards”, similar to food and sexual contact — rewards that benefit our (or our genes’) survival and which are inherently pleasurable. Viewing beautiful art is, though, more like getting money: a “secondary reward”, or something that we have learned to find pleasurable. As such, it’s handled differently in the brain — it’s perceived as being beautiful due to high-level, top-down processing in the aMPFC. (Earlier work has found an involvement for the aMPFC in secondary rewards, the team notes.)</p>



<p>It’s perhaps worth noting that what this new study can’t do — and was not designed to do — is contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The team’s meta-analysis revealed similarities in how people across the studies process “beautiful” vs “not beautiful” faces and visual art, but what was beautiful, or not, was judged by each individual. Neither, of course, can the study shed light on how we process non-visual beauty — such as “beautiful” music, for example. Further research will be necessary to reveal how this fits in; perhaps we have yet more “beauty centres”.</p>



<p>Still, debate about the nature of beauty goes back millennia. Plato wrote of a “common and abstract beauty” that is independent of the various forms of beautiful things, an idea that is still entertained today. This new study suggests that this is not the way our brains see things: we don’t perceive an “essence” of beauty in all manner of objects, but rather respond to at least two distinct types.</p>

<h2>Background</h2><p class="">In the 16th century, an eminent French<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon"> barber surgeon</a> named Ambroise Pare noted—with amazement—that some of his patients who had undergone limb amputation complained months later that they still felt sensations (including pain) coming from their missing limb. Pare’s observation is thought to be the first recorded description of <em>phantom limb</em>, a condition in which sensations continue to occur in a part of the body that has been lost (due to accident or injury) or surgically removed. Despite the name, phantom limb doesn’t only occur in limbs, and has also been recorded after the loss or removal of other parts of the body—like breasts, genitals, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15101965/" target="_blank">and even teeth</a>.</p><p class="">Although Pare wrote about phantom limb in the 1500s, the term <em>phantom limb</em> wouldn’t first be used until the Civil War—more than three centuries later. At that time, the renowned physician Silas Weir Mitchell was an army surgeon stationed at the South Street Hospital in Philadelphia. So many amputees were treated at South Street Hospital (especially after the Battle of Gettysburg) that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5325361/" target="_blank">soldiers called it “Stump Hospital.”</a> Mitchell noted that most of the amputees he treated there continued to experience sensations from their missing limbs. He described these lingering sensations as “sensory ghosts” or “phantoms,” which led to the use of the term <em>phantom limb</em> to describe the condition.</p><p class="">Today, phantom sensations are recognized as a common experience in those who have lost a limb. It’s thought that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053811/" target="_blank">almost all amputees have phantom sensations</a>, and the majority of them also suffer from some degree of phantom pain. In one study of 5000 American veterans, for example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6709380/" target="_blank">78% of them reported experiencing phantom pain in their amputated limbs</a>. </p><p class="">The presentation of phantom sensations can vary from patient to patient. In most cases, the sensations begin almost immediately after the surgery or injury that led to the loss of the limb (after consciousness has returned and any anesthetic has worn off). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">But in about a quarter of patients</a>, the sensations may not appear for several days or weeks. Sometimes the phantom sensations fade away after a few days or weeks, but in other cases they persist for years—or even decades.</p><p class="">In many patients, the phantom limb takes on a habitual posture (e.g., arm slightly bent). But that posture may change spontaneously, and some patients complain that their phantom limb ends up in awkward positions that generate discomfort and pain. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">One anecdotal report describes a patient</a> who lost a limb after a grenade exploded in it. He complained that his phantom hand was perpetually held in a painful, tightly-clenched fist.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What causes phantom limb?</h2><p class="">Phantom limb is still not very well understood. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain it, but it’s likely that the underlying mechanism differs slightly from case to case. In this article, I’ll discuss a few of the most common explanations for phantom limb. In an individual patient, it’s very possible more than one of the following mechanisms is at play—or that other explanations altogether are involved.</p><h3>Changes to the central nervous system</h3>

<p class="">The prevailing explanation for phantom limb sensations is an idea known as <em>cortical reorganization</em> or <em>cortical remapping</em>. To explain this hypothesis, let’s consider the case of an individual who loses their arm in an accident. Before the accident, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carried sensations from the arm communicated with neurons in a region known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>, which receives information about touch, pain, temperature, and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/proprioception" target="_blank">proprioception</a> (i.e., the position of the body in space) from all over the body. Specifically, neurons carrying information from the arm interact with neurons in a part of the somatosensory cortex devoted to processing information about arm sensations. </p><p class="">After the accident, however, those somatosensory neurons are deprived of their normal source of neuronal input. Consequently, they begin to respond to signaling from other nearby neurons. This can cause sensations felt in other parts of the body (e.g., the face) to lead to the stimulation of neurons in the somatosensory cortex that are devoted to the (now missing) arm. The activation of these “arm” somatosensory neurons causes the brain to perceive sensations in the arm, even though it is no longer there. The extent to which this type of maladaptive cortical reorganization <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777055/" target="_blank">occurs is correlated with the severity of phantom limb pain</a>. </p><p class="">It should be noted that reorganization in non-cortical areas, like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> (a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> structure involved in processing nearly all incoming sensory information) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450753/" target="_blank">also seems to play a role</a> in some phantom sensations.</p><h3>Body representation</h3><p class="">Another popular explanation for phantom limb centers around the idea that the brain typically relies on an internal representation of the body for generating an awareness of where our body is in space—and thus for maintaining posture, making movements, etc. This internal representation of the body is likely created by networks of neurons that integrate information of various types in the brain (e.g., tactile, visual—even emotional). </p><p class="">According to some researchers, the internal representation of the body can be the root of phantom limb sensations and pain. This might occur when, after a limb is lost, the body representation remains intact. In other words, the representation of the body generated in the patient’s brain still includes the intact limb, creating an expectation or sense that the limb is still present. This might lead to abnormal sensations, discomfort, or pain when incoming sensory information conflicts with the neural body representation (e.g., the eyes see that no leg is present, but the brain still expects a leg to be there). </p><h3>Peripheral nervous system</h3><p class="">In the early days of phantom limb research, the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/peripheral-nervous-system" target="_blank">peripheral nervous system</a> was thought to be the sole cause of phantom limb pain. Today, explanations typically involve the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/central-nervous-system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> as well, but the peripheral nervous system is still believed to be an important factor. </p><p class="">After the loss of a limb, the damaged <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/axon" target="_blank">axons</a> that once supplied the limb don’t simply stay idle. Instead, they often attempt to repair themselves by growing new extensions (a process called <em>sprouting</em>). After loss of a limb, however, these new extensions essentially have nowhere to go. They form a mass of neural tissue at the site of amputation called a <em>neuroma</em>.</p><p class="">The axons that make up the neuroma do not remain dormant. Instead, they can generate <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/action-potential" target="_blank">action potentials</a> in an erratic manner. This aberrant signaling is thought to be a potential mechanism underlying some of the spontaneous pain phantom limb patients can experience. The abnormal neural activity might be exacerbated by pathological signaling coming from the area where the axons from the missing limb enter the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>Treatments for phantom limb pain</h2><p class="">There are a number of pharmacological treatments for phantom limb pain. They include many of the same pain-relieving drugs used to treat other types of neuropathic pain, such as anticonvulsant and opioid drugs. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatment, however, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30349693/" target="_blank">tends to be variable</a>—which likely reflects the numerous causes underlying phantom limb pain.</p>

<p class="">One unique approach to treating phantom limb pain is called <em>mirror therapy</em>. In this technique, a mirror is situated between the missing and intact limb so it reflects the patient’s intact limb. This creates the illusion (from the patient’s perspective) that they have two intact limbs. They can move their intact limb and observe the illusory limb moving in the same manner. It is thought that this imagery may help to reduce some of the discomfort caused by the lack of visual feedback from a missing limb that the brain has maintained an internal representation of. </p><p class="">Although <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18032777/" target="_blank">studies support the effectiveness of mirror therapy</a>, the mechanisms underlying why the approach works are not fully understood. Some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327313/" target="_blank">research, however, suggests mirror therapy may </a>help to reverse the post-amputation cortical reorganization mentioned above. The effectiveness of mirror therapy has increased interest in similar approaches, like using virtual reality to create a representation of a limb. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Collins KL, Russell HG, Schumacher PJ, Robinson-Freeman KE, O'Conor EC, Gibney KD, Yambem O, Dykes RW, Waters RS, Tsao JW.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It’s become somewhat of a truism that you shouldn’t believe everything you see on social media. Where someone’s life looks perfect, we’re often reminded, there are probably a handful of problems silently situated away from the camera. Nobody’s life is as shiny, flawless, or enviable as it might appear in their carefully curated feed.</p>



<p>But presenting ourselves more authentically on social media — ditching those things we want to believe are true about ourselves in favour of those that are — could be good for our wellbeing, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18539-w">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> by Erica R. Bailey from Columbia University and colleagues.</p>



<span id="more-40820"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team looked at the data of 10,560 Facebook users who had completed both personality and life satisfaction assessments through the myPersonality app (the data was originally collected between 2007 and 2012 and made available for approved researchers to study, though the app has since been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/facebook-bans-first-app-since-cambridge-analytica-mypersonality-and-suspends-hundreds-more">banned by Facebook</a> for improper data protection). These assessments were then compared to predictions of personality from Facebook likes and from status updates, to give a measure of how “authentically” the users presented themselves on the platform.</p>



<p>There was a positive correlation between life satisfaction and authenticity — but no indication, however, of the direction of causality. In other words, it wasn’t clear whether authenticity led to greater wellbeing or vice-versa.</p>



<p>To further examine the direction of cause-and-effect, the team asked 90 participants to spend two weeks posting on social media in a particular manner. For one week, they were asked to post in an authentic way, and for the other in a self-idealised way — i.e. posting in the way they would <em>like</em> to be seen rather than the way they really are. At the end of each week, participants recorded their subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, mood, and positive and negative affect.</p>



<p>After the week of authentically posting, participants reported significantly higher levels of wellbeing, mood, and positive affect. There was also a marginally significant impact on negative affect, though overall life satisfaction was not affected. This suggests that authentic posting might actually lead to higher levels of wellbeing than self-idealised posting.</p>



<p>But <em>why</em> people behave the way they do on social media should be considered in further research. People may have different motivations for self-idealising online, which could affect how they feel while doing so. If you’re not self-aware and feel you’re simply sharing things that really do authentically reflect who you are, does that have the same impact on wellbeing as actively deviating from your real self-view? It’s also unclear whether posting authentically is actually any better than not posting at all.</p>



<p>But for those of us who do post online, it might be a good reminder to resist the pressure to present a perfect life online. Seeing online friends or influencers as normal people, rather than unattainably idealistic, can be deeply reassuring — there’s a reason there’s been a rise, for example, in “skin-positive influencers”, who share pictures of acne and scars. And this study suggests that such authenticity doesn’t just benefit others — there’s a chance it might make you feel better, too.</p>

It combines tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering towards the understanding of human biology and disease and the improvement of human health.</p>
<p>We spoke with one of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s Editorial Board Members (EBMs), Professor Seeram Ramakrishna from the National University of Singapore, about his perspective on the journal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When and how did you become an EBM for <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> was launched in 2018, and published its first article in January 2019. I was invited to submit a review article to <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> by the Editor, Dr. Lingling Tian. I was impressed with the professionalism and quality of the peer review process, and hence got interested in <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>. Upon invitation and foresight discussions with Lingling, I gladly accepted to join the editorial board of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> in July 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Compared with other journals in the field, especially well-known ones, what makes <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering </em>different?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> considers quality articles on all aspects of biomedical engineering.  Specific topics include biomaterials, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, medical technologies, robotics and rehabilitation engineering, Biomechanics, biosensors and bioelectronics, and Biomedical Imaging. As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p>
<p>In addition, BMC is a pioneer of open access publishing. This year makes the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of BMC! As part of the BMC Series journals, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> is a fully open access journal. Published articles are free to read and share.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How’s the paper quality of the journal and what’s your opinion on the <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">review policy</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has a professional in-house editorial team, with support from a strong and international <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">editorial board</a>. It offers a rigorous, efficient and fair peer review service. Since its launch, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has been receiving good quality submissions from around the world. <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s editorial policy requires that the reported studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles, this includes a scientifically-sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field.  <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> achieved a good measure of success with 42 <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">articles published</a> and consistently improves its standards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you please share what suggestions you have for the journal’s future development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We aim to grow <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> into a renowned biomedical engineering journal with global impact in the next few years. This is a very promising biomedical engineering journal, on which I aspire to publish my own work.</p>
<p>In addition, I would encourage the Editors to provide more support to the authors in the research community, in particular to the junior ones who are at their early stage of research. They might be not very experienced with writing and publishing their research in scientific journal. The editors could support them by giving presentations or seminars on topics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What suggestions do you have for young researchers and author who would like to submit their paper to open access journal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Open access is a good way to share and disseminate knowledge, which gives readers free and instant access, enabling faster discovery of the latest research. Young researchers are encouraged to submit their work to open access journal if their funding allows.</p>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>Earlier this year, </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael B. Bakan sat down for a Zoom conversation with his Chapter 7 co-author, the Vancouver-based multi-instrumentalist and music instrument collector Graeme Gibson, and with Graeme’s parents, autism researcher Dr. Deborah Gibson and bestselling science fiction author William (Bill) Gibson. Their four-way conversation covered a range of topics, from how raising a child on the spectrum shaped Bill’s writing of iconic novels like </em>Neuromancer, <em>to how Deborah’s advocacy on Graeme’s behalf helped to spearhead the movement toward inclusive public education in Vancouver, to how Graeme’s abiding fascination with musical instruments—combined with his prodigious research and memory—enabled him to identify virtually every instrument in the expansive world instrument collection of London’s Horniman Museum. Here is part one of the interview; <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">read part two here</a>. </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> Hello, Graeme, Deborah, and Bill! Thank you so much for doing this interview. I’ve really been looking forward to it.</p><p>Graeme, a question for you for starters: You have a collection of, what, more than 400 musical instruments? And these instruments are from all over the world, and you can actually <em>play</em> most of them, some very well, which is really impressive. How did your interest in musical instruments start?</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Wasn’t there a little electric keyboard you used to play when you were really little?</p><p><strong>Graeme (G):</strong> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There was, and that’s also what propelled me to be able to learn where the notes are laid out on the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Deborah (D):</strong> Actually, it wasn’t electric—Michael, I think I sent you a picture of Graeme playing it when he was a toddler—it was this tuneless<em> </em>little wooden toy piano that we got him for his second Christmas (he was one year old), and he was so mesmerized by it. From the time he was a baby, Graeme was just so interested in sound, and he showed a real affinity for instruments of all kinds. He liked Santa’s jingle bells more than any other present. He was just drawn to music and sound, and when we had records he would <em>insist</em> on Bill playing them over and over again. At that point he was signing rather than speaking, and he would make a very insistent gesture, spinning his finger around in circles like a record spinning on a turntable, to say to Bill, ‘Play it again, play it again!’</p><div><figure><img height="239" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with toy piano.

In terms of instruments from other world cultures, my first major acquisition was a Russian balalaika.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> What I remember is that Graeme walked up to me one day and said, “I want a balalaika.” <em>[Graeme laughs]</em> And I only barely knew what a balalaika was: it’s triangular, it’s a Russian, like… something. How on earth do you think you ever decided to get a balalaika?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> I might have heard it somewhere, maybe the radio or something. I sort of had an idea of what it was and the way that it was played. It’s just the way my ears pick it up. I wish I could explain that, but unfortunately, I can’t translate that software here, so… And later, especially after I started studying with my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, who owns thousands of instruments from around the world, he introduced me to many other instruments as well—especially stringed instruments, which are my specialty—and my collection grew and grew. Now I have an <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~museumofworldmusic.com/">online instrument museum</a> where people can visit my collection.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Right, and I seem to recall that you enjoy visiting “live” musical instrument museums as well, right, Graeme?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes! Like last year, when Mom and Dad and I went to London.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> There was a wonderful museum of ethnic musical instruments.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yeah! The Horniman Museum in, uh… I forget where exactly it is, but, uh…</p><p><strong>D:</strong> It wasn’t close.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> No, it was far, but well worth it.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> And Graeme knew the name of every single instrument without even looking at the label.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> He was the most incredible museum guide, and he would describe the slight discrepancies between that version of the instrument and then the one that came from twenty miles further south. It was a real eye opener for me on how much Graeme knows about music, about instruments, about all things music-related.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, his knowledge—of instruments, the Indian <em>raga </em>system, you name it—is immense. When I assign our chapter in the <em>Music and Autism</em> book to my students, I’ll say to them, ‘Check out how much this guy knows. You’re Ph.D. ethnomusicology students; you should know as much as he does!’ <em>[laughter]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> And we have to thank Randy [Raine-Reusch] for that. He’s just been an extraordinary teacher for Graeme.<em> </em>And as far back as when he was a baby, it wasn’t just music and instruments that interested Graeme. It was sounds of <em>all</em> kinds. When the fridge went on and off…</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Usually around 9 p.m. or so. <em>[Deborah and Bill laugh]</em> Yeah, yeah. There would always be that time, sometime in the evening, when it was very routine. You’d hear the click, and then you’d hear the fridge cycles. <em>[Deborah laughs]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> I gotta say, I never, ever paid attention to our fridge before in that way. <em>[laughter] </em></p><div><figure><img height="200" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1borx4S-A.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with some of his instruments. Photo by Michael O’Shea, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>M:</strong> A question for you now, Bill. At the same time that you were being a stay-at-home dad to Graeme, in the late 1970s/early 1980s, you were also working on your first novel, <em>Neuromancer</em>, which would of course bring you considerable fame—not to mention revolutionize the literature of science fiction, inspire the iconic <em>Matrix </em>film series, and (along with some of your earlier short stories) even change the English language with your coining of the term “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oed.com/view/Entry/240849">cyberspace</a>” and such. I have to think that being a first-time dad—and a dad to Graeme in particular—would have influenced your writing during that time. True?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> I think that being Graeme’s dad made me think more actively about consciousness and perception than I would have otherwise, that is, had I not had that experience, because I had the example of Graeme totally perceiving everything, but perceiving it often in a slightly other way. And I think, particularly for someone that writes the sort of fiction I write, that’s a hugely useful example to have every day, as opposed to, you know, watching everyone else doing what everyone else is doing with the information they’re receiving, although that’s essential too.</p><p>Also, on a practical level, as it became more evident that Graeme wasn’t “just any baby,” it sort of upped the ante on what I was doing. And I also was in a situation where if I was going to be doing anything other than co-parenting Graeme, the perfect thing to do would be trying to become a writer, because you do it from home, literally any time of day, you know, whenever Graeme was asleep, for instance, which is when I did a lot of my writing. So, in some ways it was sort of a natural fit. Yeah, I can’t think of anything else I could have done. And I was lucky, because I was able to make a living at being a freelance writer of fiction, even though, looking back on it, there’s almost no one else I ever knew who tried to do that who was able to do it; they all wound up having day jobs. And I have yet to have one, I’m happy to say.</p><p>And there’s one other thing I’ve wondered about, too, that seems relevant to your question. Something that’s been consistent through my work are characters who are AIs, they’re Artificial Intelligences, but are unnervingly human in their presentation, and seemingly in their consciousness. As far as I know they’re much more totally human than we have any right to expect Artificial Intelligences in the future to be, at least so far. So, something that happens, I know from watching reader feedback, is that readers become invested in the AI’s humanity, but then are occasionally henceforth startled by moments of cognitive dissonance where they realize that it’s human but it’s not quite standardly human. And that’s the result of me, if it were music <em>playing</em> it a certain way, to get that effect of deliberately going slightly off key to remind the reader that the character’s not “standard issue” human. And, you know, that may be something subsequent to being Graeme’s dad.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">Read part two of the interview here.</a></p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/cW3nDFVpi10">Karim Manjra</a></em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638548362/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p>Starting today, authors now have a new license option for their submitted works, the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>. This is the <strong>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</strong> license, which stipulates that others can share the work only with proper attribution and no commercial or derivative works can be made from it.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_781" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="image of creative commons logo" class="wp-image-781 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/createive-commons-logo-150x150.png" width="150" />Creative Commons helps overcome legal obstacles to knowledge sharing</figure>
<p>When an author submits work to arXiv, they choose from a selection of licenses that prescribe how others can –or cannot– use their article. This is critical because, as a repository for scholarly material, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every article and version posted. arXiv needs permission from the copyright holder to host and distribute the work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the person who submits the work, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license.</p>
<p>Authors often ask arXiv for advice on choosing the appropriate license. In general, arXiv values openness and encourages choosing a liberal license for reuse of articles. However, each situation is unique, and arXiv cannot make any specific recommendations. Authors need to consider that journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Funding and government agencies might require specific licenses. The license chosen during arXiv submission is irrevocable and cannot be changed, but different versions of the same work can have different licenses.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_778" style="width: 1341px;"><img alt="screenshot of license options" class="wp-image-778 size-full" height="227" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/List-of-available-licenses-with-arrow.png" width="1341" />Available licenses are listed in the submission system. The purple arrow points to the new option, CC BY-NC-ND.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license was added to arXiv’s selections because many authors submit works that have already been accepted to journals, which each have their own unique policies regarding copyright and article reuse. With this option, authors can comply with the policies of some journals, while also extending permissions to arXiv and others to openly share their work.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content, obtain permission from their coauthors, and certify that they have the right to grant that specific license.</p>
<p>In addition to seeing the new option, authors may notice that the order of the licenses listed in the submission system has changed. The licenses, with the exception of CC Zero, are now ordered from most liberal re-use at the top (CC-BY) to most limited re-use (arXiv.org perpetual non-exclusive). For the top five options, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv. The exception, CC Zero, is rarely used and allows creators to waive their right to enforce copyright and put their works into the worldwide public domain.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s likely to be a diverse set of factors driving any given person’s interest in politics. It could be that their parents had a political affiliation they’ve subsequently inherited; they may have had a personal experience that changed how they see the world; politics could provide a social life or community connections; they might consider political action a civic duty; or they might just be passionate about a particular issue.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220919212">recent paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, there may be another motivation, too — namely narcissism. The paper finds that particular kinds of narcissism are related to taking part in political activities, suggesting that deeply rooted individual factors may play a large part in our willingness to engage in politics.</p>



<span id="more-40811"></span>



<p>Zoltán Fazekas from Copenhagen Business School and Peter K. Hatemi from The Pennsylvania State University explored the link between narcissism and political participation through three surveys: one in Denmark, with 2,450 participants, and two in the US, with 500 and 2,280 participants respectively. In each study, participation in politics was measured through an eight-item questionnaire, which gave an overall measure of participation based on how often people took part in various activities like signing a petition, boycotting or buying products for political reasons, participating in protests, attending political meetings, contacting politicians, donating money, contacting the media, and taking part in political forums and discussion groups.</p>



<p>Narcissism was measured using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, with participants asked to choose between two opposing statements (e.g., “I insist upon getting the respect that is due me” vs. “I usually get the respect that I deserve”). From these questions an overall score is generated, as well as scores for different facets of narcissisms.</p>



<p>As anticipated, there were significant and positive correlations between narcissism and political participation across all three studies, with more narcissistic people participating in politics more than the less narcissistic. The size of this effect was similar to that of other important predictors of political participation like level of education.</p>



<p>There was no relationship between narcissism and voting in general elections, however, though this might be related to high turnout — in the 2011 general election in Denmark, turnout was an impressively high 88%. Voting in US <em>midterm</em> elections, which tend to have lower turnout, was linked to narcissism.</p>



<p>There were also some interesting links between participation and particular facets of narcissism. Higher levels of authority-seeking, perceived leadership ability, and feelings of superiority were consistently associated with taking part in political activities. This makes sense: if you believe yourself to have the qualities of a leader then taking part in political activity could be one way of exercising that sense of moral superiority.</p>



<p>On the other hand, aspects of narcissism like entitlement, exploitativeness, and self-sufficiency were <em>negatively </em>related to participation: people displaying these traits were less likely to engage with politics. This paints a fairly gloomy picture of political participation, with politics guided by “those who both want more but give less”, as the team puts it.</p>



<p>However, the direction of causality in the relationship between narcissism and political participation is unclear. It would be interesting to look at it from another angle: what impact does political participation have on narcissism? In other words, does frequent engagement with politics change people’s personalities? If you’re surrounded by people who share your political convictions, it’s not too much of a leap to believe that you might end up feeling morally superior to others. Those with latent narcissistic traits may also find them coming to the fore when engaging with politics.</p>



<p>Either way, it’s interesting to consider some of the more individual motivations for political participation. For many, political affiliations or stances are deeply personal: they can say something quite profound about who somebody is. The team also suggests that there may be a specific link between narcissism and participation in <em>populist</em> political activities: looking more deeply into individual factors may help us understand why such policies are so popular and why others, perhaps more collectivist or altruistic in nature, fail to gain support.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper "Bacterial colony counting with Convolutional Neural Networks in Digital Microbiology Imaging".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Counting bacterial colonies on microbiological culture plates is a
time-consuming, error-prone, nevertheless essential quantitative task in Clinica
Microbiology Laboratories. With this work we explore the possibility to find
effective solutions to the above issue by designing and testing two different
machine learning approaches. The first one is based on the extraction of a
complete set of handcrafted morphometric and radiometric features used within a
Support Vector Machines solution. The second one is based on the design and
configuration of a Convolutional Neural Networks deep learning architecture. To
validate, in a real and challenging clinical scenario, the proposed bacterial
load estimation techniques, we built and publicly released a fully labeled large
and representative database of both single and aggregated bacterial colonies
extracted from routine clinical laboratory culture plates. Dataset enhancement
approaches have also been experimentally tested for performance optimization.
The adopted deep learning approach outperformed the handcrafted feature based
one, and also a conventional reference technique, by a large margin, becoming a
preferable solution for the addressed Digital Microbiology Imaging quantification
task, especially in the emerging context of Full Laboratory Automation systems.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Pk7WuAFkREY/">PLOS ONE Issues First Publication from Children’s Tumor Foundation Partnership</a></h4>

<p><em>The Children’s Tumor Foundation issued the following press release on November 5, 2020</em></p>



<p>The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the foremost funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to release the first output of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Reports (DDIRR) Award, which CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> <a href="https://www.ctf.org/news/ctf-plos-one-funder-publisher-partnership">first announced in 2017</a>. The Registered Reports model, first piloted by CTF and PLOS ONE, ensures that all valid research – both successes and failures in the lab and clinics – are made public.</p>



<p>The publication, titled <em>Evaluating modified diets and dietary supplement therapies for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and improving muscle function in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), </em>by Dr. Aaron Schindeler, PhD, associate professor at the University of Sydney, reports <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237097">findings</a> on L-Carnitine as an effective dietary supplement for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and potentially addresses muscle weakness and fatigue often observed in NF1 patients. The result of the study led to the opening of a <a href="https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=ACTRN12618002021257">clinical trial</a> for NF1 patients.</p>



<p>The Funder-Publisher Partnership around the DDIRR program allows researchers to preregister their study, obtain an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>, and obtain funding from the Children’s Tumor Foundation to conduct their proposed experiments. Both CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> maintain a separate and independent review process to align proposed research with both the funder mission as well as to safeguard soundness, accuracy, and scientific rigor. Through this model, before any experiments start, researchers have the opportunity to address reviewer remarks and submit revisions of their protocol until it is ready for publication.</p>



<p>The innovation of this new funding model creates multiple benefits for all participants. Researchers are able to make adjustments to their protocols before they start any lab experiment, funders are ensured that the quality of the proposed research is high quality, and the publisher secures a manuscript that has robust reproducibility in line with the mission and ethos of the journal. In addition, the published manuscript links to the original registered protocol deposited on the Open Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/rr/">portal</a> for full transparency and traceability.</p>



<p>“We are very proud to see the first manuscript of this new award program out, the transparency and the quantity of the protocol adds to the soundness of the research, independent from the nature of the outcome,” said Salvatore La Rosa, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Positive or negative results are equally valuable when a robust protocol is applied, and this model allows for either to emerge.”</p>



<p>“I am delighted that our partnership with the Children’s Tumor Foundation has resulted in the first publication of a preregistered study,” adds Joerg Heber, PLOS Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE. “This scheme ensures the robustness of the research conducted and is a win for openness and transparency in research.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>We are today seeing growing dissatisfaction with the pay-to-publish model for open access. As this requires authors (or their funders or institutions) to pay an article-processing charge every time they publish a paper it is felt to be discriminatory, especially for non-funded researchers and those based in the Global South  (see, for instance, </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/06/plan-s-and-the-global-south-what-do-countries-in-the-global-south-stand-to-gain-from-signing-up-to-europes-open-access-strategy/"><span>here</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-africa-pan-african-2020-10-is-africa-prepared-for-the-business-of-open-access/"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/s7cx4"><span>here</span></a><span>).</span></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/Sarah%2B32.JPEG" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="320" data-original-width="240" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/w150-h200/Sarah%2B32.JPEG" width="150" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">PLOS' Sara Rouhi</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As a result, various alternative approaches are emerging intended to move away from APCs, including crowdfunding and membership schemes. Here institutions are asked to commit to paying an annual fee to a publisher, with the aim of pooling sufficient funds to cover the costs of making all the papers in a journal open access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>One of the more successful implementations of this model is the Open Library of Humanities (</span><a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/"><span>OLH</span></a><span>), which has operated what it calls its </span><a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/"><span>Library Partnership Subsidies</span></a><span> scheme since 2015.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Clearly, if the costs of the annual fee are to be viewed as reasonable by those asked to take part a sufficient number of institutions need to sign up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The inherent weakness of the model is that a small group of community-minded institutions could end up paying all a publisher’s costs and everyone else would be able to “free ride”. In effect, those who join a membership scheme could end up shouldering the costs for everyone to have free access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>A key question is how many universities are willing to join an OA membership scheme. OLH co-founder Martin Eve has </span><a href="https://eve.gd/2020/10/22/backlist-to-the-future-a-new-business-model-for-university-presses-and-open-access-books/"><span>estimated</span></a><span> that there are only around 300 libraries who will do so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Nevertheless, we should not doubt that there is a real wish to move beyond APCs and many have come to believe that membership schemes are the best way of doing this. To be successful, however, they will need to broaden the pool of those willing to take part.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Annual Flat Fee</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>With this aim in mind, in October the Public Library of Science (PLOS) launched what it calls its Community Action Publishing (</span><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/"><span>CAP</span></a><span>) initiative for its two selective journals <i>PLOS Biology</i> and <i>PLOS Medicine</i>. The hope is that the journals can be gradually moved away from having to charge APCs and that the publishing costs can be shared as widely as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Specifically, PLOS is inviting universities to pay an annual flat fee that will give their faculty unlimited publishing opportunities in the journals (there are separate “communities” for each journal) without the need to pay an APC each time. However, authors of institutions who do not join the scheme will be charged a non-member fee (NMF) that will increase in price over time, as below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s437/NMF.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="162" data-original-width="437" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/NMF.png" /></a></div><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The rising cost of the NMF is intended to encourage universities who have not joined to do so in order to avoid their faculty having to pay to publish.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>PLOS hopes that the annual fees will be low enough to attract a sufficient number of institutions but that the pooled funds will eventually be adequate to meet all the costs of publishing the journals. In the interim, the NMF means that there will be two separate revenue streams coming in and the free riding issue will be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The hope is that the NMF can be discontinued when the pilot period ends (it lasts from 2021 until 2023). However, says PLOS Director of Strategic Partnerships Sara Rouhi, that will be dependent on all the large institutions that PLOS is targeting joining the scheme. “If we don’t have a stable membership by then, we might have to offset lack of participation with more NMFs”, she told me. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Tiers</b></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The annual fee institutions will be asked to pay will be calculated by looking at their faculty’s publishing activity between 2014 and Q3 2019. Based on that they will then be assigned to a fee tier, as below.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s412/Tiers.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="289" data-original-width="412" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Tiers.png" /></a></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To help broaden the pool, the annual fee will be calculated on the publishing activity not just of the institution’s corresponding authors, but of their contributing authors too. The aim is to ensure that “the cost of publishing is distributed more equitably among representative institutions.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In other words, PLOS will calculate how often during the historical publishing activity period an institution was associated with both corresponding and contributing authors and then assign a weighting to each type of author. Specifically, contributing-author articles will be weighted at half that of corresponding authors.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As the PLOS FAQ </span><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/"><span>explains</span></a><span>: “Publishing activity is counted by determining the number of times an institution was associated with a corresponding author <i>and</i> the number of times an institution was associated with contributing authors. Papers where the institution is affiliated with the corresponding authors are weighted as 1 article and papers where the institution is affiliated with the contributing author are weighted as ½ article. (Multiple contributing authors from the same institutions are counted only once).”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Universities whose faculty have never published in the journals can also opt to pay the tier’s lowest fee in order to “insure” themselves against the possibility that one or more of their faculty might publish in the journal within the time period of the scheme (Jan 1</span><sup>st</sup><span> 2021 –</span><span>  </span><span>Dec 31</span><sup>st</sup><span>2023).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In addition, says PLOS, Research4Life countries are automatically members of each community so researchers in those countries will never be subject to fees. And authors unable to pay non-member fees can apply for waivers as per the standard fee-waiver mechanisms offered by PLOS.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To signal its own commitment to the community PLOS has set targets for each journal and will cap its margin at 10%. Revenue exceeding the community targets will go back to members at renewal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Time will tell how successful the scheme will be in broadening the pool beyond the 300 libraries who normally join OA membership schemes. Certainly, the challenge will be that much greater given that it is being launched at a time when many libraries are signing expensive <a href="https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/#:~:text=Transformative%20agreements%20are%20those%20contracts%20negotiated%20between%20institutions,fair%20price%20for%20their%20open%20access%20publishing%20services.">transformative agreements</a> with legacy publishers and universities are facing the financial impact of the pandemic. Some have also <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ce-strategy/the-brief-issue-28">suggested</a> that, as selective journals, </span><i>PLOS Biology</i><span> and </span><i>PLOS Medicine</i><span> do not publish a sufficient number of papers to make it worthwhile for many institutions to participate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>My initial thought was that PLOS will be targeting three separate types of institution (corresponding-author institutions, contributing-author institutions, and “insurance” institutions). Sara Rouhi suggests that this is not the way to view it. Below is an exchange I had with her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><b><span style="font-size: large;">Levers</span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: I understand the PLOS Community Action initiative will target 3 types of institution:</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><i><span><br /></span></i></b></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>1.<span>       </span></span></i></b><b><i><span>Corresponding-author institutions.</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 22.5pt;"><b><i><span> </span></i></b></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>2.<span>       </span></span></i></b><b><i><span>Contributing-author institutions.</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">           </p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><b><i><span>3.<span>       </span></span></i></b><b><i><span> </span></i></b><b><i><span>Insurance institutions (those institutions whose researchers don’t currently publish with the PLOS journals but who might want to insure against the possibility that one of their researchers will do in the future).</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>I guess there will be some overlap between 1 and 2 but I assume you will have done some calculations on the numbers of potential institutions for each category.

So rather than think of different types of “institutions,” it’s easier to think of different publishing activity “types” – publishing as a lead author, publishing as a contributing author, or publishing with affiliations in both designations.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Given the selectivity and niche of these journals, some research-intensive universities publish little to not-at-all, and smaller institutions publish more frequently as lead authors. Simplifying the participation criterion to </span><b><i>just</i></b><span>publishing activity elides the traditional distinction of “research intensive” vs. “teaching” institutions etc.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>I don’t want to add further confusion by grouping institutions as you’ve indicated.

There’s some nuance worth flagging, however. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The TL;DR is that Martin’s statement is true if you assume institutions that are participating for largely altruistic reasons – because it’s the “right thing to do.” The PLOS CAP model couldn’t be predicated on that as a buying motivation. So it helps to go back to “collective action” basics. Credit to Dr. Kamran Naim for elucidating this at the Basel Sustainable Publishing Forum last week.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>For collective action schemes to work there are generally two levers you can pull: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>1.<span>       </span></span><span>Encourage “pro-collective” behaviour by leveraging group affinity and social incentives</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 37.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 37.5pt;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">       </p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>2.<span>       </span></span><span>Appeal to economic self-interest (aka “private benefit”)</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>From my perspective, </span><a href="https://scoap3.org/"><span>SCOAP 3</span></a><span> and OLH lean heavily on the first lever. Participating in them is the “right” thing to do so libraries support them.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The challenge with only pulling on this lever is sustainability over time. SCOAP3 relies heavily on CERN’s ongoing support and has the challenge of large beneficiaries like Russia, Brazil and India not participating while benefitting from the open content.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>OLH memberships are very small financial commitments that maintain OLH but make growth of the program difficult. Martin talked about this on a webinar we did for UKSG earlier in the year.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>A collective model that focuses primarily on the second lever is <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785">Subscribe2Open</a>.</span><span> The primary benefit is getting the community to agree to make content open in exchange for a discount. If all members do not opt-in, the content stays behind a paywall. The combination of a private benefit (the discount) with the public good (making the content open) is a strong motivator for participation and a big part of why the model is so successful.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>PLOS Community Action Publishing attempts to pull both levers. The pro-collective/group affinity/social incentives relates to the moral imperative – especially in a time of pandemic – to make biomedical research open to read and open to publish. </span><a href="https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/jeff.kosokoff"><span>Jeff Kosokoff’s</span></a><span> comment that “Open Access <i>is</i> social justice,” speaks to this. Indeed, we have many commitments based on this mission-aligned priority for libraries. However what has interested partners from mere interest to actual commitment is the equitable fee structure (and relative affordability given the current budget crisis).</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>That said, without including appeals to economic self-interest, the PLOS CAP model would suffer from the same sustainability issues as other collectives. Hence our implementation of a secondary, “back up” revenue stream – non-member fees (NMFs) for authors from non-CAP members.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>These NFMs are not meant to penalize authors but rather to encourage libraries to join rather than expose their authors to fees. For many institutions, the NMFs per article will be higher than the annual fee the library would pay to join one or both collectives.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b><span style="font-size: large;">Benefits</span></b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The NMFs help offset slow uptake of institutions who are not able to find the funds to support a model like this immediately. Thanks to those fees coming in, libraries can take more time to join and we can offer flexibility for institutions that need to leave the collective.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>There are several benefits to this:</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Enlarging the pool of institutions that would participate in this collective gives us the flexibility to create a much finer tuned fee structure with a long tail of low dollar fee tiers to accommodate institutions that do not publish frequently in either journal.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Those low fee tiers allow institutions strapped for funds and/or infrequent publishing institutions to participate because they support the moral imperative of equity and inclusivity that the model promotes. It simply doesn’t cost them that much to “do the right thing.”</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Research intensive institutions then derive benefit from the “research light” institutions participating since they offset some of the cost burden. More institutions of varying publishing intensity means lower fees for everyone.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>So, Martin is right if you’re counting only relatively wealthy institutions that want to do the “right thing.” If you start adding other considerations, especially private benefits (aka, we don’t want our authors to see non-member fees) and recognition of contributing author affiliations, you get a much larger pool and set of incentives to motivate ongoing participation.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Targets</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>As for our target institutions:</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>For </span><i>PLOS Medicine</i><span>there are<b> 909 total institutions</b> with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>44 of those are in Tiers 1-4</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>80 are in Tiers 5-7</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>The remainder are in Tiers 8-12</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>For </span><i>PLOS Biology</i><span>there are <b>1,557 total institutions</b> with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>45 are in Tiers 1-5</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><b>152 are in Tiers 6-8</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><b>The remainder are in Tiers 9-12 </b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As I say, I wouldn’t necessarily correlate rough groupings of similar institutions as “corresponding author institutions, contributing author institutions, and insurance institutions” especially since it does not include the thousands of organisations with no publishing history who might want to participate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, it’s probably fair to say that the highest tiers have institutions that published a lot in both designations.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper "Navigation Along Windborne Plumes of Pheromone and Resource-Linked Odors".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many insects locate resources such as a mate, a host, or food by flying upwind along the odor plumes that these resources emit to their source. A windborne plume has a turbulent structure comprised of odor filaments interspersed with clean air. As it propagates downwind, the plume becomes more dispersed and dilute, but filaments with concentrations above the threshold required to elicit a behavioral response from receiving organisms can persist for long distances. Flying insects orient along plumes by steering upwind, triggered by the optomotor reaction. Sequential measurements of differences in odor concentration are unreliable indicators of distance to or direction of the odor source. Plume intermittency and the plume's fine-scale structure can play a role in setting an insect's upwind course. The prowess of insects in navigating to odor sources has spawned bioinspired virtual models and even odor-seeking robots, although some of these approaches use mechanisms that are unnecessarily complex and probably exceed an insect's processing capabilities.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/Blog-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In contemporary society, <a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/whoqol-qualityoflife/en/">quality of life (QoL)</a> is a term used by economists, politicians, and people working across a range of other sectors and fields.  It is a concept used to measure the well-being of a population and societies, with various dimensions that can include material living situation and the environment, as well as subjective perceptions of an individual’s level of contentment with their life.</p>
<p>To healthcare professionals, quality of life has a more specific meaning, and is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/index.htm">Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</a>. HRQoL is an individual’s perception of how they view their general health status which includes physical wellness, emotional well-being, and social functioning. HRQoL is now frequently used in the clinical setting to monitor the quality of healthcare services given to patients, as patients are increasingly recognised as the centre of the healthcare system in today’s era.</p>
<p>A patient’s self-reported HRQoL has been shown to provide a good measure of their overall health status; reflecting their disease burden, mental well-being and social wellness that they experience. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that for patients with various health conditions, their self-report of HRQoL provides a good measure of their future health outcomes. What is less clear however, is whether HRQoL could also be used in the general community population, rather than just patients, to predict an individual’s future health; and thus, to help identify those individuals who are at risk of poorer health outcomes and where active interventions might be required. A systematic review is needed to provide robust evidence to address this question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/what-are-systematic-reviews">A systematic review</a> is important because it provide a comprehensive summary that includes all of the published studies which have investigated a given research question. For this reason, it is considered less prone to bias, including all relevant data rather than selecting data which confirms an existing hypothesis. Therefore, the finding from a clearly defined and robustly conducted systematic review can provide solid evidence which can then be used for developing clinical recommendations and making evidence-based policies. This was the premise for our study.</p>
<p>We undertook the first systematic review to determine whether an individual’s HRQoL was a good predictor of their future risk of dying. Our review included data from 47 studies with a total of approximately 1,200,000 participants living in the community (both with and without existing health conditions). Most participants were aged 65 years and older.</p>
<p>The studies varied in their duration, with some being very short (9 months between when the HRQoL was measured and death was recorded), and others much longer, by following participants for up to 18 years after HRQoL was assessed.</p>
<p>Our study found that individuals who reported poorer HRQoL were more likely to die and in a shorter time. Interestingly, we found that poorer physical HRQoL rather than mental HRQoL was most predictive of their risk of dying during the study.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we suggest that doctors should incorporate a HRQoL questionnaire into an annual screening checklist for individuals attending their clinical practice. This could be used to identify individuals at higher risk for future adverse health outcomes, and who may not otherwise be detected. This practice could in turn enable initiation of active interventions for those individuals at high risk of poorer health outcomes.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do children learn to fear things that aren’t obviously scary, but that do pose a threat — to learn, say, that touching the base of a lit barbecue is a very bad idea, so should never be done? A parent might explain that it’s dangerously hot. But as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74170-1">new paper</a> published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> explores in detail, we also benefit from another more direct, wordless method of learning about threats. Or rather, we may typically benefit from it — but, Marie-France Marin at the University of Quebec and her colleagues argue, it might also help to explain how anxiety disorders are transmitted down through generations.</p>



<span id="more-40758"></span>



<p>Marin and her team set out to explore so-called vicarious learning between 83 child-parent pairs. This entails learning by observing another person’s reactions to objects or events. So if a child sees a parent flinch after touching  a lit barbecue, despite never having experienced that pain themselves, they can learn never to do it. The team wanted to look, though, at how this type of learning might manifest at the physiological level. Fear and anxiety are characterised by an increase in physiological arousal — a raised heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and so on — all of which gear up the individual for fight or flight.</p>



<p>For this study, the team focused on skin conductance as an indicator of general physiological arousal. Each parent was fitted with sensors to measure this, as well as electrodes that were set to deliver an “annoying” rather than painful shock. The parent was then videotaped while they watched, via a monitor, a lamp that flashed various colours. When one particular colour flashed (either red or blue), five times out of eight the parent received a shock. When another colour (yellow) was flashed, a shock was never administered. They learned, then, to associate one particular colour with receiving a shock, and one with being safe.</p>



<p>Each child was shown the video of their own parent’s reactions and also a video of a stranger of the same sex as their parent undergoing the same procedure. (The shocks were associated with a different colour for the stranger and parent: if the parent was shocked when a red light flashed, for instance, the stranger was shocked when the blue light flashed). The child was then put in the same experimental set-up as the adults, except that they were never actually shocked.</p>



<p>The skin conductance data showed that children reacted with alarm to the red and blue lights, but not the yellow light. They had, then, learned to fear the colours associated with a shock to either their parent or a stranger. This suggests that children can learn from any adult, at least to some extent. But the team also found that children who showed greater “physiological synchrony” with their parent — so the child’s shifts in skin conductance levels more closely mirrored those of its parent during the course of the experiment — had stronger alarm reactions when they saw their parent being shocked. This suggests that children who are better “tuned” into their parents’ emotional states vicariously learn fear faster. (Exactly what underpins “better tuning” is not clear, but the quality of the parent/child relationship and the expressiveness of the adult will play a role.)</p>



<p>In the real world, the team notes, “parents transmit a lot of information to their children through their body language and their reactions to environmental stimuli”. If a parent responds appropriately to objects or events in the environment — signalling an appropriate level of fear or pain in response to something that is genuinely dangerous, but not to non-threats — then the child will clearly benefit. However, if the parent has a fear or anxiety disorder and becomes afraid or anxious when there is no genuine threat, their child could then learn these inappropriate responses.</p>



<p>Anxiety disorders often emerge in childhood, with a median age of onset of 11. “Given that [the] risk for anxiety and fear-based disorders is transmitted within families, it is essential to study how children form fearful associations when learning from their parent’s experience,” the researchers stress. Clearly, there’s more work to be done to understand these processes, but this research suggests that the level of physiological synchrony between a child and parent has an influence. This is an area that the team now plans to explore further, in the hope of finding new approaches to preventing or treating anxiety disorders in children.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/04/five-strange-facts-about-dreams/">Five Strange Facts About Dreams</a></h4>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The latest episode of our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/">PsychCrunch podcast</a> explores the blurry boundaries between wakefulness and dreaming. Presenter Ella Rhodes examines that strange transition period between being awake and falling asleep known as hypnagogia. She also learns about maladaptive daydreaming, a condition in which people can lose themselves in their daydreams for hours at a time.</p>



<p>To coincide with the release of the podcast, we’ve examined five strange findings about dreaming from the psychology literature:</p>



<span id="more-40745"></span>



<p><strong>1. Bad dreams are nothing to fear</strong></p>



<p>No one likes a bad dream, but they do serve a purpose: research suggests that they prepare us to better face our fears. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24843">This finding comes from a two-part study</a>. First, participants slept with EEG electrodes fitted to their heads. Several times in the night, they were woken by the researchers, who asked them about the content and emotional tone of any dreams. The team found that the key brain regions that are active when someone is feeling fear are the same whether they are awake or dreaming.</p>



<p>In a follow-up experiment, a fresh group of participants were shown a series of upsetting images, such as pictures of assaults. The more fear they’d experienced during their previous night’s sleep, the less fear they felt in response to these images. Dream fear had, it seems, reined in their fear reactions in waking life. “Dreams may be considered as real training for our future reactions and may potentially prepare us to face real life dangers,” says researcher Lampros Perogamvros at the University of Geneva.</p>



<p><strong>2. You can control your dreams</strong></p>



<p>During a so-called lucid dream, the dreamer realises that they are dreaming and can control what happens. There has been no end of attempts to find ways to induce lucid dreams — mostly unsuccessfully. However, <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/drm0000059">a study at the University of Adelaide, Australia</a>, that explored a few potential techniques found that one was effective. When used in the five minutes immediately before falling asleep, the “MILD” (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams) technique worked 46 % of the time. It consists of simply repeating (to yourself) the phrase: “The next time I’m dreaming, I will remember that I’m dreaming.”</p>



<p><strong>3. People who no longer think can still dream</strong></p>



<p>Auto-activation deficit is a condition, caused by damage to the basal ganglia, in which people not only report having no thoughts, but have lost all self-motivation. They have to be told by carers to do everything from brushing their teeth to eating. However, even though their mind is a blank while they’re awake, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/10/3076/329883">research published by a team in France</a>, shows that some, at least, do still dream. This group was much less likely to experience REM-stage dreams than healthy people, and the dreams they did have were lacking the complexity and emotion that characterises typical dreams. But they did still have some dreams. For example, one patient dreamed of shaving (something he could no longer do by himself), while another dreamed of writing, although, while awake, he never wrote anything without being instructed. </p>



<p>The simplicity of these patients’ dreams (together with the identification of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00187/full">a role for the basal ganglia in integrating information from various brain regions</a>) supports the “bottom-up” theory of dreaming — that dreams are initiated by activity in the brainstem, which is then followed by cortical input, which allows for complex emotional and sensory experiences.</p>



<p><strong>4. Certain drugs can allow you to “dream” while awake</strong></p>



<p>The psychedelic drug DMT (one of the main psychoactive constituents of ayahuasca) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4">produces brain rhythms that look at lot like those observed during dreaming</a>. The team behind this finding reported that, compared with participants who’d received a placebo, the DMT group had much less alpha wave activity (the dominant electrical rhythm while we are awake) and also showed an increase in theta waves, which are associated with dreaming. “From the altered brainwaves and the participants’ reports, it’s clear these people are completely immersed in their experience,” comments lead researcher, Christopher Timmermann at Imperial College, London. “It’s like daydreaming only far more vivid and immersive — it’s like dreaming but with your eyes open.”</p>



<p><strong>5. Some people’s daydreams take over their lives</strong></p>



<p>For some people, their daydreams are so vivid and absorbing that “real life” fades into the background. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/25/people-with-maladaptive-daydreaming-spend-an-average-of-four-hours-a-day-lost-in-their-imagination/">As one sufferer of Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) explains it</a>: “I am careful to control my actions in public so it is not evident that my mind is constantly spinning these stories and I am constantly lost in them.” Although MD does not feature in standard mental health diagnostic manuals, there are online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/">communities </a>dedicated to it. And as the researchers behind a recent study on MD write in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/">their paper</a>, “in recent years it has gradually become evident that daydreaming can evolve into an extreme and maladaptive behaviour, up to the point where it turns into a clinically significant condition.” </p>



<p>In a bid to better understand the mental health factors that accompany MD, Eli Somer at the University of Haifa, Israel and Nirit Soffer-Dudek at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev studied 77 self-diagnosed sufferers. The pair found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms predicted the intensity and duration of maladaptive daydreaming on the following day. However, few participants actually suffered from obsessive compulsive <em>disorder</em>, suggesting that while the two may share some common mechanisms, MD isn’t simply a type of OCD. The next step is to develop strategies to help sufferers control their daydreaming, so that it no longer constitutes a disorder. You can hear Soffer-Dudek talk more about her work in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/">this week’s podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Why do business people promise to “reach out to KOLs” when they could simply say that they will contact leading experts? How come judges sometimes remark that they will hear trials “<em>in-camera</em>” instead of just “in private”?</p>



<p>As infuriating as it can be, jargon actually performs a social function. By definition, jargon refers to language used by a particular group of people, in the place of more accessible words and phrases. And although that can make it frustrating and confusing for people <em>not</em> in that group, if you are a member then it can help signal to others that you belong. People may also use jargon as a way of displaying their expertise.</p>



<p>But according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303666">series of studies</a> published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, those who are of <em>low </em>status within a group are also predisposed towards jargon-filled language. Zachariah Brown at Columbia University and colleagues found that these people appear to want to compensate for their lowly position by using language that is often associated with high status.</p>



<span id="more-40706"></span>



<p>In one study, students doing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) were told that they were taking part in a competition to pitch a start-up idea. They could choose between two different descriptions of the start-up to submit: one which was full of jargon words and phrases (e.g. “obtain a first mover advantage”), and one which used equivalent plain English phrases (e.g. “become one of the first companies to…”).</p>



<p>Some participants were told that their competitors were recent graduates who had already started their own companies — so as MBA students they were of comparatively low status themselves. Others were told that their competitors were undergraduates — so in this case, participants were of higher status. The team found that 41% of the low-status participants went with the jargon-heavy description, compared to just 29% of the high-status participants.</p>



<p>In another study, participants chatted online in pairs. One took the role of an academic researcher presenting their work at a conference. They were given a description of the work, which contained both jargon terms and what they meant in plain English (e.g. “<em>My work highlights that non-human primates exhibit bi-pedal locomotion, or two legged walking movements. They do this on both arboreal and terrestrial substrates (in trees and on the ground).</em>”). In the low-status condition, the “researcher” was told that they worked at a small community college and were looked down upon by others in the field; in the high-status condition they were told they were a well-respected researcher at an Ivy League university.</p>



<p>The other participant in the pair asked the researcher questions about their work; the team were interested in how often the researcher used jargon terms in their response. Once again, low-status researchers used significantly more jargon than high-status ones.</p>



<p>To figure out <em>why </em>low-status participants tended to use more jargon, the team asked another set of participants to again imagine themselves as either a high- or low-status researcher, and choose one of two titles for a presentation — as well as indicate why they made their decision. Low-status participants were again more likely to choose the option containing jargon. They also reported focusing more on how the audience would judge them, and this could explain why they chose the jargon option.</p>



<p>Overall then, the work suggests that jargon use is “a novel form of status compensation”, allowing people to make up for their low status through their language choices. It’s obviously not the <em>only</em> reason that people use jargon, but is one that hadn’t previously been considered.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to look at language used naturally by high- and low-status group members outside of the lab, to figure out the extent to which this effect applies in day-to-day interactions. (The team did find that thesis titles from higher ranked universities used less jargon, providing some preliminary evidence that it does apply more widely, but more work is needed). And there’s still one big question left to answer: does jargon actually work to convince people that you are a higher-status group member — or does the audience just see through it?</p>

<p>Open Access Week returned this year, bringing back themes of equity and inclusivity to the forefront of the community once again, as it has done in the past. </p>



<p>This OA week PLOS coordinated and participated in a mix of activities to illustrate the positive impacts Open Access can have on the scientific community and explored strategies to ensure that Open Access truly is open for everyone.<br /><br /><strong>Open Access Week 2020 with the Drexel Libraries</strong><br /><br />On October 20, Emily Chenette, <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief was a  virtual speaker at Drexel Libraries’, <a href="https://libcal.library.drexel.edu/event/7210114"><em>How Open Access Supports ‘Good Science’</em></a>. In this session, Emily explored questions such as: <em>what comes to mind when you think about good science? Is it reproducible? Impactful? Accessible? </em></p>



<p>The discussion delved into what we mean when we talk about good science, and how Open Access supports the practice and publication of it. She also discussed the steps PLOS takes to ensure that published papers are open and accessible, reproducible, conducted ethically, and contribute to the base of academic knowledge.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Voices and opinions of OA advocates</strong><br /><br />Throughout this year’s OA Week we saw a great number of people stand up and take part in a collection of online activities to share their thoughts in support of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>One of the great things about OA Week is hearing from the community with their thoughts and opinions on what matters to them most. A lot of those people took part in our daily polls: </p>

<p><br />People also <a href="https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319288985231872006">tweeted</a> their support and promoted the many benefits of OA, from international collaboration to the advantages of Open Data.<br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</strong><br /><br />This OA Week we took the time to reflect on the importance of research accessibility and the many benefits of Open Access in our blog post, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/building-equity-and-inclusivity-in-science/"><em>Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</em></a>. Don’t miss it! </p>



<p>PLOS’ entire ethos is built on the idea of research being open to a global community, however, we know there’s still plenty of work for us to do to make things better for researchers across the world. In this post we highlight the benefits of OA and what PLOS can do to make our journals more inclusive, equitable and diverse for the scientific community as a whole.<br /><br /><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">Read more on our plans for a more inclusive future.</a><br /><strong><br />What’s next?</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>We will continue to make PLOS an increasingly more inclusive, transparent and diverse platform for researchers across the globe to showcase their crucial findings. A part of this work has already started as we aim to bridge the gap between researchers and Open Access with the introduction of our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> initiative and our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">institutional partnerships</a>. Together with our latest message on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">price transparency</a> we hope our latest opportunities and resources will help researchers open their research and trust in science. </p>

From Google's English:  "Society needs humanistic knowledge. The humanities need to reach out to society. Therefore, for the sixth year in a row, the think tank Humtank awards the Humtank Prize to academics or institutions that have made a meritorious contribution to important humanities perspectives in society. This year's winner is the Royal Library, and this is the motivation:

 

The Royal Library (KB) has, by opening up its entire digitized newspaper archive on the internet during the corona pandemic, paved the way into the future. In a time marked by copyright and commercial tunnel events, KB gave everyone the opportunity to explore almost 400 years of Swedish news reporting and history - regardless of where they are in the country. A temporary copyright agreement meant that the entire archive could only be accessed freely for a few months, but through the initiative, the library has opened a wide window, which no researcher or good citizen wants to see closed anymore. In a far-sighted and meritorious way, KB has thus shown a genuinely digitized future, where history is free and accessible for everyone to explore."

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>In the UK, the clocks went back last weekend and we’re now faced with dark, gloomy evenings. </strong>But around the world, many countries have decided that the time has come to abolish clock changes. And there are good reasons for doing so, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/governments-worldwide-consider-ditching-daylight-saving-time/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29">Beth Malow tells Diana Kwon at <em>Scientific American</em></a>: changing the clocks throws our circadian rhythms out, which can affect our sleep and stress response</p>

<p><strong>People who generally do more “media multitasking” — using social media while watching TV, for instance — showed more lapses of attention during a recall task in a recent study,</strong> <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/media-multitasking-memory-neuroscience/">reports Kat Eschner</a> at <em>Popular Science. </em>The results suggest that media multitasking could be related to poorer concentration and memory — but as the story notes, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the direction of causality, as well as the suitability of the measures used in this kind of work.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>There is a relatively rare subtype of dementia called “autoimmune dementia”, caused by antibodies binding to brain tissue. </strong>It may often be misdiagnosed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/25/the-dementia-that-can-be-cured">writes David Cox at <em>The Observer</em></a> — but the good news is that, once identified, it is treatable.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>A study of UK MPs and councillors reveals the extent to which politicians have to engage in “emotional labour”,</strong> <a href="https://theconversation.com/burn-out-the-emotional-toll-of-being-a-politician-revealed-146323">writes researcher James Weinberg</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. For instance, the majority of those surveyed said that they frequently had to be artificially friendly or act nice to others, no matter how they were treated themselves. Consistent with findings from other professions, women seemed to end up taking on more of this emotional labour than men.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>A new tool for studying the human brain has recently been added to the neuroscientist’s toolbox: brain organoids, rudimentary brain-like structures grown in the lab from stem cells</strong>. But the use of these “mini-brains” also brings up tricky ethical issues. At <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02986-y">Sara Reardon asks</a> at what point a collection of brain cells becomes conscious.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>Meanwhile, optogenetics, in which neurons can be activated using light, continues to produce scientific insights — in rodents, at least. </strong>It’s been much more challenging to use the technique in primate studies, however, which are an important step towards developing optogenetics-based therapies for humans. But researchers hope a new open data initiative will help, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/controlling-monkey-brains-light-could-get-easier-thanks-open-data-project">writes Kelly Servick</a> at <em>Science</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>One last interesting neuroscience study from this week: scientists have created a brain-computer interface by attaching electrodes onto a stent, which they then threaded into a blood vessel in the brain. </strong>The technology enabled patients with paralysis to click a cursor on a computer, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-way-to-plug-a-human-brain-into-a-computer-via-veins/">reports Adam Rogers</a> at <em>Wired,</em> allowing them to text and shop online.</p>

Awareness of death or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_salience">mortality salience</a> —  pondering the inevitability of your own death, a time when you will no longer exist — triggers anxiety, according the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260115000052" target="_blank">Terror Management Theory</a> (TMT). In response to this threat, humans react in ways to boost their self-esteem and reinforce their own values (and punish outsiders). These cognitive processes are conceptualized as nebulous “defenses”  [<i>nebulous to me, at least</i>] that are deployed to minimize terror. Notably, however, experimental manipulation of mortality salience did <b><i>not</i></b> affect “worldview defense” in the large-scale <a href="https://www.cos.io/blog/many-labs-4-failure-replicate-mortality-salience-effect-and-without-original-author-involvement" target="_blank">Many Labs 4</a> replication project, which throws cold water on this aspect of TMT.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Predictive Coding and Perceived Risk of COVID-19</b><br /></p><p>An alternative view of how we disassociate ourselves from death awareness is provided by predictive coding theory.

They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. </blockquote><p>Prediction errors are minimized by perceptual inference (updating predictions to better match the input) or active inference (sampling the input in a biased fashion to better ﬁt the predictions). A recent paper considered this framework with regard to beliefs generated during the pandemic, and how they're related to health precautions adopted by individuals to mitigate spread of the virus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242918/" target="_blank">Bottemanne et al, 2020</a>).

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/30/october-2020-highlights/">October 2020 Highlights</a></h4>

<p>The arXiv team has been busy this month! Here’s a recap.</p>
<p>Authors can now submit their work using <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/24/tex-live-2020-release-oct-1-2020/"><strong>TeXLive 2020</strong></a>, the most recent version of the TeX open source markup language that enables precision formatting for academic writing. The rollout was seamless, with zero interruptions in service. TeXLive 2020 — and, psst, an upcoming TeX log error highlighting feature — make submission smoother for authors.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="arXivLabs logo" class="alignright wp-image-682 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-150x150.png" width="150" /><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a></strong> – a new framework for collaboration – was launched. Plus, exciting new functionality was released in the arXivLabs tabs section of the abstract record page. Based on user feedback, it’s fabs. Code can now be linked to articles, thanks to the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">Papers with Code</a> collaboration.  Readers can also now easily check out articles that match their interest when they activate the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/15/core-recommender-now-supports-article-discovery-on-arxiv/">CORE Recommender</a>. Community collaboration and cutting-edge features are important to authors and readers – which means they’re important to the arXiv team too.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/"><strong>new classifier</strong></a> was integrated into the submission system. This helps place papers in the right category, which is critical to helping research reach the right audience. The author experience didn’t change with this upgrade, but – bonus! – this classifier code is totally transparent and publicly available so that others can build up on it.</p>

This event also kicked off <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/">Giving Week</a>, arXiv’s first community fundraiser since the pandemic began. We were heartened to receive nearly 1400 individual donations, ranging from $5 to $1000. Each and every gift helps ensure that arXiv remains a non-commercial, community resource. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>Last, and certainly not least, arXiv hosted its very first <strong>virtual board meeting</strong>, where members of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Member Advisory Board</a> gathered to hear about updates, plans, challenges and opportunities — and provide their valuable insights. The meeting was intense and fruitful, with discussions ranging from big picture strategy to daily operations like moderator recruitment. Some of our board members have volunteered in this capacity for more than a decade, and we’re grateful that they continually inspire the staff to serve authors, readers, and open science. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/xcSDQxO7WxU/">PLOS Update</a></h4>

<p>Over four years ago we launched PLOS Channels to highlight research and news relevant to our research communities. Eventually, the portfolio grew to include 13 Channels in topics from stem cells to tuberculosis to cholera (see the full list below). New content was added to Channels by expert Channel Editors, who selected articles to include in a journal- and publisher-agnostic manner. Channels were initially conceived as a meaningful space to serve a variety of communities beyond typical journal boundaries and challenge the assessment of impact and importance of research.  </p>



<p>Today, we are announcing that we have made the difficult decision to stop updating the Channels. Despite positive feedback from some authors and their institutions, we have not seen the usage from the community that would allow us to achieve our goals. Moreover, we were not able to scale the program to meet everyone’s needs, and we suspect that post-publication curation of content may be best done by a neutral third party, rather than an organisation like PLOS, which publishes some of the content included in the Channels. </p>



<p>The content in all Channels will be archived and will remain available online. The following two Channels will migrate to PLOS Curated Collections, where they will continue to be updated with relevant research from PLOS to connect people to content and inspire collaboration:</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc">  Veterans Disability &amp; Rehabilitation Research</a>: to maintain our commitment to the Veteran’s Administration</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs">  Disease Forecasting &amp; Surveillance</a>: because the current pandemic demonstrates the essential nature of this content, and its curation. This Channel will be renamed to Infectious Disease Epidemiology to ensure that all relevant content on this important topic is included.</p>



<p>PLOS would not exist without the people who believe in our mission and values, and who help us with  projects like Channels. We rely on scientists like our Channel Editors to keep pushing us on our collective journey to make science more open, accessible and transparent.</p>



<p>On behalf of everyone at PLOS, we want to thank all our Channel Editors and Administrators (past &amp; present) for their tireless work and dedication and all of the loyal subscribers who have followed PLOS Channels over the years. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have truly enriched our organization and science as a whole.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are some curious cultural ideas around sleep, namely that there’s something virtuous or impressive about not getting very much of it. “Burnout” is often shorthand for success: if you’re successful it follows that you’re also pretty busy, in which case you’re less likely to get enough sleep. Margaret Thatcher famously boasted that she only needed to sleep four hours a night, as has Donald Trump — though whether that bolsters or damages the prestige associated with sleepless nights probably depends on your politics.</p>



<p>There may also be links between sleep and perceptions of masculinity, a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711758">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of the Association for Consumer Research</em> suggests. In a number of studies, Nathan B. Warren and Troy H. Campbell from the University of Oregon found that not only do we associate sleep deprivation with masculinity, but that men who sleep less actually experience more favourable social judgements than their better-rested counterparts.</p>



<span id="more-40666"></span>



<p>In the first study, 144 participants were asked to imagine a man shopping for a bed; when approached by a salesperson, the man is asked how much he sleeps. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: in one, the man answers that he sleeps a lot, while in the other he states that he sleeps very little. After hearing the man’s answer, participants rated how masculine they felt he was — and when participants heard that he had lots of sleep, masculinity ratings were significantly lower than in the little sleep condition.</p>



<p>Next, participants were asked to describe either a masculine or non-masculine man’s habits and behaviours: what he would like to do for fun, for example, as well as how much sleep he would get on average. As in the first study, there was a link: those in the masculine condition described their character sleeping for 33 minutes less than the non-masculine character.</p>



<p>The team then explored <em>why</em> men who sleep less are seen as less masculine. They asked 207 participants to describe a man who either gets “lots of sleep” or “little sleep”, rating his character on seven measures of agency (e.g. “he is individualistic” or “he is assertive”).</p>



<p>Again, participants rated men who sleep a lot as significantly less masculine than those who sleep a little. But participants’ perceptions of agency seemed to be key to this link: characters who sleep a lot were described as having less agency than those who sleep a little, and this in turn led people to rate those characters as less masculine.</p>



<p>A later study looked at social judgements: are men who sleep more judged more harshly than those who sleep less? Participants were asked how American society would judge various people (e.g. “athletes” and “adult males”) if they either slept  “a lot” or ”very little”.</p>



<p>As predicted, men who sleep a lot were evaluated more negatively than those who sleep a little, while there was no difference for women. Interestingly, judgements across other categories were uneven — athletes were positively evaluated when they slept a lot, whilst lawyers were more favourably looked upon when they slept a little. A subsequent study again showed that perceptions of agency and masculinity were important when making these social judgments. </p>



<p>Finally, the team found that even self-evaluations were influenced by stereotypes about sleep and masculinity. Men who imagined telling another person that they slept more than average felt significantly less masculine than those who imagined saying they slept less than average.</p>



<p>The key factor in understanding why there is such a strong link between sleep and perceived masculinity, the team argues, is <em>agency.</em> Many facets of agency are considered to be stereotypically masculine — assertiveness, individualism, orientation towards goals — compared to the more “feminine” traits of empathy or affection. If you’re goal-oriented and assertive, you’re likely to be someone who strives to use their time efficiently — which is where the perceived link between success, sleep and masculinity might come into play.</p>



<p>For those who aren’t particularly interested in abiding by gender stereotypes or reject them altogether, the results probably don’t make much difference. But if men are sleeping less because of worries around masculinity, they could face some seriously negative consequences:  physical or mental health issues have often been linked to poor sleep. Challenging stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, as in so many other areas, may prove beneficial when it comes to persuading men it’s alright to have a good night’s sleep.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kucfd8ARAo8/">How do researchers evaluate research?</a></h4>

<p>PLOS has received a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/">Alfred</a><a href="https://sloan.org/"> P. Sloan Foundation</a> to study how researchers evaluate both the <strong>credibility </strong>and <strong>impact </strong>of research outputs (e.g. articles, preprints, data, and code). We will be conducting this research in partnership with the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/">American Society for Cell Biology</a><strong> </strong>(ASCB).</p>



<p>We’ll be looking at this in two contexts: (1) when researchers are <em>discovering </em>and <em>reading </em>these outputs in the process of their own research, and (2) when they are <em>assessing </em>these outputs while participating in grant application review panels and hiring committees.</p>



<p>We are interested in characterizing the steps that researchers go through to form judgments of both credibility and impact in these two contexts.</p>



<h3>Why is this new research needed?</h3>



<p>Previous research has explored the factors that influence trust and how researchers decide which articles to read and cite, showing that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-140725">personal inspection</a>, social clues, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206">peer review</a>, are important. Recently, preprints have created new challenges for researchers who evaluate large amounts of new information outside of the traditional framework of journal peer review. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux">survey by the Center for Open Science</a> suggested that cues related to Open Science content (e.g. signaling open availability of data) and independent verification are important for judging credibility of preprints.</p>



<p>Yet, the current system for assessing research is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914">dominated by signifiers of </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914"><strong>impact</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Since impact cannot be known until after time has passed, various proxies have been used that signal perceived, or the potential for, impact such as publication in a high Impact Factor journal.</p>



<p>PLOS and other organizations, in particular the multi-stakeholder organization <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA, </a>have stressed the negative consequences of such a narrow focus on proxies of impact and the need for reform. Most problematically, researchers are pushed to place a higher priority on pursuing these proxies than on making their research <strong>credible</strong>, <strong>reproducible, </strong>and <strong>reusable.</strong></p>



<p>Many have suggested that this focus on proxies for impact in research assessment is at least in part due to the <strong>practical limitations in evaluating credibility and impact</strong>. By understanding what truly matters to researchers in forming these judgments, we hope to find insights that can inform better practice in research assessment, inspire better tools for researchers, and help us evolve how we signal the markers of credibility in the articles we publish.</p>



<h3>Collaboration with ASCB</h3>



<p>We are not undertaking this project alone! We are excited to be conducting this research in collaboration with the ASCB. This partnership helps maximize the connection of this project to the research community. As the organizational sponsor of DORA, ASCB is also a scientific association demonstrably dedicated to advocating sound research policies and improving research culture.</p>



<h3>What comes after the research?</h3>



<p>We will publish a report on the insights obtained through this research. This report will have a CC BY license, with anonymized and aggregated data.</p>



<p>Future research might include a quantitative initiative to validate the findings with a broader group of researchers. Ultimately, we would like to understand if there are opportunities to better serve researchers’ needs to assess and discover new research than currently available methods. Therefore, we also hope that our initial report will prompt further research by others, which we believe is important for the research and scholarly communication communities. We are very thankful to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for their interest in this research project and dedicated support of <a href="https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/scholarly-communication">Scholarly Communication</a> issues in general.</p>



<p>We are confident that improvements to research assessment culture and practice are possible. And we also believe that there is no more important a moment to be doing this, as we experience a global crisis during which unbiased, rigorous, and credible research will play an unprecedented role.</p>

They are even beginning to drive our cars. Another role that they are tipped to take over is negotiating on our behalf to sell a car, say, or resolve a legal dispute.</p>



<p>So, reasoned Jonathan Mell and colleagues at the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, it’s important to know whether using a bot might affect how we negotiate —and it turns out that it does. One of the most striking findings from the team’s series of studies is that less experienced negotiators are more willing to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them. The studies also illuminate how our stance on various negotiating tactics alters through experience — information that would be needed to program negotiating bots to accurately represent us.</p>


<p><span id="more-40649"></span></p>


<p>In the first online study, 741 participants were asked about their experience in negotiating for good deals or prices. Then they were told to imagine that they were negotiating for something important to them, such as a house or a car. Next, they were told either that they would negotiate for themselves, or they would program a bot to do the job for them. They all then completed the team’s new Agent Negotiation Tactics Inventory (ANTI), indicating just how tough, deceptive and pleasant or otherwise they wanted to be (in the case of the first group) or wanted their bot to be.</p>



<p>For example, they could endorse making an opening demand far greater than that they’d be willing to settle for (a “tough” stance) and/or convey a “positive disposition” or express sympathy with the opponent’s plight (and so come across as pleasant). But they could also indicate that they — or their agent — would “strategically express anger toward the opponent to extract concessions” or “convey dissatisfaction with the encounter so that the other party will think he/she is losing interest”. These are both examples of deceptive strategies. The team found that participants who thought about programming the agent to negotiate on their behalf endorsed deceptive tactics more than those thinking about negotiating for themselves.</p>



<p>The second online study found that more negative previous negotiation experiences (arguing over a deal, for example) were linked to a greater willingness to use deceptive tactics across the board. For the final study, again run online, 190 participants completed the ANTI then engaged in a 10-minute negotiation using an online platform in which “players” must negotiate (using pre-written phrases, questions, statements and also emotion buttons) to split a number of items between them. Each player is told how much each item is worth to them, but they don’t know how much it’s worth to their opponent. In this study, each participant in fact went up against a bot, rather than a human player.  The bots had one of four different negotiating profiles: nice plus competitive, nice plus consensus-building, nasty plus competitive and nasty plus consensus-building. None, however, used any deceptive tactics.</p>



<p>At the end of the negotiation, the participants filled out the ANTI again, to indicate how they would behave next time. The team found that whether the agent was nice or nasty didn’t change the ANTI ratings. However, while interacting with a competitive “tough” agent increased endorsement of deceptive tactics, interacting with a “fair” consensus-building agent reduced intentions to be deceptive. Though the agents had not used deception, even brief experience with a hard-ball negotiator bot made the participants more willing to be underhand. As the researchers write, even if participants are initially keen for their representative to negotiate fairly, “exposure to the real world of aggressive, tough negotiators is enough make them forsake their qualms and embrace deception”.</p>



<p>When designing future agents to accurately represent us in real-world negotiations, these findings should, then, be taken into account, the researchers say — the work suggests that bots should be programmed to become more deceptive in response to a tough negotiation. As the team writes, “Shying away from this during agent design could lead to unsatisfied users and would have severe implications for the adoption of future agent representative systems.”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">History was made this year when two women, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a genome editing method using CRISPR-Cas9, which has numerous applications in the editing of plant and animal genomes. However, even before the discovery of CRISPR-Cas’ use in DNA editing, the use of genome editing techniques in humans has long been considered unethical, with many countries making it illegal to edit human embryos. In 2018, the highly-controversial birth of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">‘CRISPR babies’</a> – twin girls allegedly born with CRISPR-edited genomes – shocked the world and renewed discussions about the ethics and legality of such practices.</p>
<p>Using cystic fibrosis scenarios as functional examples, Schleidgen <em>et al. </em>explore three consistently-debated issues of human germline therapies in relation to CRISPR-Cas: the risks of using the tool in human germline editing, what responsibilities future generations bear and whether the treatment is legitimate.</p>
<p>The authors argue that categorically prohibiting the use of CRISPR-Cas ‘one-generation germline therapies’ – which would theoretically phenotypically cure the developing embryo, but ensure that the changes are not passed onto offspring – would not be legally or ethically justifiable, provided that concepts surrounding human germline editing are clarified.</p>

<p>There are currently no unified guidelines to help individual healthcare professionals (and medical students) assess bias across different study types, an essential skill in the practice of evidence-based medicine. Study type-specific tools do currently exist, such as those that aid in the assessment of bias in observational studies, but can’t be reliably applied to other study types, such as randomized trials.</p>
<p>Luijendijk <em>et al.</em> have identified this gap and also argue that current frameworks are limited in requiring only methodological knowledge to detect bias, as some study aspects may only be appraised using subject-matter knowledge. In order to generate a unified framework, they applied a popular conceptual framework typically used only in observational studies to randomized trials, by defining the research question in terms of study population, intervention and outcome, and using causal diagrams to illustrate how each source of bias can lead to over- or under-estimations of treatment effects. The developed framework allows for the identification of three sources of bias independent of study design: bias due to a common cause, bias due to systematic measurement error, and bias due to a common effect.</p>

<p>The human gut is colonized by many commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which constitute part of the gut microbiome. Since it was established that the composition of the human gut microbiome can have major impacts on our health, the field of research has rapidly grown; in the last 40 years,<a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/9/1716?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"> 80% of human gut microbiome research was published between 2013 and 2017.</a> <em>Bifidobacteria</em> are relatively abundant in the human gut, and attract particular interest due to their potential for use as probiotics (live bacteria that are considered to be good for health) and as targets of prebiotics (substances that increase the abundance or activity of existing bacteria).</p>
<p>In their study, Chung <em>et al.</em> investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of AXOS (arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, which have been demonstrated to promote the abundance of <em>Bifidobacteria</em>) on gut microbiota. They carried out a crossover, randomised, double-blind trial whereby the diets of elderly volunteers were supplemented with AXOS or maltodextrin, and their effects on faecal bacteria and blood serum parameters were measured.</p>
<p>The faecal samples analysed revealed an increase in <em>Bifidobacteria </em>observed across the entire cohort in response to AXOS supplementation, independent of the observed inter-individual variation in gut microbiota. However, variation in the levels of baseline <em>Prevotella</em> species of gut bacteria did determine how responsive each patient was to AXOS supplementation. The authors conclude that AXOS supplementation is bifidogenic, suggesting that AXOS may be considered a viable prebiotic option in the elderly, and due to the influence of existing gut bacteria on the bifidogenic response, call for the consideration of microbiota profiling when testing the efficacy of prebiotics.</p>

<p>Conventional cigarette smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse effects on both mother and baby health, and is amongst one of the leading preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. The difficulties of quitting smoking during pregnancy have led many to consider alternatives to conventional cigarettes, such as electronic or ‘e’ cigarettes. As they contain fewer toxic chemicals than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are largely believed to have fewer adverse health effects compared to traditional cigarettes, but there is little evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Authors Sooyong Kim and Sanda Cristina Oancea sought to determine whether e-cigarettes are safer in pregnancy than conventional cigarettes, by extracting and analysing data from the PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) study cohort, a large study that included data on 55,000 pregnancies. Participants were classified into three groups: complete tobacco abstinence, exclusive conventional cigarette use, and exclusive e-cigarette use, and adverse birth outcomes were defined as low birth weight, preterm birth and ‘small for gestational age’. They found that, when compared to conventional cigarette users, the risk of each adverse birth outcome was not significantly reduced, and e-cigarettes cannot be considered to be safer than conventional cigarettes. Following this, the authors encourage the complete abstinence from all tobacco products during pregnancy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/r-sIMq0e_IE/">Author Interview: Luca Morgantini on Burnout among Healthcare Professionals in COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Dr. Luca Morgantini worked with a diverse group of researchers to survey healthcare professionals across the globe to study the degree of burnout they were experiencing. For their <em>PLOS ONE</em> article, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238217">Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey</a>, they surveyed 2,700 individuals across 60 countries in April 2020 and found that burnout had generally increased compared to pre-pandemic times. I asked Luca on whether there were any surprises he came across during this study, the scientific communities’ response to the crisis and more. </p>



<p><strong><em>This paper seems outside the scope of your usual work. How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I decided to document the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers the moment I saw non-medical parts of our society downplay what was happening in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was starting to spread in Europe and North America. This research is important because we gathered data during the height of the pandemic, providing solid foundations for future healthcare policies while avoiding recall biases.</p>



<p>It was evident from the reports of my Chinese friends and colleagues how serious was this disease, with Wuhan going on lockdown in late January. I observed how the infection slowly spread to the rest of the world hitting Italy, my home country, particularly hard. I completed my medical training in Milan, where my colleagues found themselves working in the red zone without adequate protection or directives from their supervisors. Soon the pandemic reached the United States, where I am currently living. While study is outside my usual scope of work, as a healthcare professional and researcher I felt the need to play my part in the fight against COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong><em>I note that you originally uploaded the manuscript to MedRxiv as a preprint. At what time in your career did you start thinking about Open Science, and why is it important to you?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I believe that Open Science is essential for a fair and accessible future of science. Paywalls and other accessibility restrictions disproportionally affect early-career investigators or individuals with less economic means. I have been personally impacted by these paywalls, as institutions often cannot offer a subscription to all the countless scientific publishers. I understand there is a delicate balance between accessibility and profit, but I am convinced that other business models are feasible.</p>



<p>My team chose to publish a preprint on MedRxiv and then published our article on <em>PLOS ONE</em>, because one of the purposes of our research is to make all our collected data freely available for other researchers.</p>



<p><strong><em>You additionally opted to publish your peer review history with your publication. What led you to this decision and how important do you think transparency of the review process is?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: We decided to publish the peer review history for two reasons. First, we believe this is a way to recognize the tremendous work done by the Editor and the Reviewers. They significantly contributed to the relevance of our manuscript by providing constructive comments, and we want to acknowledge their role in our publication by making their comments public.</p>



<p>Second, we believe in the importance of a transparent review process. This will allow other researchers investigating this field to understand what the concerns of the reviewers were.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you consider this research interdisciplinary? If so, how crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of this type of research?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Burnout is a complex phenomenon and an interdisciplinary approach allowed our team to evaluate it from different perspectives. My co-authors have different backgrounds in urology, psychiatry, biostatistics and epidemiology research. The heterogeneity of our team was essential in creating a short but comprehensive questionnaire.</p>



<p>An interdisciplinary team of reviewers is important for the same reasons. Analyzing such complex arguments from different points of view is required to better assess the eventual limitations of each study.</p>



<p><strong><em>Were you particularly surprised by anything your study uncovered or were the results generally what you expected?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: To be honest, we were simply amazed by the number of healthcare professionals that participated in our study. I feel that they appreciated our process because we were as inclusive as possible, considering parts of the healthcare workforce and geographical areas that are often overlooked in healthcare research. From the comments we received, we noticed how they appreciated our effort to study their quality of work and life, and their willingness to make their COVID-19 experiences count.</p>



<p>One of the most surprising results was the selflessness and dedication of healthcare workers: the vast majority is willing to continue working despite the obvious risk. Their main concern is not infecting themselves, but bringing the virus home to friends and loved ones. These results were consistent across all countries, genders, and healthcare professions.</p>



<p><strong><em>In your Conclusion, you mention a few actions that could potentially mitigate burnout for healthcare professionals. Are there any that you would particularly like to see pursued by institutions and other stakeholders?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: It is evident how our society and healthcare systems were not ready to withstand the first wave of a global pandemic. When the Spanish flu infected an estimated half a billion individuals around a century ago, the scientific community was only starting to understand what viruses are and how pandemics evolve. COVID-19 is the first true global pandemic where modern science can play an active and aware role. This is an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to document and understand how to improve the condition of frontline healthcare workers. The manuscript we published represents only one of the hundreds of studies that are being conducted on this topic that all together will contribute to mitigating the negative effects of future pandemics.</p>



<p>In particular, we observed how training was mostly reported to be ineffective and how adequate protective equipment was rarely available. We understood how healthcare workers are more concerned about their families than themselves, and future policies that would assure the safety of their loved ones, such as periodical testing, kindergartens, or short term rentals close to hospitals, would greatly improve their quality of life.</p>



<p><strong><em>What have you seen from peers and the scientific community as a whole during the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is performing an extraordinary and unprecedented synergic effort towards improving diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. I felt this willingness to help and collaborate while conducting this research, where I received tremendous support from my institution, colleagues, and expert researchers. The lessons learned during these difficult times will greatly help our scientific community and will help build a collaborative and constructive future. I am grateful to be part of this collective scientific effort that is one of the positive lessons to be learnt from this pandemic.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr. Michio Murakami, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, speaks on the significance of Luca’s work and the need to work through differences to improve our world. </em></p>



<p>MM: Among the many published COVID-19-related papers, the paper by Morgantini et al. is particularly significant. First, they conducted a rapid survey of 60 countries, highlighting that burnout of healthcare professionals is an important issue around the world. Second, it points out the importance of training and organizational support as a solution to address burnout. Ultimately, the paper points out an issue that is shared globally and presents findings that can lead to solutions.</p>



<p>COVID-19 and the associated social response pose a diverse range of physical and socio-psychological health problems. Some of these issues relate to discrimination, prejudice and social division. Different values and cultural worldviews, depending on the identity and position of individuals and groups, may lead to different opinions and social division. We need to be respectful of our values to individuals and different groups, and increase awareness of the fact that society is built on mutual reciprocity. There are shared goals and a vision of the world we can aspire to, even though our values may differ.</p>



<p>Needless to say, there are many aspects of our health that is supported by healthcare professionals, and none of us want a world in which many healthcare professionals leave their work. This paper by Morgantini et al. provides useful insights on this global issues that should be addressed and encourages further discussion about the vision of the world we aspire to.</p>



<p><em>I extend my gratitude to both Luca and Michio for providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers. </em></p>

<p class="">The auditory cortex is found in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus" target="_blank">lateral sulcus</a>. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus" target="_blank">superior temporal gyrus</a>.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the <em>core</em> region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.</p><p class="">The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri" target="_blank">Heschl’s gyri</a> (aka the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri" target="_blank">transverse temporal gyri</a>). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus" target="_blank">sulcus</a> (or beyond).</p><p class="">The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the <em>belt</em> region, and surrounding that is an area often called the <em>parabelt </em>region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus" target="_blank">medial geniculate nucleus</a>, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a <em>tonotopic</em> map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (<em>Frequency</em>, when referring to sound waves, is related to <em>pitch</em>. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) </p><p class="">The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlea</a>, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">primary somatosensory cortex</a> contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).</p><p class="">There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.</p><p class="">Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.</p><p class="">Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__items">
<div class="field__item">
<p>Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.</p>
<p>Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.</p>
<p>“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”</a></p>
<p>“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”</p>
<p>The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_749" style="width: 270px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;t"><img alt="image of arXiv Video Screenshot" class="wp-image-749 size-full" height="182" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png" width="270" /></a>To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.</figure>
<p>With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.</p>
<p>In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.</p>
<p>At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.</p>
<p>“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”</p>
<p>The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.</p>
<p>“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”</p>
<p>Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.</p>
<p>“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.</p>
<p>When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.</p>
<p>“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/people-3755342_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Contact tracing for disease control</strong></p>
<p>Syphilis and gonorrhea incidence <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report.html">have increased enormously</a> in recent decades, necessitating innovative approaches. The rising prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea, together with the increase in prevalence of resistant gonorrhea, makes contact tracing an important tool for disease control. In connection with the opioid epidemic, syphilis is now common in rural areas. However, people infected with stigmatized diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea may be reluctant to reveal all of their sexual contacts. Reasons for not revealing all contacts may include internalized stigma, cognitive dissonance, or beliefs that certain types of sexual contacts do not “count.”</p>
<p>Asking for friends might identify more sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases because friends may participate within the same sexual network, or some friends might be non-romantic sexual partners. One survey even found 77% of Grindr users report looking for friendship, more than the percentage seeking dating (67%), one-on-one sex (62%), or group sex (17%).<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09589-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><strong>Our study</strong></a></p>
<p>Patients who were diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea in Baltimore City STI clinics were asked to name the most important people in their lives, with questions such as whom they eat meals with, who would take them to medical appointments, who would go to the store for them, or lend them $25. After patients named their friends and social contacts, they were asked to name their sexual contacts. Both social and sexual contacts were invited to the STI clinic for testing, and to name their own social and sexual contacts.</p>
<p>Using this information for patients whose contacts visited the STI clinic, we created a network showing the friendship and sexual contacts and the STI test results.  We identified new cases of both syphilis and gonorrhea within each network.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12132" style="width: 307px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12132 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-1-297x300.jpg" width="297" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1</div><div class="attachment-image--source">New cases of syphilis</div></figure>
<p>In Figure 1, the network shows new cases of syphilis identified by asking for social contacts in the large red squares.The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for syphilis. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections. Biological strain analysis for the organism that causes syphilis (<em>T. pallidum</em>) found that the disease strains matched across connected individuals, suggesting that individuals were connected within the same sexual network, although not necessarily directly: the friends may have had sex together or have a sex partner in common that does not appear in the graph. It’s remarkable here that for many pairs where both were infected with syphilis (syphilis-concordant dyads, for short), no sexual partners appear in the graph, and in a few cases both are male.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_12133" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12133" height="297" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-2-300x297.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2</div><div class="attachment-image--source">New cases of gonorrhea</div></figure>
<p>We did the same for gonorrhea.  As before, new cases of gonorrhea identified by asking for social contacts are the large red squares. The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for gonorrhea. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections.</p>
<p>The additional cases of syphilis and gonorrhea identified by asking friendship ties suggest that they under-reported their sexual contacts. These friendship ties may actually be sexual ties that were not reported as sexual; many of these ties were same-sex, and same-sex ties were stigmatized in this community, especially at the time that the data were collected (2001-05). Alternatively, these friendship ties may represent participation in the same sexual networks, such as engaging in a sexual relationship with the same person or people, who were not observed in the data.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Given existing strains on public health resources, public health policy must be creative. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by Disease Intervention Specialists. However, the 2008 recession resulted in large cuts to public health agencies that were never reversed. The Disease Intervention Specialists currently do not have enough resources even to contact all sexual contacts of index cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, so they prioritize vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. Public health agencies simply do not have resources to contact the friends of index cases, and index cases may not cooperate anyhow.</p>
<p>However, large technology companies have created privacy-preserving innovations in SARS-coronavirus-2 contact tracing <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing">protocols</a> that have been deployed in state health department contact tracing apps. These contact tracing protocols identify nearby phones using Bluetooth and approximate the distance and duration. Public health authorities create COVID-19 contact tracing apps using these protocols that can specify distance and time duration for potential coronavirus contacts. These protocols or health department apps could be extended to contact tracing for other diseases. Changing the parameters for distance and duration on public health contact tracing apps could identify potential sexual contacts, allowing these apps to be used for STI contact tracing. The transition to these COVID-19 contact tracing apps has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-contact-tracing-apps-not-slowed-covid-us/">bumpy</a>, with technological limitations, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-to-get-people-to-actually-use-contact-tracing-apps">low uptake</a>, and <a href="https://devops.com/more-than-half-of-americans-willing-to-participate-in-contact-tracing-but-have-major-privacy-concerns/">lack of public trust</a>, especially in government. The Bluetooth distance detection doesn’t do well <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/contact-tracing-apps-struggle-to-be-both-effective-and-private">near shiny surfaces or in public transit buses or trains</a>, and while that’s a large problem for COVID-19 contact tracing, it’s not a problem for STIs. As with many US problems, low public trust in government is the limiting factor for contact tracing, whether traditional or by app.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>As a non-profit, mission-driven organization PLOS abides by our commitment to transparency. We <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">openly share</a> information and context about our finances, including <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">target revenue amounts</a> in some of our emerging business models. The <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a> provided us — and other publishers — a clear, uniform structure to share information about the services we perform and a percentage breakdown of how these are covered by the prices we charge. Many of our mission-driven publishing activities go well beyond peer review and production services. We provide commentary on some of these services, including how the varied editorial setups of our journals contribute to different percentage price breakdowns per title. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data via such frameworks. And, we remain confident in showcasing how our prices cover our reasonable costs for a high level of service, with some margin for reinvestment.</p>



<h3><strong>Full Post</strong></h3>



<p>Since our founding in 2001, PLOS has maintained a firm commitment to transparency. Transparency informs our work within communities. It drives our approach to open science practices &amp; policies. And it underpins our willingness to share financial data. Here are three examples of our commitment in action:</p>



<ol><li>Every year we provide financial transparency via the publication and contextualization of our IRS filings (<a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">2018 financial overview available here; </a>our 2019 overview will be available in November)</li><li>We participate in broader efforts within the publishing community to encourage greater understanding around pricing and the costs of Open Access publishing (see immediately below for the Plan S example)</li><li>Our new collective action business model for <em>PLOS Medicine</em> and <em>PLOS Biology — </em><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> — openly shares how much revenue is required for PLOS to run these specific journals. We will redistribute revenues beyond the target back to community members</li></ol>



<p>This year, we are especially grateful to cOAlition S for spurring the scholarly publishing community, broadly, to engage with transparency via its <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>PLOS Response to Plan S</strong></h3>



<p>In early 2020, PLOS (together with nine other publishers<sup>1</sup>) <a href="https://www.informationpower.co.uk/launch-of-the-plan-s-price-transparency-framework/">piloted </a>one of the two approved pricing transparency frameworks for cOAlition S. We are now <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing">sharing the figures PLOS provided</a> as part of this initiative to provide context to our own pricing and to further promote this kind of transparency broadly within the community. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data as well. (Please see the post on price transparency by our friends at <strong>F1000 Research</strong> <a href="https://blog.f1000.com/2020/08/19/price-transparency-on-f1000research/">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Before diving into discussion of figures, we want to restate two underlying principles.  </p>



<ul><li>PLOS does not charge for any activity for the sole purpose of profit. We do not seek or need revenue surplus for return to shareholders, but rather to support and reinvest in our <a href="https://plos.org/">mission</a>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Our organizational activities are developed to meet the needs of researchers, our prices cover our reasonable costs for our high level of service plus some margin for reinvestment, and our drives for efficiency are to enable as good an author experience as possible.</li></ul>



<p>The Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency framework invited publishers to divide Article Processing Charge, per journal, into seven categories of activity<sup>2</sup>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Journal and community development</strong> <strong>efforts</strong>, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development</li><li><strong>Submission to desk reject or acceptance</strong></li><li><strong>Peer review management </strong>by staff/remunerated people, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected</li><li><strong>Acceptance to publication</strong>, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks</li><li><strong>Services after publication</strong>, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring</li><li><strong>Sales &amp; marketing</strong> to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns</li><li><strong>Author and customer support,</strong> including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting</li></ul>



<p>PLOS’ pricing breakdown (which is only one element of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing">data captured in the spreadsheet</a>) for 2019 is presented in the table below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>PLOS Computational Biology</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Genetics</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Pathogens</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Biology</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Medicine</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS ONE</strong></td></tr><tr><td>APC price</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$1,595</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for journal and community development</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>20%</td><td>18%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price from submission to desk reject or accept</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td><td>15%</td><td>25%</td><td>27%</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for peer review management</td><td>12%</td><td>12%</td><td>14%</td><td>13%</td><td>21%</td><td>23%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services from acceptance to publication</td><td>22%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>12%</td><td>12%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services after publication</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>6%</td><td>6%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for sales &amp; marketing to customers or of articles</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td><td>14%</td><td>15%</td><td>11%</td><td>8%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for author and customer support</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>5%</td><td>6%</td><td>8%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The above is a relatively good way of illustrating the breadth of activities that occur at PLOS, and which our income supports. However, like any framework or metric, it strips away some of the detail and nuance so we wanted to provide some overarching commentary and highlight a few observations.  </p>



<p><strong>Varied Editorial structures drive varied price allocation</strong></p>



<p>Currently, PLOS has two types of editorial setup across our seven journals. </p>



<ul><li><em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em> are supported by senior <strong>in-house</strong> <strong>editorial teams</strong> (including Editors-in-Chief, an Executive Editor, Senior Editors, and Associate Editors) working in conjunction with external editorial boards. </li><li><em>PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> each have <strong>external </strong>Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors (who are full time members of the research, medical, health, and/or academic communities).</li></ul>



<p>The in-house editorial teams (a.k.a. Staff Editors) comprise salaried PLOS employees and are editorially independent. We see this combined expertise of dedicated Staff Editors and leading scientists in the field as an important aspect of the publication process for these titles. Our Staff Editors work to guide researchers through submission and peer review. They also partner with our external Academic Editors, experts in the field, to provide guidance. This unique editorial model ensures expertise, fairness and efficiency for each manuscript. This internal and external resourcing structure is reflected in the greater price share for activities related to “initial triage” and “peer review management” for these particular titles. </p>



<p><strong>Beyond editorial and production</strong></p>



<p>Between 43% – 61% of our journals’ price covers the editorial/production work of receiving submissions, coordinating their peer review, and production and online publication of accepted articles. The remainder of the price covers the broader and deeper work of services before and after the publication process, including marketing, author support, and ethics checks, among other things — each of which is critically important. As examples:</p>



<ul><li>PLOS has a highly regarded <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics">publishing ethics team</a> that handles all  ethical and scientific concerns involving submissions and published articles. It also works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards, develops policies and processes to address integrity issues (at scale) prior to publication, and participates in broader discussions about publication ethics policies and practices.</li><li>PLOS engages closely with research communities (e.g. by attending/organizing conferences/events/workshops, these days mostly online) to ensure the journals and their policies truly reflect the research interests and values of these fields and communities. We operate in both global and local contexts, therefore it is ever more important to ensure we reflect the values of the diverse communities of researchers whom we publish.</li><li>PLOS has a dedicated, proactive <a href="https://plos.org/media/">media team</a> that collaborates with authors, institutions, science media centers and journalists to communicate research to both scientists and society. Consequently, articles published in our journals receive great attention in the media. The team also develops policies and participates in industry conversations about best practices (e.g. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/preprints-and-the-media-a-change-to-how-plos-handles-press-for-papers-previously-posted-as-preprints/">preprints and the media</a>). </li><li>PLOS’ Outreach team promotes articles, invites submissions, promotes initiatives like calls for papers, and has also created widely used and well-regarded resources such as the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review Center</a> and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Center</a>. </li><li>PLOS pilots, develops, and leads the way in <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science practices</a>, from creating new software to be able to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">publish peer review histories at scale</a>, to patiently cultivating trust in science via a rigorous approach to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/">preprints and preprint commenting</a>. </li><li>PLOS is <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">constantly working</a> to make Open Access easier, more efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines. This is both via <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">new business model</a> development, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Open-Access-RFI-Comments-Reduced-5.pdf">policy engagement</a>. </li></ul>



<p>We hope the full data and above commentary can give you some new insights. At PLOS we are proud of what we do. It is our privilege to devote our time and energy towards such crucial matters as increasing trust in science. We will always do this in partnership with the research community. And, perhaps, there has never been a more important time to be doing this.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/skoQOMC8LYE/">Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</a></h4>

<p>It’s the start of Open Access Week 2020 and this year’s theme focuses on “Open with Purpose” with equity and inclusivity as the focal point for the third consecutive year.</p>



<p><strong>Why are we still talking about this?</strong> </p>



<p>At this time, the need for international collaboration and access without restrictions is acutely apparent with COVID-19 pausing regular activities, such as conferences, libraries and other in person events. Building equity and inclusivity will create a stronger environment for scientists to ask questions or see problems from a different perspective. It’s also integral for organizations to reflect on what they can do to help researchers from every background get their research to the communities that need it.</p>



<p><br /><strong>Looking to an inclusive future<br /></strong>OA helps break down many of the barriers researchers face by sharing their findings to a vast readership. Yet, a number of hurdles still stand between them and the final article. At PLOS, we support researchers at every stage of their career, research and discipline. Open Science further increases transparency and visibility of their work so that all researchers can more easily be recognized for their contributions. With a host of journals and a variety of article types and early sharing methods such as preprints and preregistered reports — researchers will have the opportunity to showcase the full breadth of their findings. </p>



<p>We recognize that as an organization we can do much more to assist those in the scientific community that experience challenges due to their gender, race, culture and more. In a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">blog post by Editorial Director Joerg Heber</a>, he outlines our support for a diverse and inclusive community and the areas we’ll continue to improve on to recognize and minimize bias, further diversify our leadership and contributors.</p>



<p><strong>Be counted for your work</strong></p>



<p>OA provides the community with the accessibility to your research to see, cite, and share it. Your research and contributions in the community are vital to scientific advancements. Be proud, in whatever stage of your career, of what you’ve achieved and get the recognition for your contributions, be that through your ORCID iD or citations. The OA community is increasingly adapting to the needs of ECRs. Transparency and early sharing practices for every stage of the research process are becoming increasingly common to support researchers in demonstrating their contributions, beyond just publications. Be the first to report your findings with <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">preprints</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">preregistration</a>, just two ways in which you can highlight your progress early when you’re applying for funding and new positions. </p>



<p>PLOS is always searching for new ways we can make publishing and acknowledging your work easier. Whether that means building a more inclusive framework to ensure credit is shared equitably among contributors, or supporting researchers in making their work more visible.  In a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/">policy announced last week</a>, we’re providing better support to transgender authors with live articles published under names that do not reflect their identity. Our staff will be happy to help update your records and help you keep your previous credits. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. </p><cite>— <em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/">Implementing name changes for published transgender authors</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Open Access is more important than ever</strong></p>



<p>In a time where COVID-19 proves to be a challenging obstacle with restrictions to labs and libraries, it is integral that we’re inclusive of the many groups in the scientific community — researchers around the world need access to content anywhere, anytime. OA is the key to providing fast, public access to research with no restrictions or embargoes. The global benefit of open research is powerful and will help maintain the continuation of scientific advancements.</p>



<p><br />At the heart of inclusivity, cost plays a major role in separating researchers from the Open Access journals they would like to publish in. Over this year we’ve made great strides in partnering with institutions and consortia to bridge the gap between cost for prospective PLOS authors. And we’re continuing to experiment with new models that get closer to a truly open to read, open to publish ideal, equitably distributing the costs of publishing so that the burden of payment doesn’t fall on authors. </p>



<p><strong>Next steps for a fair and diverse future</strong></p>



<p>We will continue to improve our processes and endeavour to be advocates for equity and inclusivity in OA and the broader academic community. Beyond 2020, scholarly communication will need to continue the work around creating inclusive environments for researchers by examining the struggles of systemic inequities, acknowledge bias by working with editors and reviewers, and ultimately take action to create a more accessible future for all. More updates to come! </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1kHrTHEX73c/">Rethinking Research Assessment:Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making (part IV)</a></h4>

<p><em>Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for</em><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><em> </em></a><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><em>DORA</em></a><em>. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.</em></p>



<p><em>In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/">part one </a>of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable . In our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/">second part</a> of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-iii/">In part 3</a> we explored how we gauge value by association. In our final installment we get into how <strong>incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The deep legacy traditions held by many academic institutions can be powerful, contributing a sense of continuity and identity and reducing the need to continually reinvent the wheel. But when these organizational habits and norms become too normalized, and old processes and structures persist because “that’s how we’ve always done this,” they can create an unhealthy sense of insularity that excludes new ideas and people.</p>



<p>One contributing factor to this is<strong> Confirmation bias</strong>, which describes peoples’ tendencies to dismiss evidence that doesn’t fit their initial judgments or preconceptions, even if these presumptions are grounded in subjective experiences and limited data. Failing to gather and consider counter-evidence makes us more likely to fall into old ways of thinking, such as cherry-picking information from a CV to confirm the view we already have, or dismissing potential warning signs because a candidate has already been accepted as a good fit.</p>



<p><strong>Status quo bias</strong>, sometimes known as “effort aversion,” reflects our tendency to take the path of least resistance unless there are strong reasons not to. This can lead to situations where people stick with recognizably flawed processes because the effort to fix them or adopt new ones is perceived as too much effort. For example, the continued use of citations to indicate research quality is driven in part by the fact that it’s perceived as familiar and easier, not necessarily better, than using alternate indicators of real-world impact. For academic institutions — never known as stealthy and agile entities even in the best of times — this can cause significant paralysis, keeping demonstrably subpar structures in place long past their usefulness.</p>



<p><em>What can institutions do?</em></p>



<p><strong>Make it easy.</strong> Sometimes the biggest barriers to adopting new behaviors are actually smaller than one might expect, such as not knowing where to start or a lack of clarity about the value of doing things differently. Making the benefits of new behaviors concrete, salient, and simple to grasp makes both starting and follow-through easier.</p>



<p><strong>Question what you “know.”</strong> Sticking with old assumptions tends to reward those with more traditional backgrounds, which comes at the expense of attracting new or more diverse talent. Productively pushing back on assumptions — even assigning the role of playing devil’s advocate during deliberations — can force all involved to be crisper and more defined about what qualities matter, and why.</p>



<p><strong>Broaden notions of success.</strong> New processes can only go so far if definitions for success (and who’s invited to the table) aren’t also revisited. Setting, publicizing, and adhering to goals that look beyond traditional norms or value alternate experiences can broaden the diversity of individuals under consideration.</p>



<p>Incumbent systems, processes, and structures are inherently advantaged, partly due to familiarity and partly because our tendency toward effort aversion tells us it’s almost always easier to stick with the old, however flawed, than introduce something new. This is especially true when those in positions of seniority have benefited from these legacy systems as their careers have progressed, and when in many cases entire academic careers spent at an individual institution may mean limited insight into even <em>how</em> to do things differently. But the need to introduce more equitable decision-making into RPT decisions to increase the presence of minoritized candidates, researchers, and faculty is very real, and will not happen without a combination of serious intent and structural support. Without active intervention, one model of current post-doc to faculty transitions has indicated that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393">faculty diversity will not otherwise significantly increase until 2080</a>. This is too little, too late.</p>



<p><a><em>To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles.

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/">Giving Week: Why arXiv?</a></h4>

<p>Four million monthly users. 1.7 million articles. More than one billion downloads.</p>
<p>The numbers are clear: arXiv is a critical resource.</p>
<p>But what these numbers don’t reveal? The impact arXiv has had on individual people across the globe.</p>
<p>The excitement of a grad student posting their first article. The junior faculty member who just earned tenure, thanks to research originally shared on arXiv. The productive researcher whose library cannot afford to subscribe to all the right journals. The weekly research group meeting to discuss the most recent arXiv papers. The interdisciplinary collaboration sparked by an arXiv submission. The machine learning enthusiast who tinkers with the arXiv dataset, future discoveries yet unknown.</p>
<h3>“arXiv is like air.”</h3>
<p>These are the words of an arXiv-er. In other words, arXiv is free, totally necessary, and easy to take for granted.</p>
<p>But arXiv is not free to produce, which is why we’re asking you to <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=22315&amp;cid=35778&amp;dids=276&amp;bledit=1&amp;sort=1">join arXiv’s community of supporters with a donation</a> during <strong>International Open Access Week</strong>, from October 19th through the 23rd. We urge you to consider recurring payments in any amount.</p>
<p>More than 80% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from voluntary contributions from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and <strong>individuals like you</strong>. Your contribution will help ensure that arXiv remains <strong>a non-commercial, community resource.</strong></p>
