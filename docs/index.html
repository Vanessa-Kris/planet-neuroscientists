People become less approving of social media outrage the more people join in with it. One person rebuking another is fine, but ten people doing it looks like a mob.

This is the key finding of an interesting new paper called The Paradox of Viral Outrage, from Takuya Sawaoka and Benoît Monin of Stanford.

According to the authors, the titular 'paradox' is that "individual outrage that would be praised in isolation is more likely to be viewed as bullying when echoed online by a multitude of si

<p>In the UK, this has been a year of action on the gender pay gap (the, on average, lower pay for women compared with men), with cross-party MPs launching campaigns like <a href="https://paymetoo.com/">#PayMeToo</a> and the government <a href="https://genderpaygap.campaign.gov.uk/">taking steps</a> to investigate and hold organisations to account on the issue. This has also <a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/jordan-peterson-gender-pay-gap-exist/">attracted</a> <a href="https://iea.org.uk/gender-pay-gap-reporting-isnt-fit-for-purpose/">pushback</a> <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/how-common-sense-shows-gender-pay-gap-is-a-myth/news-story/6f7f2be3ec8c56484f83b798ff6d548f">from</a> those that argue that the gender difference in average pay has many causes, including the different interests of, and life choices taken by, men and women. Now a study <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oep/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oep/gpy021/5046671">published in Oxford Economic Papers</a> has examined another complicating factor, namely whether the gender pay gap is influenced partly by an on-average difference between the genders in a trait not previously taken into account – the motivation to achieve.</p>
<p><span id="more-34654"></span></p>
<p>Leonora Risse and her team from Melbourne’s RMIT University drew on one year’s data from an Australian household survey of about 8,000 people employed full- or part-time. These workers provided information about their jobs, pay and social background, as well as completing a number of personality measures.</p>
<p>Risse’s team first analysed the pay data and found the usual gender gap suggesting women earned AUS $26 dollars an hour, on average, compared with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>$32.50 an hour for men – a difference of nearly 20 per cent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers looked into whether gender-linked personality differences could account for any of this difference, while holding other influences constant.</p>
<p>The classic connections drawn between personality and income are around two of the “Big Five” traits: people higher in conscientiousness – those who pay attention to quality and deadlines and work at a high pace – generally earn more, on average; as do people lower on agreeableness (suggesting there is an advantage for those more able and willing to make unlikeable decisions or put themselves before others).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As is typically seen when comparing the genders, women in this dataset were more agreeable, on average, and this appeared to adversely impact their pay. However they were also more conscientious, which offset things and meant that the net effect of gender differences in these Big Five traits was in explaining just nine cents of the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>But Risse’s team had their eye on another culprit: potential gender differences in a trait called “achievement motivation”, which is made up of the two sub-traits “fear of failure” and “hope for success”. People more motivated by a fear of failure act based on negative emotionality and women<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>typically score higher on this than men. Although fear of failure can propel people to get things done, it isn’t very effective at motivating them to take on new risks or seek opportunities, as this introduces further domains for failure. In contrast with this, the sub-trait “hope for success” drives people towards opportunities with the expectation they will turn out well – and men typically score higher on this trait than women.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Risse and her colleagues predicted gender differences in achievement motivation and its sub-traits would prove important for pay, as a jump forward in earnings often involves taking a risk – asking for a raise, taking a difficult assignment or switching roles or businesses. If men do these things more often – and are more confident when they do so – this could be a component of the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>As expected, in this dataset, women agreed more strongly with “fear of failure” items like “I am afraid of tasks that I cannot work out or solve”, while men agreed more strongly with “hope for success” items such as “I like situations where I can find out how capable I am”. Moreover, average gender differences in these traits contributed to the gender pay gap in the expected manner, together having twice the impact of the Big Five traits, at about 22 cents.</p>
<p>Sharp minds will notice that this means gender differences in the psychological measures accounted for 31 cents, which is only five per cent of the gender pay gap. Gender differences in workplace factors (e.g. the industries that men and women tend to work in, and whether in the private or public sector) made a far larger contribution to the pay gap (around 80 cents). In turn, workplace factors were overshadowed by average gender differences in age and experience – older people with more experience tend to earn more, and in this dataset, more men than women matched this description (accounting for two dollars of the gender pay gap). Average gender differences in skills had a still bigger impact: over $2.50 of the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So, the purely psychological measures turned out to be a bit player in this particular show. But drawing strong conclusions from this fact is difficult. One claim could be that social forces matter more than psychology: men are older in the workforce because of historical barriers to entry and because women who have children face more obstacles in returning to the workforce; skill differences reflect differential access to opportunities; and well-paying industries are not welcoming to women. But while there is considerable force to these social explanations, to view them as fully explaining the gender differences in occupational outcomes is likely to be ignoring other psychological features which weren’t measured in this study. Notably, the well-established gender differences in occupational interests, which <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/17/massive-study-finds-that-a-sizeable-minority-of-us-are-in-jobs-that-dont-fit-our-primary-occupational-interests/">while not deterministic</a>, remain an important driver of what choices people make around work, and the differences in how men and women construe <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/28/theres-a-psychological-case-for-paying-female-managers-more-than-male-managers-or-giving-them-more-holiday/">the trade off between pay and free time</a>.</p>
<p>This study wasn’t trying to provide us with all the answers. What it does show is clear: that, in aggregate, confidence in success and less fear of failure have real effects on wages, and that this may be relevant to the gender pay gap. One might expect that in certain roles and situations, gender differences in confidence could matter even more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Based on their findings, Risse and her team suggest it may help reduce the gender pay gap for some women to undertake motivational and confidence training (although, as they note, personality is not infinitely malleable). The researchers also question whether there is a case for changing organisational cultures – is it necessarily a good thing for a <i>Yes I Can</i> mindset to so often be the one making it to the top? After all, sometimes that attitude can lead an organisation, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=D4-FW4OvG8fawQLTn6vwAQ&amp;q=2007+financial+crisis+risk+taking&amp;oq=2007+financial+crisis+risk+taking&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i22i29i30k1.79132.80058.0.80212.11.11.0.0.0.0.165.1219.2j8.10.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.10.1217...0i22i30k1.0.d-vjwBufB3A">a whole industry</a>, off a cliff.</p>

A new preprint called "A systematic bias in DTI findings" could prove worrying for many neuroscientists. In the article, authors Farshid Sepehrband and colleagues of the University of Southern California argue that commonly-used measures of the brain's white matter integrity may be flawed.



The technique in question, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), uses an MRI scanner to measure the diffusion of water molecules at different points in the brain. In white matter, water diffusion is constrain

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/BF-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Exclusive breastfeeding is known to have many health benefits for infants as they grow, including <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/8/995/htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reduced risk of asthma and other respiratory</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apa.13132" rel="noopener" target="_blank">allergic conditions</a>.  Established risk factors for asthma include family history and male sex.  Use of antibiotics during pregnancy has been suggested as an additional risk factor, but there has been less evidence to support this possibility.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1936-5?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Pregnancy_and_Childbirth-Public_Health-global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Benefits_of_breastfeeding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, Dr. Jun Zhang and colleagues at Shanghai Xinhua Hospital in China studied the interaction between the protective effect of breastfeeding and established risk factors.  In a case-control design, the authors interviewed the mothers of 634 children 3-12 years old diagnosed with asthma and mothers of 864 children of the same ages without asthma diagnosis or symptoms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even among these higher-risk categories …, exclusive breastfeeding eliminated the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics.</p></blockquote>
<p>As expected, they found that half of the children with asthma had a family history compared to only 20% of the children without asthma.  They also found a higher prevalence of boys in the asthma group. Furthermore, they found that 7% of the asthma cases had been exposed to antibiotics during pregnancy compared to 3.5% of the controls supporting the hypothesis that antibiotic use is a risk factor for asthma in children.  The authors calculated that antibiotic use was associated with a 1.7 times increase in the risk of developing asthma.</p>
<p>When the authors divided the cases and controls by whether or not the children had been exclusively breastfed (EBF) for the first six months of life, the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics disappeared in the EBF group and increased to 2.6 times in the non-EBF group.</p>
<p>When dividing the children by sex and family history, antibiotic use was associated with a greater increased risk of asthma in boys and in those with family history (2.2 and 3.1 times higher risk respectively) than in the girls or those without family history.  Even among these higher-risk categories of antibiotics plus another risk factor, EBF eliminated the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics.</p>
<p>The large sample size and the diverse recruitment of the control group make this study very useful in the identification of both risk factors and protective practices for asthma.  Although antibiotics are often necessary to treat harmful infections that could seriously harm a pregnant woman or her fetus, this study highlights that potential risks need to be considered when prescribing antibiotics for less-serious infections.  Additionally, these findings call for studies to determine whether antibiotic type, duration, dosage, and time used during pregnancy affect the risks of children developing asthma.</p>
<p>There are growing efforts around the world to support women in breastfeeding, and the current findings showing that EBF in the first six months of life can attenuate increased asthma risk associated with antibiotic use in pregnancy can bolster these efforts.  The authors hope that these results will be used to advocate for EBF especially in China where the EBF rate is “still relatively low.”</p>
<p>The ways in which breastfeeding might help prevent asthma may be complex, but one possible mechanism is that breast milk could encourage the growth of “good bacteria” in the gut to promote immune development.  More research is needed to determine how the benefits provided by breast milk actually work.</p>

<p>Half of us have been unfaithful in our lifetime, and one in five people within their current relationship. As sexual infidelity is the primary cause of divorce and one of the hardest issues to address in couples therapy, identifying any useful defences could make a huge difference to people’s happiness. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pere.12235?campaign=woletoc">recent paper</a> in <i>Personal Relationships</i> Brenda Lee and Lucia O’Sullivan from the University of New Brunswick investigated what strategies people in relationships use to reduce the chances they will cheat – so-called “monogomy maintainance strategies” – and looked into whether or not they are actually effective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34651"></span></p>
<p>The pair surveyed 362 heterosexual adults aged 19-63 online about how they’d tried to resist temptation when they had been in a relationship and had felt a strong attraction to someone else. Their answers suggested there are three main types of monogomy maintainance strategy: “relationship enhancement”, used by three-quarters of participants, included things like taking a partner out on a date, making an extra effort with their appearance around their partner, or engaging in sexual acts with them;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“proactive avoidance” was similarly common, and involved maintaining distance from the temptation, both physically, and also in terms of avoiding getting close in conversation; and finally “derogation of the temptation”, which was slightly less frequent, and involved applying negativity towards the relationship threat, and guilt towards the self, in an attempt to pour cold water on the prospect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lee and O’Sullivan’s findings suggest these strategies are largely ineffective. Participants reported flirting less when they applied the final, negative kind of strategy. But none of the strategies had an effect on more consequential outcomes: romantic infidelity, sexual infidelity, and whether the current relationship survived. This pattern was borne out in a followup study with more participants that asked them how they were dealing with a threat to a current relationship. So as informative as this research is, it paints a gloomy picture: we may call upon these techniques, but they don’t appear to make much difference in staving off temptation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is some optimism to be found in <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-05467-001">another recent study</a> on the same topic, published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>. This paper zoomed in on moment-to-moment attentional responses, and these seemed genuinely predictive of success in avoiding infidelity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across two experiments, the researchers, led by James McNulty at Florida State University, asked members of 233 newly married couples whether they had ever engaged in infidelity in the relationship – 37 confessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The same participants also completed a task where they had to disengage from images of attractive opposite-sex faces in order to respond quickly to stimuli flashed up elsewhere on a computer screen. McNulty and his team explain how this automatic disengagement from attractive prospects is plausibly an aid to monogamy maintenance, and the data bore this out: participants who were substantially better at disengaging from the alluring pictures were half as likely to have been unfaithful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Another component of the experiment involved rating the physical attractiveness of the images involved in the task. All the participants considered the images as somewhat less attractive than did a separate group of single participants, reflecting a well-established tendency for people in relationships to devalue the attractiveness of others. McNulty’s team predicted that the married participants who engaged in more of this devaluing of temptation would be more likely to be faithful, and again the results confirmed this.</p>
<p>Why is it that these attentional processes were associated with lower infidelity, yet Lee and O’Sullivan’s monogamy maintaining strategies (including the similar-sounding derogating and downplaying of the relationship threat) were ineffective? Perhaps it has to do with the attentional process (McNulty’s team call them “psychological biases”) being automatic, while the monogamy maintaining strategies are more deliberate and perhaps, sometimes, too late. After all, if I meet someone captivating at a party, I might get home and decide to tell myself they aren’t so great (ticking the box for that strategy). But if I’m unpracticed, I may not persuade myself. In fact I may wrestle with myself and end up ruminating on that person all the more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building the automatic, habitual protective processes uncovered by McNulty’s team arguably takes practice. So if we want to maintain our relationships by staying monogamous, sacrifices are needed ahead of time. The well-trained mind can dial down the titillation of temptation to a background hum: it won’t get to enjoy the occasional harmless little interludes, but nor will it be carried away by the crescendo.</p>

<p>It’s well-known that we can miss apparently obvious objects in our visual field if other events are hogging our limited attention. The same has been shown for sounds: in a nod to Daniel Simons’ and Christopher Chabris’ <a href="http://www.chabris.com/Simons1999.pdf">famous gorilla/basketball study</a> that demonstrated “inattentional blindness”, distracted participants in the first “inattentional deafness” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/07/12/introducing-inattentional-deafness-the-noisy-gorilla-thats-missed/">study</a> failed to hear a man walking through an auditory scene for 19 seconds saying repeatedly “I am a gorilla”. Now, two new studies separately show that a very similar effect occurs in relation to touch (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718301227">inattentional numbness</a>) and to smell<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618781325">inattentional anosmia</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34632"></span></p>
<p>Sandra Murphy and Polly Dalton (a co-author on the inattentional deafness paper) at Royal Holloway, University of London report in the journal <i>Cognition</i> on inattentional numbness. They wanted to go beyond the way we rapidly tune out ongoing tactile stimulation, like the sensation of our clothes, and explore what happens when we’re touched more than once out of the blue. (“If someone taps us on the shoulder, are we less likely to notice their other hand going into our pocket?” they write.)</p>
<p>To investigate, they recruited 37 women and 45 men aged 18-47. The participants sat with their hands in front of them, palms up. Bone-conduction hearing aids, which would deliver vibration stimulations, were taped to their palms, and a black cloth was placed over the top, so they couldn’t see any movement. The participants also listened to white noise, to mask any sounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On each trial, the participants were instructed to count the number of vibrations presented to their hands (until the end of each block of trials, the sensations were always to just one of their hands – either the left, or right, counterbalanced across participants). Half the participants were given a relatively easy, low attentional-load version of this task: to count <i>all</i> the vibrations applied to their palms. The others had to keep separate counts of the number of constant vibrations and the number of pulsed vibrations – a task that placed a bigger demand on their attentional resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Each experimental block consisted of 16 trials. On the 16th, an unexpected extra stimulus was applied to the <i>other hand</i> at the same time as the target sequence on the usual hand. Ninety-two per cent of participants in the low-load condition noticed this extra stimulus, whereas 69 per cent of those in the high-load group completely missed it – suggesting they had experienced “inattentional numbness”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The present study provides the first robust demonstration of inattentional numbness to a one-off tactile event that is completely unexpected and therefore genuinely unattended,” Murphy and Dalton write.</p>
<p>This study investigated touch awareness when the brain was already focusing on a touch task. But there’s evidence from earlier work that, for inattentional effects to occur, the two stimuli do not have to involve the same senses, and the new paper in <i>Psychological Science</i> on inattentional anosmia also finds this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford, and Sophie Forster at the University of Sussex, looked at the effects of performing a high vs. low attentional-load visual task on scent awareness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across a series of experiments, groups of participants had to repeatedly search for a target letter – X or N – arranged in a circle together with either five small letter “o”s (the easy, low attentional-load version of the task) or five similarly-sized angular non-target letters, such as W and Z<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(the high-load version), while exposed to the background scent of coffee (open bags of coffee beans were concealed in the room).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Spence and Forster found that those in the high-load groups were much less likely to afterwards report having detected that scent, suggesting that the attention they’d used up on the visual task had left them with a temporary lack of smell, or anosmia. (In two of the experiments, 42.5 per cent fewer participants in the high visual load condition, compared to the low-load condition, reported noticing the smell.)</p>
<p>“The results of the present study establish the phenomenon of inattentional anosmia for the first time,” Spence and Forster write. “In real-world terms, our study implies that people are significantly less likely to notice ambient smells in their surroundings when they are engaged in a visually-demanding task.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the experiments revealed a further intriguing detail: participants could become habituated to the coffee scent even while their attention was absorbed elsewhere, suggesting that the scent had been processed at some level even though it had not reached conscious awareness. This habituation to the scent meant that even after the task was over, and they had plenty of attention to spare, they were less likely to detect the aroma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The present study reveals that olfactory attention shares a key common characteristic with visual and auditory attention, in terms of the effect of perceptual capacity limits on <i>irrelevant processing</i>,” the researchers write (my italics).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in these new studies, neither the smell of coffee nor the gentle, brief secondary touch stimulus were in any way threatening. Not only were they irrelevant to the task at hand, they were also irrelevant to survival.</p>
<p>It remains to be confirmed whether inattentional effects on our multi-sensory awareness are the same for more important or threatening incoming stimuli. There’s reason to think they will be –<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for instance, there’s evidence that pain perception is reduced when other activities or events are hogging our attention (when playing a VR game, for example). It would be interesting to see work exploring whether we can fail even to notice potentially dangerous smells – such as burning – and potentially damaging touch stimuli while we’re concentrating on something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/better-than-the-grant-lottery/">Better than the grant lottery</a></h4>

<p>Funding rates for most research grant systems are currently very low, typically around 10%. This means that 90% of the time spent on writing and evaluating grant applications is wasted. It means that if each grant spans 5 years, then a PI has to write about 2 grants per year to be continuously funded; in practice, to reduce risk it should be more than 2 per year. It is an enormous waste, and in addition to that, it is accepted that below a certain funding rate, grant selection is essentially random (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/13323v1">Fang et al., 2016</a>). Such competition also introduces conservative biases (since only those applications that are consensual can make it to the top 10%), for example against interdisciplinary studies. Thus, low funding rates are a problem not only because of waste but also because they introduce distortions.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a number of scientists have proposed to introduce a lottery system (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959526/">Fang 2016</a>; see also Mark Humphries’ <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/how-not-to-choose-which-science-is-worth-funding-c6b4605ce8f1">post</a>): after a first selection, of say, the top 20-30%, the winners are picked at random. This would reduce bias without impacting quality. Thus, it would certainly be a progress. However, it does not address the problem of waste. 90% of applications would still be written in vain.</p>
<p>First, there is a very elementary enhancement to be implemented: pick at random <em>before</em> you evaluate the grants, i.e., directly reject every other grant, then select the best 20%. This gives exactly the same result, except the cost of evaluation is divided by two.</p>
<p>Now I am sure it would feel quite frustrating for an applicant to write a full grant only to get immediately rejected by the flip of a coin. So there is again a very simple enhancement: decide who will get rejected <em>before</em> they write the application. Pick at random 50% of scientists and invite them to submit a grant. Again, the result is the same, but in addition you reduce the time spent on grant writing by two.</p>
<p>At this point we might wonder why do this initial selection at random? This introduces variance for no good reason. You never know in advance whether you will be allowed to get funding next year and this seems arbitrary. Thus, there is an obvious enhancement: replace lottery by rotation. Every PI is allowed to submit a grant only every two years. Again, this is equivalent on average to the initial lottery system, except there is less variance and less waste.</p>
<p>This reasoning leads me to a more general point. There is a simple way to increase the success rate of a grant system, which is to reduce the number of applications. The average funding rate of labs does not depend on the number of applications; it depends on the budget and only on the budget. If you bar 50% of scientists from applying, then you don’t divide by two the average budget of every lab. The average budget allocated to each lab is the same, but the success rate is doubled.</p>
<p>The counter-intuitive part is that individually, you increase your personal success rate if you apply to more calls. But collectively it is exactly the opposite: the global success rate decreases if there are more calls (for the same overall budget), since there are more applications. This is because the success rate is low because of other people submitting, not because you are submitting. This is a tragedy of commons phenomenon.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to solve it, which is to add constraints. There are different ways to do it: 1) reduce the frequency of calls, and merge redundant calls, 2) introduce a rotation (e.g. those born on even years submit on even years), 3) do not allow submission if you are already funded (or say, in the first years). Any of these constraints mechanically increases the success rate, thus reduces both waste and bias, with no impact on average funding. It is better than a lottery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>p.s.: There is also an obvious and efficient way to reduce the problem, which is to increase base funding, so that scientists do not need grants in order to survive (see this and other ideas <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-few-ideas-to-improve-the-grant-system/">in a previous post</a>).</p>

I was keen to interview the only woman among Human Brain Project leaders, the scientific director Katrin Amunts. In November 2017, she agreed to do an interview by email. In March 2018, Amunts announced that "the manuscript already has a veritable size of several pages". She never contacted me since. This is therefore a non-interview.

<h4>We need to get past the essentialist mindset about coding</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FWTCVAbwOEaK3JPhhBW8JA.jpeg" />Like these plants, you too can grow on keyboards. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>When our summer intern Daniel first joined the lab, he seemed terrified of MATLAB.</p><p>And I can’t blame him — encountering a programming language in the wild is intimidating, especially when you sign up for a summer research program and they ask you to declare upfront whether you’re “computational” or not. Daniel is categorically <em>not</em>.</p><p>Daniel signed up for a “biological” neuroscience lab, so he was surprised when he encountered code in almost every aspect our work. We use it to collect raw data, present stimuli, and analyze gigabytes of output. Collectively, our lab codes in many languages, and most of us are proficient in two or three. We’re not labeled as a computational lab, but each of us has had to learn how to code and employ math for one reason or another.</p><p>So, I encouraged him to give coding a shot. I borrowed a copy of <em>MATLAB for Neuroscientists</em>, gave him a fairly straightforward task to code, and let him loose. I wasn’t really sure how to train him, but I knew one thing for sure: he could learn how to code if he wanted to.</p><h4>Coding on the fly</h4><p>Like many neuroscientists, I never had a formal coding education. I didn’t take any computer science courses — they were encouraged but not necessary (and even now, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all">only a quarter of K-12 schools offer coding classes</a>). I’ve never had to teach anybody how to code, and have only recently begun to consider myself a person who is proficient at coding.</p><p>“How did you learn how to code?” Daniel asks me.</p><p>“Truthfully, through trial and error. And a lot of Google searches.” Oh, and I probably bugged my gracious labmates quite a bit.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*vMCCmCdRBsKzMpAOqDRq1Q.png" /></figure><p>I’ve long thought of myself as a Math &amp; Science Person, so I was open to the idea that I could also be a Coding &amp; Computation Person. We tend to lump all of these skillsets into one larger (STEM) identity: the person who flies through rows of multiplication problems in grade school, excels on quantitative sections of standardized tests, and eventually becomes a coder.</p><p>However, not everyone in neuroscience research identifies as math-y. In fact, many have internalized the idea that they’re “not a math person,” a phrase that is loaded with deep-seated beliefs about how intellectual ability works. More complex computational approaches certainly benefit from advanced mathematics backgrounds, but math experience doesn’t mean you automatically know how to code. Still, because we so strongly associate math, coding, and computation, many folks assume that coding is not for them.</p><h4>Mindsets and labels change how we learn</h4><p>For the past two decades, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve">Carol Dweck</a> and colleagues have been developing a body of research that encourages educators and parents to reconsider the way that we teach children, especially in mathematics. If you ask students and educators to reflect on what makes people good at math, you’ll find that some believe more strongly in fixed or innate abilities, whereas others believe that intellectual abilities are malleable and can be learned. Dweck coined the terms “fixed” and “growth” mindsets to describe our implicit beliefs about intellectual ability. The punchline for math and science education is startling: students with growth mindsets <a href="https://www.mtoliveboe.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/blackwell-theories-of-intelligence-child-dev-2007.pdf">perform better over time</a> (even in <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-07329-012">organic chemistry</a>).</p><p>The story for computer science is similar. Our beliefs about whether computational abilities are fixed or malleable impact our <a href="https://tll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/library/Cheryan_2009.pdf">sense of belonging</a>, <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/learning-is-about-the-failure-and-struggle-not-the-success/">how we respond to difficulties</a>, and ultimately, our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1734263.1734409">achievement</a>.</p><p>In the U.S., we have <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2960332">strong cultural ideas</a> about what it means to be <a href="http://www.pixel42.com/cv/publications/Charters2014_GidgetStereotypes.pdf">a person who can code</a>. Fresh summer interns are picking up on more than just experimental skills — they’re also learning our cultural norms. When we ask students to declare themselves as computational or not, the underlying message is that these skillsets are innate, and only <em>some</em> students are computational.</p><p>Implicit beliefs about computational abilities also intersect with biases about race and gender. Well-meaning people still have implicit biases about gender, race, and math — I’ll be the first to admit that I too am not completely rid of these implicit beliefs, but I’m actively working against them. Worse than unintentionally weighty survey questions or lab descriptors are the more explicit beliefs that some people are mathematically-inclined, and others aren’t. Even if the predominant and politically correct message is that men and women are equal, there are still outspoken sexist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/google-women-engineer-fired-memo.html">Google employees</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/dna-james-watson-scientist-selling-nobel-prize-medal">racist Nobel Prize winners</a>. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-02597-001">Women</a> and <a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6">minorities</a> especially take these messages to heart, and it can be incredibly damaging.</p><p>Early lab experiences are critical windows for young scientists to gain insight about our field and envision their place in it. During this period especially, we should be spreading the notion that <em>everyone </em>can develop coding and computational skillsets (or any other skills, for that matter). These types of positive, growth-oriented messages are impactful, <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/news/new-research-demonstrate-how-specific-interventions-can-boost-success-first-generation-and">especially for first-generation and minority students</a>.</p><h4>Subfield names can be misleading</h4><p>I’m certainly not trying to wash over the interesting subfields of neuroscience. “Computational” can be a meaningful descriptor for labs that <em>do not</em> conduct experimental work. But it doesn’t necessarily work the other way — many molecular biology labs are turning to larger scale analyses across proteomes or genomes, and cognitive neuroscience labs have been well-situated in computational approaches for a long while. And systems neuroscience is increasingly moving into the world of big data as we obtain data from more and more neurons and brain regions.</p><p>Perhaps “theoretical” neuroscience is a better term for some labs, and less loaded with preconceived notions about who is mathematical, and who isn’t. Still, I understand that “computational” has become a primary way to describe research that involves modeling and more complex data analyses, so it may be too late to redefine an entire field. We should at least be cautious when we label labs as computational or not when we’re inviting students in — sometimes it’s just plain misleading.</p><p>Regardless, if you’re new to neuroscience research, know this: <strong>you can be </strong>(and may need to be) a neuroscientist who uses code, math, and statistics to study the brain. Coding is a skill, just like learning how to play a sport or an instrument. You might feel like you’re making more mistakes than other people — you’re not. When I first encountered a coding challenge in graduate school, I was greeted with rows and rows of blaring red error messages. Years later, I still get errors, but I furrow my brow much, much less.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/392/1*-AOcQcA2EaOUWtQMvpu_NA.png" /></figure><p>In thinking about this article, I sat down with a few of the summer interns to chat about academia and ask them their thoughts about the supposed divide between computation and biology. A few had crossed over in their summer internship, either expectedly or unexpectedly. When we discussed Daniel’s experience of encountering lines and lines of code in a “biology” lab, they all nodded in agreement — they didn’t see a firm divide between biological and computational labs. And they’re right, there isn’t. When we focus on the research itself, the boundary crumbles.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FLf47m1aH5fOwnZTGEZEHg.jpeg" />Daniel’s final presentation for the CSHL Undergraduate Research Program (Photo credit: Anne Urai)</figure><p>Daniel is a first-generation college student from Colombia. He’s overcome many obstacles to be here, and has made amazing strides this summer in MATLAB. During his final presentation, he discussed his analysis of gigabytes of behavioral and electrophysiology data, which he performed using his own code. He’s not a computational summer intern, but he sure looks like one.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kp5izAwZz9E/">Transparency, credit, and peer review</a></h4>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p> </p>
<p>Yesterday I signed an <a href="http://asapbio.org/letter">open letter</a> on behalf of all PLOS journals, alongside 20 other editors representing over 100 publications, to commit to offering transparent peer review options.</p>
<p>Support for publication of reviewer reports has been mounting as part of a greater effort to inform the discussion on peer review practice. Our joint commitment to transparent peer review comes on the heels of a <a href="http://asapbio.org/peer-review/summary">meeting</a> we attended earlier this year organized by HHMI, The Wellcome Trust and ASAPbio. Funders, editors, and publishers came together and agreed that elevating the visibility of peer review is paramount for informed scholarly discussion and early career development. Context for the initiatives is provided today in a <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06032-w">Nature commentary</a></em>.</p>
<p>We are excited to be working alongside so many other journals eager to bring posted reviews to our communities and to help change the way in which we talk about and understand peer review.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>Our approach is to let authors and reviewers decide what level of transparency is right for them on a case by case basis. Authors will choose whether to make the peer review history public at the end of the assessment process for their manuscript. Reviewers will decide whether to reveal their identities or remain anonymous. We encourage authors and reviewers to experiment with the new options.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for researchers?</strong></p>
<p>Transparent peer review is a critical first step towards elevating peer review reports as recognized scholarly outputs.</p>
<p>We plan to post peer reviews with a DOI so that it can be cited in the contributor’s CV or referenced as the foundation for further discussion of the work. This is especially critical for early career researchers to be able to demonstrate their varied contributions to their field.</p>
<p>We hope that deeper insight into peer review will strengthen understanding of the scientific record and help future generations of researchers learn about the assessment process.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for change</strong></p>
<p>Before making our decision, we asked our communities what they thought of transparent peer review and surveyed the feedback from other journals that have already implemented or experimented with different forms of transparent review.</p>
<p>In a 2017 survey of our reviewers, 87% of participants said they would be fine with posted reviews. Of the remaining 13%, many indicated that they felt this decision should be left up to the authors, a concern that we’ve taken into account by allowing authors to decide whether they want to publish their peer reviews or not (according to another survey, 45% of them do).</p>
<p>Other journals who offer to post anonymous reviews, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13626"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, <em>eLife</em>, and <a href="http://emboj.embopress.org/content/29/23/3891"><em>The EMBO Journal</em></a>, saw little to no difference in reviewer participation rates after implementing similar policies.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll share what we learn</strong></p>
<p>While transparent peer review isn’t a new concept, it hasn’t yet been widely adopted. With over 23,000 research articles published each year in the PLOS family of journals, there is an opportunity for us to affect meaningful change in the way scholarly communities in all disciplines learn about and understand peer review.</p>
<p>We are excited to offer transparent peer review to our contributors. As we move forward, we’ll be analyzing our processes, gathering data, and listening to feedback from our contributors in order to report back to the community.</p>

Less than two weeks ago, PLOS ONE published a paper about the parents of teenagers who appeared to immediately start questioning their gender identity around the time of puberty. Then the critiques flooded in. The paper — about a highly contentious issue — surveyed parents who felt that their children had suddenly started to question … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/29/reader-outcry-prompts-brown-to-retract-press-release-on-trans-teens/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Reader outcry prompts Brown to retract press release on trans teens</span></a>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/27/whats-personality-got-to-do-with-us-a-lot/">What’s Personality Got To Do With Us? A Lot</a></h4>

<p>Personality is understood as the consistent features we display in regards to our thinking, feeling, and behavior. It begins to emerge around the age of 3. Prior to that, we refer to the genetically primed aspects of who we are as temperament.</p>
<p>Personality is dynamically formed via multiple inputs from many others. It becomes consolidated in our late teens to early 20’s. Around age 30 or so it becomes relatively fixed.</p>
<p>According to Daniel Siegel personality is deeply rooted in the human mind by the flow of information in the brain and between brains, is created via neural/mental representations during this flow, and interpersonal exchanges shape its formation and maturation (1999).</p>
<p>Siegel further adds that these interpersonal interactions construct our personal interpretations of reality. And according to Siegel, maternal and paternal attachments are fundamental in creating the necessary foundation of intrapersonal and interpersonal development. And he indicates emotions are the primary linkage between our intrapersonal and interpersonal worlds. And I believe this early foundation sets for us a lifelong paradigm.</p>
<p>Our life trajectory involves a series of developmental opportunities to build a healthy sense of self and others. This constructs our self-concept in regards to how others see us and feel towards us. It impacts our sense of self-efficacy, confidence and competence, and how others perceive us as being prosocial, asocial, or antisocial; which I refer to as global personality orientation.</p>
<p>For example, Erik Erickson proposes a series of lifelong psychosocial stages. They consist of the following: Trust or Mistrust; Autonomy or Shame and Doubt; Initiative or Guilt; Industry or Inferiority; Identity or Role Confusion or based on my own clinical observations, Role Diffusion; Intimacy or Isolation; Generativity or Stagnation; Integrity or Despair (Plotnik, 2014). And I dare add an additional stage based on my clinical observations, Transcendence and Relief or Dread and Decay.</p>
<p>From the field of Sociology, I borrow the concept of <em>Perceived Social Value</em> (PSV). This applies to the various roles that all of us enact and the concepts of “front-stage and back-stage personas”. Some refer to this as our private and public selves. As a clinician, I am very interested in the extent of the concordance or disagreement between these selves. Those with disordered personalities tend to show a decided disconnect between the two!</p>
<p>Referring back to the notion of roles, over time, we enact multiple roles, sometimes simultaneously. For instance, I was a child, an adolescent, a male, a college student, an Air Force medic during the Vietnam Conflict. Now I am retired. I’m also a father, grandfather, brother, a former university faculty member and the like. Our personality shapes how well we do or do not in these various roles. Those with disordered personalities exhibit rigidity and dysfunction across the various roles.</p>
<p>So as you can readily see, personality has a heck of a lot to do with who we are, and how we interact with the many others we come in contact with!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/27/the-dark-beast-behind-combat-trauma-a-clinicians-view/">The “Dark Beast” Behind Combat Trauma—a Clinician’s View</a></h4>

<p>This particular article is inspired by my perusal of Lt. Col. Dave Grossman’s “On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society” and “Shooting Ghosts” by Thomas J. Brennan and Finbarr O’Reilly. I am a retired clinical psychologist and psychology professor. I also served as an Air Force medic during the Vietnam Conflict. I did not serve “in country”. I served as a medic at Andrews AFB in the emergency room of Malcolm Grow Medical Center. There I witnessed considerable physical trauma. I witnessed death on a number of occasions, some violent, some peaceful. I remember the violent ones.</p>
<p>I also served temporary duty (TDY) at Lackland AFB working with airman stationed in Vietnam, presenting with PTSD and substance abuse disorder (SUD).  As a clinician in Behavioral Health Care, I dealt with folks presenting with multiple psychosocial trauma, including combat Vets from Vietnam.</p>
<p>I’ve not witnessed directly the ghosts of combat. Those who have repeatedly are haunted by those of comrades killed (KIA) and by those who they killed, especially those who are civilians. Thus, they experience what I refer to as “compacted grief”. During war, there is little room and energy to grieve.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Lt. Col. Grossman that most of us possess a natural inclination to not kill other humans. No amount of combat training can prepare soldiers for the realities of war and combat. I see war as an extreme expression of insanity, even when war is deemed by some to be necessary and the participants are “voluntary”. War and combat sear us at the limbic level, a necessary encounter which I refer to as “Dark Beast”. The Vets I have treated and my many clients in BHC have taught me so much about this Beast. The following account here centers on my running commentary as I read “Shooting Ghosts”, using my observing clinical ego.</p>
<p>When I embarked on reading their candid descriptions of encountering repeated episodes of violent death, At times I felt guilty for not having served in Vietnam. I joined the Air Force after my college deferment lapsed once I graduated. I did not really support our endeavor there. I never felt this Conflict to be an urgent and immediate threat to our nation’s integrity. I became a medic so that I would not have to kill anyone, nor would anyone would be killing me. I did therapy with some of the field medics who were confronted with killing. Killing is counterintuitive to our ethical oath to: <em>above all else, do no harm</em>.</p>
<p><u>From Chapter One</u>, I disagree that “Misfits Go to War”. We join the military for a number of reasons. For the most part, the Armed Forces want servicemen with integrity who join for a higher purpose like serving our country and protecting others. The bonds forged with comrades begin during advanced training and intensifies early in deployment. Individual survival is directly associated within this group that we refer to as our squad. It is this commitment that soldiers go into battle and come back as a group which I refer to as “affiliative aggression”. Soldiers are protecting one another!</p>
<p>The second disagreement is that war and journalism do mix in order to inform the rest of us about the horrors and terrors of war, and the tremendous cost borne by those who directly experience it. And none of us are “fearless and invincible”. In fact, my professional experiences assure me that life is quite precious and tenuous at the same time; so we dearly need to hold onto it! And guns and cameras are valuable tools of the respective trades.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Three: Ambushed</u></p>
<p>Now it is kill or be killed by the enemy. Affiliative and defensive aggression is rising. They sustain some injuries and every squad member returns to their outpost. No time for “mental casualties”; the BB is really present for the first time! An RPG creates a concussion suffered by the squad leader.  Back at the outpost “Air Force medics” come to the rescue. Everyone is alive, but are they really? Concussions are quite serious. Each skirmish does not change the outcome of the war; yet indeed changes those who participate!</p>
<p><u>Chapter Four: Walking Wounded</u></p>
<p>The human brain consists of about One Trillion nerve cells, and about ½ of our genome is dedicated to the form and function of this organ. Sounds like a lot and many that can be spared. Indeed, the brain is well known for its neuroplasticity! I’m uncertain as well if God has or has not allowed us to contemplate going to war let alone engage in it. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) also occurred in Vietnam, not just in our more recent conflicts. Perhaps it is garnering more clinical attention? We know that it is also intimately related to Clinical Depression and PTSD. I agree that repeated combat encounters result in a “kinship and loyalty” that many of us will never know!</p>
<p><u>Chapter Five: The in-between</u></p>
<p>The brain and all of our human senses process all of our internal and external experiences. I refer to the brain as a “master accountant”. Much of what we process occurs beneath our conscious awareness. </p>
<p>In fact, there are at least seven streams of awareness. Some are deeply embedded suggesting that we better remember certain experiences more than others to ensure our survival.</p>
<p>Those in combat continue to experience the traumas once confronted repeatedly by the DB! Being back “home” and away from the front lines does not matter. We are genetically primed by our “threat alarm” in responding to perceived and/or real threats by fighting, fleeing, or freezing. Our primary cognitive processes regarding threats pertain to harm, loss, and challenge. We must not ignore them!</p>
<p>Even photographers and journalists are not immune to being harmed or killed! Immunity from stress and trauma is indeed an “illusion”. During adolescence, males exhibit an increase of invincibility (probably due to the significant infusion of testosterone). And there is no “magical cure” for real trauma. And life <strong><em>is </em></strong>more important than what each of us do for a living.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p><u>Chapter Six: Human Triggers</u></p>
<p>Another death of a platoon member, who is very experienced in combat; and he is survived by a wife and children, gets a lot of attention. His loss impacts more than this soldiers. And indeed death is all around as the “Dark Beast” possesses an insatiable appetite for “kills and body counts”.</p>
<p>The effects of TBI on the squad leader are apparent. And there is no room for complacency and lapses of concentration! They are becoming human targets and increasingly aware of this reality. The sights, smells, and sounds of violent death are deeply etched in the collective minds of these soldiers. Home for them seems a long way off! The platoon leader earns a Purple Heart. And he feels he doesn’t deserve it. So far, he and his men are alive.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Seven: Lost Limbs and Skull Tattoos</u></p>
<p>Another photographer is severely injured having stepped on an IED. It is natural to “dread” the “damaged cargo” carried by the MEDEVAC choppers. Some photojournalists become resigned to this possible occupational fate. There is a growing sense that these soldiers may not ever win the “hearts and minds” of the Afghan civilians despite their best efforts to do so.</p>
<p>Some of the violence and deaths of comrades that these soldiers experience are etched on the largest sense organ—the skin. No time to deal with any of this in a combat zone, no time to grieve! Suppression of trauma from previous combat excursions does not work either! And the photojournalist embedded with this squad begins to question his witness position and “feels predatory, repulsive, and a betrayal of human decency”.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Fourteen: Coming Undone</u></p>
<p>The home front is becoming undone. Interpersonal relationships are becoming frazzled. The natural regression after repeated exposure to the “Dark Beast” is taking its toll. All the prescribed psychotropics (chemical cocktails) in the world won’t make that much difference. BTW suicide among combat vets is rising despite priority efforts to prevent them.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Sixteen: Echoes of Iraq</u></p>
<p>The Boston Marathon bombing reawakens images of the “DB” on US soil for the second time since the attack on 9-11. Surely there is no safety and security now! Understandably, cemeteries and headstones serve as triggers. For soldiers converting back to civilian life, there exists a natural disconnect between military culture and the civilian role; clinicians refer to this as cognitive dissonance, and it penetrates much deeper than just our thinking!</p>
<p>Advanced combat training does not really train soldiers to kill the designated enemy, only the illusion of them. And the military certainly does not prepare them to kill civilians such as children, women, and the aged. Yet, this happens in actual combat. For example, during the Vietnam Conflict, it is estimated that more civilians were killed than enemy combatants on both sides. This distinction gets lost in the insanity of combat. Yet the civilian-soldier has to come to terms with this reality; and based on having conducted psychotherapy with Vietnam combat Vets, the grief and regret become almost unbearable! I refer to this state as psychosocial death. Sociologist, Erving Goffman, refers to this as “mortification”. Killing the innocent does not reflect affiliative or defensive aggression. To me, it is an adverse consequence of encounters with the “Dark Beast”.</p>
<p><u>Final Thoughts and Observations</u></p>
<p>First of all, I express my sincere gratitude to all those who have, do now, and will serve in the Armed Forces; and my gratitude to all the loved ones who endure this journey with them. I want you all to know, that in my clinical view, soldiers do what they do out of affiliative and defensive aggression; they are not predators!</p>
<p>Those who send humans to war need to examine much more closely the human damage done to the participants and family members for whatever gains are earned in doing so.</p>
<p>And it is my clinical observation that group counseling/therapy could be more efficacious in treating those who are haunted by the ghosts of combat. Group therapy can recapitulate the crucial military unit- the squad. This offers a better opportunity for some healing from the repeated exposure to the “Dark Beast”.</p>

Louis J. Ignarro knew how to monetize his 1998 Nobel Prize for discovery of nitric oxide as molecular cell signalling agent. He made many millions selling dietary supplement for Herbalife and pomegranate juice for POM Wonderful Company. Some of that found its way (without proper conflict of interest declaration) into Ignarro's peer reviewed papers. Those, done in collaboration with certain Photoshop artists like Claudio Napoli, contain clearly fabricated data.

A preprint recently posted on bioRxiv has garnered a lot of attention - mainly because of its title. The article, from Jan Willem Koten Jr et al., is called Occurrence of non-western magic in the European brain, an intriguing although not very informative title for a scientific paper.

The intrigue deepens once we read the paper and find references to the famous 'voodoo correlations' and also a new species of neuro-monster: 'zombie oscillations', which the authors claim to have discovered and

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/24/the-brain-of-an-introvert/">The Brain of an Introvert</a></h4>

<p>In the age of social media, networking and global never-ending communication, introverts are often viewed as rather inefficient. They are considered as people who would not happily express their opinion during the staff meetings or actively participate in brainstorming sessions. They are often considered to not be good at multitasking or be particularly charismatic. They are rarely at the center of attention at a party, and they often ignore their smartphones for hours in a row. These days, when we believe that big tasks require the active participation of large groups of people working together, being an introvert could come as a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But don’t discard introverts altogether: some of the most successful people in the world are introverts. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and even social media inventor Mark Zuckerberg are all self-confessed introverts. So how do these people who apparently lack some of the basic skills needed for a successful career manage to achieve so much? What makes the brain of an introvert so different and so special?</p>
<h2><font size="6">Being a loner has its upsides and downsides when it comes to health and success</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>It is well known that personality traits are not just the result of social conditioning – they have more to do with the genetics and brain structure. People are born or inherit specific personality traits quite like they inherit any particular physical parameters and characteristics. These personality traits bring their advantages and disadvantages. Studies have also demonstrated the anatomical difference between the introvert and extrovert brain. Imaging studies have shown the differences in both the grey matter and the white matter volumes in the various parts of the brain, thus confirming that personality traits are hard-wired into the brain.</p>
<p>Introverts do not like prolonged social interactions, and they feel uncomfortable in large social gatherings. Introverts don’t mind remaining isolated for extended periods. They love to think and dream. However, this self-imposed social isolation comes at a price. Lower social interaction increases the risk of certain disorders; it may negatively affect cognitive functioning, increase the risk of metabolic disorders, and negatively impact the immune system.</p>
<p>Extreme social isolation and its negative consequences are well studied. People living in orphanages or imprisoned for prolonged periods may go through periods of mental instability, and some may even experience hallucinations. However, being introverts is different, and self-imposed social isolation may not necessarily indicate idle brain or lack of resilience towards these health issues. The latest research studies show that these periods of being alone may have positive impacts on emotional and work life.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Focus on creativity</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>One of the benefits of being more focused on own thoughts is the improved creativity. Introverts are more open to different ideas; they may have a higher level of confidence and independence. Introverts are less concerned about what others may think. Studies have shown that prominent feature of both scientists and artists is the dislike for too much of social interaction: avoiding it leaves them with more time to focus on their ideas.</p>
<p>Introverts have more time to perfect their crafts than those who spend most of the time socializing. They have time to make sense of their thoughts and experiences. All this means that they have higher chances of achieving a eureka moment.</p>
<p>However, it should be understood that not every kind of social withdrawal is the same. Some type of non-socializing is an indicator of psychological and physical health issues. Social withdrawal may be due to shyness and anxiety, or it may be due to a dislike of socializing. Both may have a negative impact on health and would not necessarily better the creativity. On the other hand, those who socialize less just by choice (rather than due to anxiety or dislike) are more probable to be healthy and creative.</p>
<p>These findings are important, as earlier it was believed that unsociability can be harmful. Now the researchers demonstrated that unsociability might be even beneficial. Healthy introverts prefer to spend more time alone, but this does not mean a complete social withdrawal. They would usually have just enough of social interaction. Creative people prefer being alone, and at the same time, they spend enough time in the company of others.</p>
<p>The researchers also noticed that cultural differences may play an important role too. For instance, unsociable children in China had more academic problems in comparison to their Western counterparts. However, this difference is becoming less visible due to globalization.</p>
<p>There is a general belief that specific profession demand more sociable personality and extroverts are better in the leadership roles. However, this is not always accurate, and research shows that a lot depends on the collective nature of the employees. Introvert bosses are more successful if the employees are more sociable. On the other hand, extrovert bosses are better in a leadership role if the employees are less proactive.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Meditation, hermits, and health</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>If we look back into the human history, we understand that self-imposed isolation was commonly practiced by individual members of society. Hermits would practice solitude to achieve nirvana. Daydreaming in the absence of social interactions activates the so-called default mode of the brain. Thus, isolation helps in consolidating the memories and emotions, at least to a certain extent. Isolation helps a person in re-organizing thoughts. Interestingly, when people come out of self-imposed isolation, they are likely to socialize better and more effectively.</p>
<p>Researchers also warn that the boundary between the dangerous isolation and useful solitude is quite blurry. Extreme loneliness could be somewhat harmful or indicative of poor health. Practicing solitude to stay productive and creative does not mean being completely unsocial. On the other hand, there is a real danger for the physical and mental health of those who are never alone. Furthermore, research indicates that introverts have fewer but stronger bonds with others that lead to better satisfaction in life and greater happiness.</p>
<p>If a person does not like to socialize too much, there is nothing wrong with him or her. It is important that the solitude is a person’s choice and not forced upon him/her: even the classical introverts need few good friends.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/news-media-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldwide</a>, 1 in 3 women experience some form of gender-related violence.  Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) doubles a woman’s risk of depression and alcoholism and can have an impact on her risk of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and on her children’s health.</p>
<p>In its <a href="http://www2.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/57/egm/report-of-the-egm-on-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls%20pdf.pdf?v=1&amp;d=20140917T100704" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> on prevention of violence against women and girls (VAWG), the UN Commission on the Status of Women named many stakeholders in prevention efforts.  Among these are mass and new media, which play a big part in contributing to and maintaining gender stereotypes that can lead to cultures of violence and victim-blaming.</p>
<p>In order for media to play a role in preventing VAWG, we must first understand how VAWG is currently reported.  A <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0621-1?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Ghana_media_reporting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> published today in <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>BMC Women’s Health</em></a> used frame analysis to examine representation of VAWG in Ghanaian media.  Lead author Dr. Ebenezer Owusu-Addo of the <a href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kwame Nkrumah University of Science &amp; Technology, Ghana</a> explains the reasons for doing this study:</p>
<p>“The media has been identified as one of the key stakeholders that could help prevent VAWG through responsible news coverage that informs the public about the causes and effects of VAWG. However, to date, studies conducted on media coverage of VAWG have largely focused on high-income country settings such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada, leaving a major gap in the literature regarding media coverage of the issue in low- and middle-income country settings where VAWG is endemic. In this study, we examined how VAWG in Ghana, a lower-middle-income country, is framed by the media, and the implications of this for health promotion.”</p>
<h3><strong>What did the coverage look like?</strong></h3>
<p>In examining 48 news articles, Dr. Owusu-Addo and colleagues found that most reported incidents were covered only by a single, short article without any in-depth reporting.  The vast majority of the articles, 44 out of the 48, framed VAWG as individual incidents with no discussion of the broader social context.</p>
<blockquote><p>Defining the scope of the problem, as the authors have done here, is the first step in reducing VAGW …</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that 80% of the incidents examined in this study were forms of IPV, perpetrated by a spouse, fiancé, or other intimate partner, stems from prevailing attitudes in which “… the typical Ghanaian family is still a patriarchal institution. Currently, attitudes in Ghana about VAWG include men considering it a marital right to control and discipline their wives, and perceived culpability of women and girls for acts of violence meted out against them,” says Dr. Owusu-Addo.</p>
<p>He continues, “The most prevalent attitudes that maintain the status quo include harmful social norms arising from gendered culture which sees women and girls as subordinate to men and boys, respectively. For instance, married men are perceived to have unreserved sexual access to their wives, leading to various forms of sexual assaults against women.”</p>
<p>Other problematic trends identified in the studied articles included normalizing incidents of VAWG as commonplace, coverage that focused on the perpetrator as the subject and victim/survivor as the object of the news story, exoneration of perpetrators, and victim blaming.  These are largely comparable to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1557085113480824" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studies</a> conducted in high-income countries, suggesting that initiatives to change these trends could work across multiple settings.</p>
<h3><strong>Changing media coverage</strong></h3>
<p>When asked how the media could promote social change and support VAWG prevention initiatives, Dr. Owsu-Addo suggested that news coverage could “thematically frame VAWG by focusing on social construction of the issue, challenging gender/social norms that are inimical to prevention efforts, raising awareness about support services available to victims, and eliciting political will for investment of resources for health promotion interventions focusing on prevention of VAWG.”</p>
<p>He adds that “the ideal news coverage of VAWG that would promote social change and contribute to VAWG prevention efforts moves beyond primary sources of information such as perpetrators and criminal justice officials (which often lead to victim blaming) to utilizing the perspectives of VAWG experts/advocates and providing statistics which help contextualize and frame the issue thematically.”</p>
<p>Defining the scope of the problem, as the authors have done here, is the first step in reducing VAGW, which will have to be a joint effort by many stakeholders including policy makers, health professionals, journalists and advocates.</p>

<p>For decades, personality psychologists have noticed a striking, consistent pattern: extraverts are happier more of the time than introverts. For anyone interested in promoting wellbeing, this has raised the question of whether it might be beneficial to encourage people to act more extraverted. Evidence to date has suggested it might.</p>
<p>For example, regardless of their usual disposition, people tend to report feeling happier and more authentic whenever they are behaving more like an extravert (that is, more sociable, active and assertive). That’s a mere correlation that could be interpreted in different ways. But lab studies have similarly found that prompting people, including introverts, to act more like an extravert makes them feel happier and truer to themselves.</p>
<p>Before we all start doing our best extravert impressions in pursuit of greater happiness, though, a team of researchers led by Rowan Jacques-Hamilton at the University of Melbourne urge caution, writing in their new <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8ze6w/">pre-print</a> at <em>PsyArXiv</em> :</p>
<p>“Until we have a well-rounded understanding of both the positive and negative consequences of extraverted behaviour, advocating any real-world applications of acting extraverted could be premature and potentially hazardous.”</p>
<p>To help, these researchers have conducted the first ever randomised-controlled trial of an “act more extraverted” intervention, and unlike in previous research, they looked beyond the lab at the positive and negative effects of such an intervention on people’s feelings in daily life.</p>
<p><span id="more-34599"></span></p>
<p>Dozens of participants were allocated at random to either the “act like an extravert” condition or to an “act unassuming, sensitive, calm and modest” control condition (the idea was that this control condition would match the extravert condition for social desirability and the experience of being in an intervention, and that it would encourage the adoption of behaviours representative of several of the other main personality traits, such as agreeableness and emotional stability).</p>
<p>There was also a second control group who completed some of the same measures but who did not follow any instructions to change their behaviour.</p>
<p>The true aims of the study were concealed from the participants and they didn’t know about the conditions they weren’t in. For the extravert and first control groups, their challenge was to follow the behavioural instructions they’d been given for seven days straight whenever interacting with others in their daily lives (though not if doing so would be inappropriate for the situation they were in).</p>
<p>The participants completed baseline and follow-up surveys about their feelings and behaviour, and through the seven-day period of the study they also answered in-the-moment psychological surveys six times a day whenever prompted by their smart-phones. Their phones also gave them periodic reminders to alter their behaviour according to the condition they were in.</p>
<p>For the average participant, being in the “act like an extravert” condition, as compared to the first control condition, was associated with experiencing more positive emotions (excited, lively and enthusiastic), both in the moment, and in retrospect, when looking back on the week. Compared with the second control condition, the benefits to positive emotion were only seen retrospectively. On average, participants in the “act extraverted” condition also felt greater momentary and retrospective authenticity.  These benefits came without any adverse effects in terms of levels of tiredness or experience of negative emotion.</p>
<p>“Thus, the main effects of the intervention were wholly positive, and no costs of extraverted behaviour were detected for the average participant,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>At least in relation to their experience of more positive emotion, if not so much authenticity,  the advantages of being in the “act like extravert” group were to a large extent mediated by participants in this condition following the instructions and actually acting more extraverted more often (though interestingly, not with being in more social situations, suggesting a change in the quality of their social interactions, not the quantity of them).</p>
<p>However, the story does not end there because the researchers looked to see whether the apparently cost-free positive benefits of the “act extraverted” intervention also manifested for the introverts in their sample. Although previous research has suggested introverts and extraverts alike benefit just the same from acting more extraverted, this was not the case here.</p>
<p>First and unsurprisingly, introverts did not succeed in increasing their extraverted behaviour as much as other participants. And while the introverts in the “act like an extravert” condition did enjoy momentary gains in positive emotion, they did not report this benefit in retrospect at the end of the study. Unlike extraverts, they also did not show momentary gains in authenticity (it didn’t suffer either, though), and in retrospect they reported lower authenticity. The “act extraverted” intervention also appeared to increase introverts’ retrospective fatigue levels and experience of negative emotions.</p>
<p>Jacques-Hamilton and his team said that these were perhaps their most important findings – “dispositional introverts may reap fewer wellbeing benefits, and perhaps even incur some wellbeing costs, from acting more extraverted”. They also made an important point that strong introverts may not desire to experience positive emotions as frequently as extraverts.</p>
<p>The idea that introverts could gain something from learning to be more extraverted more often is not dead, though. Not just because this is only one study and more research is obviously needed, but also because those in the “act extraverted” condition did, after all, still report more positive emotions in the moment than the first control group. And their failure to do so in retrospect (and their purely retrospective reports of increased fatigue and inauthenticity) could possibly reflect a memory bias, mirroring earlier research that found introverts do not expect acting extraverted to make them feel good.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider was that this was a one-size-fits-all extraversion intervention that provided little guidance on how exactly to achieve the aim of acting more extraverted. It’s possible that a less intense version, together with support and guidance to make any behavioural changes become habitual (and therefore less effortful), could help even strong introverts enjoy the benefits of acting more extraverted than they would do normally. “By allowing more freedom to return to an introverted ‘restorative niche’, a less intensive intervention might also result in fewer costs to negative affect, authenticity and tiredness,” the researchers added.</p>

<p>In humans, vision is the major channel for receiving information about the world. The same applies to the majority of animals, even those that are nocturnal and have to rely more heavily on the inputs from other senses. There are, however, exceptions: some mammals use echolocation to construct a picture of their surroundings, effectively using it instead of vision. How effective is this method of gathering information, and can it substitute vision successfully?</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>Echolocation is used by several kinds of animals for navigation in various environments. Whales, dolphins, and bats emit calls (high-frequency sounds) and then listen to the echoes returned from different objects surrounding them. The distance to objects can be estimated based on the time delay between the production of the call (click) and detection of the echo. Since the sound travels in the air with the speed of 340 m/s, a delay of 2 milliseconds, for instance, would mean that the object/target is about 34 cm away.  In addition, sounds travel faster in water than in the air, making the clicking signals produced by whales of shorter duration than the signals produced by bats. Some echolocation signals produced by dolphins and sperm whales are even audible to humans.</p>
<p>Echolocation and its importance in the animal kingdom have been widely studied. Nature provides remarkable examples of how efficient echolocation can be. Bats easily detect tiny insects several meters away in complete darkness. Some species of bats in China and South America can fish in the darkness using echolocation, detecting ripples on the water surface that are indicative of the presence of fish under the surface. Sperm whales use echolocation to find and catch prey, mostly giant squids, deep in the ocean. These whales can dive to the depth of well over 2 kilometers and navigate through underwater canyons where their prey lives.</p>
<p>Although echolocation can be very efficient, it is not particularly common in the animal kingdom and was, in fact, developed independently by several groups of evolutionarily unrelated species. This is markedly different from vision, which is present in the majority of animals, with mechanisms perfected over millions of years of uninterrupted evolution.</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation and Vision in Bats</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>If echolocation delivers essentially the same information as vision, can echolocation rely on the brain processes related to the processing of visual information?</p>
<p>To answer this question, scientists have investigated brain mechanisms underlying the processing of echo signals that allow animals to map objects in term of distance and direction.</p>
<p>Recently, an interesting study was conducted in bats with the aim of revealing what is happening in their brain while they fly through a room filled with obstacles (i.e., acoustically reflective plastic cylinders hanging from the ceiling). In order to determine the mechanisms underlying the bats’ navigation around these obstacles, researchers performed simultaneous chronological neural recordings.</p>
<p>The results show that the bats adjusted their flight and sonar behavior in order to respond to the echoes coming from the objects in the room. The objects’ positions were changing across the recording sessions, and bats started their flight from different start points to make sure that they didn’t rely on spatial memory from previous sessions and used only echo feedback to navigate.</p>
<p>The most important finding was the identification of the brain region that helped the animals to locate the objects in their environment. Echolocation signals were processed in the superior colliculus, a structure located in the midbrain. The superior colliculus consists of several layers that respond to different kinds of stimuli. Deeper layers of the superior colliculus are known to be involved in the processing of visual information. Thus, it seems that echolocation may indeed help animals to obtain a picture of their environment that is as authentic as the picture received through visual channels.</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation and Vision in Humans</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>According to scientists, echolocation is not a phenomenon completely alien to humans. It seems that some blind individuals can be trained in echolocation.</p>
<p>Using this technique, they can locate objects by generating mouth clicks and listening to their echoes. The returned echoes can provide them with important information such as position, distance to and even the size or shape of the objects.</p>
<p>Several studies were conducted in order to determine the underlying neural mechanisms involved in human echolocation. One study investigated two individuals skilled in echolocation, one early and one late blind. The authors of the study measured brain activity in both participants while they were listening to their own echo sounds. They compared brain activity with clicks that produced echoes with the brain activity of control sounds that did not result in echoes.</p>
<p>It turned out that the processing of echo sounds activates brain regions that are typically associated with vision rather than hearing.  More specifically, echo signals were processed in the visual cortex (rather than in superior colliculus like in bats and other echolocating animals). However, the processing of visual information in humans is centered around the visual cortex rather than the superior colliculus, as the human visual cortex has significantly expanded compared to most animals.</p>
<p>Thus, in both animals and humans, the information received through echolocation is processed in those regions that are also predominantly responsible for the processing of visual information. The curious examples of human echolocation are a perfect illustration of the plasticity of our brain and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances (blindness in this case).</p>
<p>A recent publication on echolocation in humans reviewed the applications of this phenomenon as well as the processes occurring in the brain of echolocation experts (i.e., individuals that are skilled in echolocation). They have reported that echolocation may enable blind people to sense small variations in the location, size, and shape of objects, or even to distinguish different materials the objects are made of, simply by listening to the echoes of their own mouth clicks.</p>
<p>It seems that echolocation may be perfected by blind individuals to facilitate the handling of daily tasks and achieving a higher degree of independence. Based on neuroimaging studies, the review confirmed that the processing of input signals from echoes activates the visual cortex, a brain part that would normally support vision in the sighted brain.</p>

<p>Workplace wellness programmes are an assemblage of wellbeing activities like yoga or cycling clubs, packaged together with diagnostic activities like biometric screenings; their aim is to reduce sickness, increase productivity and cut insurance costs for an organisation’s members. This is big business – in the USA, the market is around $8 billion – with a return-on-investment claim, thanks to a plethora of studies that tout the benefits of these programmes (for example, see this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075081">meta-analysis</a> from 2010). But whether staff enter these kind of initiatives in the first place is usually up to them, making it hard to evaluate their effectiveness, as those who choose to participate may differ in key ways from those who do not. To assess the benefits of the programmes accurately therefore requires a randomised-controlled study. This is what the National Bureau of Economic Research <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24229">published recently</a>, and it leaves these programmes looking sickly.</p>
<p><span id="more-34593"></span></p>
<p>Damon Jones and his team set up a staff wellness programme at the University of Illinois containing the three core elements of such programmes: a biometric screening to give an indicator of overall health and a health risk assessment to flag up specific risks for the individual and indicate routes to improvement. Finally there were the activities themselves, including programmes for weight management, guidance on smoking cessation and healthy workplace habits, and tai chi sessions. Over 12,000 university employees were invited, of which nearly 5,000 showed an interest and completed surveys covering their health status, health-care use, job satisfaction and productivity.</p>
<p>Around a third of these interested people were then randomly assigned to a control condition and received no further support. The others were invited to be screened, risk assessed, and then to take on the available wellness activities offered over two semesters. Finally, at the end of the academic year in July, one year after they first enrolled in the programme, the participants completed a follow-up survey covering the same topics as at baseline, plus some additional questions.</p>
<p>Sickness takes a toll on national economies – the cost to the US economy where this research was conducted is <a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/worker-illness-and-injury-costs-us-employers-225-billion-annually">over $200 billion per year</a>. Based on the new evidence, do wellness programmes show promise in making a dent in it? Unfortunately not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Compared to the control group, participants in the programme did not take significantly fewer sick days. Nor were they more likely to stay in their job, nor get a promotion or get a pay hike. They didn’t spend any less on medication or hospital visits, undermining the financial rationale in reducing medical insurance claims (or in the UK, burden on the health service). And those in the programme showed no improvement in health behaviours such as using the gym or taking part in a popular annual running event. A few effects proved statistically significant – feeling subjectively happier at work and one measure of job satisfaction – but the remaining 37 measures were non-significant.</p>
<p>It seems that the past studies that <i>did</i> find effects have been riding on a selection effect due to the kind of people who choose to get involved in such programmes.</p>
<p>Looking at the 7,000-plus people who declined to engage in the wellness programme on offer in the current study, we see they were, on average, older and had either more medical spend than average, or were zero-spenders on health (i.e. suggesting either unusually poor or good health prior to the start of the study). Those who signed up and were enrolled in the programme, but dropped out, were also more likely to be either high-spenders or zero-spenders on their health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These group differences in health were mirrored in income, where those who didn’t engage in the programme tended to be rather wealthy or poor. Those who did engage were already, before the study, much more likely to be active at the gym or go running.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To summarise, those staff most inclined to opt to take part in the wellness programme were active, fairly young, and moderately well-off, with little evidence of chronic health problems. If these patterns generalise to the opt-in patterns at other organisations, it makes it unsurprising that prior wellbeing programme research (that hasn’t used a randomised design) has tended to find good health outcomes for participants – they would probably be doing well regardless.</p>
<p>This stringently-designed study suggests that there is no “return on investment” case for these programmes, at least in the form investigated here. The programmes may have a tangential benefit in attracting healthy workers to the organisation – a sort of targeted perk – but not in raising wellbeing as they proclaim. And the population you would most hope to aid – those who are poorer, currently less active, and with more pressing health issues – are the least likely to engage, although they will still be paying towards the programmes through insurance premium hikes (or taxation in other systems).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This study can’t speak to why certain individuals are deterred from signing up, but perhaps it has to do with their other commitments and dependents, and their perceptions of the programmes as somehow not for them. To increase up-take among these groups will therefore likely require addressing these perceptions and providing additional support to help overcome any obstacles to taking part.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, the impression of a positive impact given by wellness programmes looks largely a mirage.</p>

<h4>Distrusting biological metaphors</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/836/1*x_sqdM_Mi4Q2ULWQBlvosA.jpeg" /></figure><p>“The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be ‘Seek simplicity and distrust it.’”</p><p>— Alfred North Whitehead</p><p>Simplicity is powerful. Economists seek minimal models to describe market fluctuations, and our greatest mathematicians use the guiding light of elegance to discover their next great truths. But is this preference a fundamental reflection of nature’s workings, or an aesthetic one? Occam’s razor — positing that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one — is particularly abused in biology. As Eve Marder has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721233/">long argued</a>, biological systems are equipped with redundant strategies and contingencies that confound the interpretation of even the most tightly controlled biological experiments. Even the idea of probing a “controlled” biological system merits careful reflection. By controlling for variables, we stray from reality, instead describing an abstract, manipulated system, and often still failing to account for the hundreds of cellular mechanisms we don’t yet know about. (Take, for example, surprising work from Didier Stanier and colleagues, who recently reported that knocking out a gene with CRISPR leads to the expression of homologous genes to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/22/328153">compensate for the loss</a>.) In a debate held a decade ago, <a href="http://www.voicesfromoxford.org/video/Homage-to-Darwin-part-2/63">Richard Dawkins and Lynn Margulis argued</a> about the role of symbiosis in evolutionary theory. An exasperated Dawkins asked: “why on earth would you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it’s so unparsimonious and uneconomical?” Margulis replied: “because it’s there.” Parsimony for parsimony’s sake is not parsimonious in the biosciences.</p><p>It’s important to recognize that our formalization of biology is fundamentally historical — philosophers like Hans-Jorg Rheinberger, Bachelard, and others have argued that biology has been primarily technology (rather than hypothesis) driven. The ideas of biology are inextricable from the technology that produces them. As Rheinberger put it: “phenomena and instrument, object and experience, concept and method are all engaged in a running process of mutual instruction.” Our resultant understanding of nature is dominated by our choice of experimental system, which includes our instruments, the model organism, even the culture wherein a discovery is made: the knowledge generated is, in some very real ways, as contingent as the processes it describes. We fit discovered phenomena with simple handles — reduced, for practical purposes, to a sort of currency to be exchanged between labs, resorting to pale metaphors when communicating the natural mysteries.<br /> <br /> It’s clear why we do this. It’s in part a heuristic shortcut, making things easier to wrap our heads around. We want to <em>understand </em>nature — we, being individual humans, not as the vague “human collective.” We therefore seek truths <a href="http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/08/18/if-we-already-understood-the-brain-would-we-even-know-it/">comprehensible to a single intellect</a>; and so, as the parable goes, we’re searching for our keys under a streetlamp. Even so, it seems so inherently <em>obvious</em>, so inarguable that true things should be simpler things. The instinct to discover the rules of nature is older than man: the nervous system is biology’s greatest prediction algorithm, and it dutifully learns patterns whose knowledge might enhance its chance of survival (science being the formal application of this impulse). Thus, human thought is underpinned by an unconscious aesthetic laid down in the nervous system itself.</p><p>Studies suggest we naturally tend to find satisfaction in simplicity, in learnability (often through <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-repetition-can-turn-almost-anything-into-music">repetition</a>)— in that which is <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/TICS686.pdf">easy</a> to process. In music, for example, the most universally enjoyable songs lie somewhere between tedious simplicity (like the worst of pop) and unpredictable entropy (like some modern composers). We’re just acting after our nervous system’s modus operandi when we seek learnable patterns. Maxims that appear to be self-evident — e.g. something along Occam’s logic, “a simpler explanation is better” — may only appear to be so because they’re rewarded within the system that evaluates them. That is, they’re self-reflective: the nervous system, itself effectively a simplifying model of its environment, seeks to uncover patterns that render its existence more manageable. It’s evaluating a reductive internal model against its own implicit function. The mind is a causality inferring machine: the impetus to ascribe linear causal relationships is inbuilt to our nervous system. Armed with this hammer, the whole messy universe looks like an elegant nail.</p><p>Of course, ultimately, what we want to do with science is to uncover what Dawkins has referred to as “economically expressed rules.” We are interested in the <em>objects</em> of life primarily because they point us to the <em>process</em> of life. We don’t count the color bands of a beetle for the sake of knowing this fact, but because our understanding of rules often emerges from collections of observations — in the beetle’s case, for example, untangling the logic of developmental programs. But is there even a clear boundary between biological object and process?</p><p>For example, it’s often said that biological entities perform computations (we’ll ignore, for the time being, the fact that no one can agree what is meant by computation): the organism an object, and computation its process. In doing so we suppose a separation between software and hardware, algorithm and data. But organisms are also the <em>result</em> of computations: cells can be thought of as “<a href="http://emboj.embopress.org/content/36/5/568.long">testing hypotheses</a>” during the development of an embryo, for example. Both evolution and nervous systems are the results of computations becoming embodied in the architecture of their computers. Even in machine learning, as Sunderhauf et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06557.pdf">recently argued</a>, “there is a spectrum — rather than a dichotomy — between programming and data.” Indeed, the success of machine learning, despite its inelegance, underscores the fact that simplicity isn’t necessarily a useful goal.</p><p>Evolution has never (until, perhaps, soon) operated by reason, but rolls of a die. The resultant systems are rife with feedback loops and interdependencies. Neuroscientists too often conflate observational studies with causal explanations of behaviors, but a description or manipulation of what neurons or networks are active during a behavior is not the explanans of that behavior. ‘Necessary and sufficient’ doesn’t work the way <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/12543/1/GomezMarin2016_CausalCircuitExplanations_FINAL.pdf">neuroscientists usually use it</a>. Thirty years ago, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3916328">Randolf DiDomenico and colleagues proposed </a>that we avoid making causal claims in individual papers, and instead build them from multiple studies using various techniques and approaches. Given the sheer complexity of these networks and amount of data we’ve generated, this is increasingly beyond the scope of individual human intellect. All this is to say: think hard about what it is you wish to show with your studies. Be humble in your claims. Pragmatism may be a more holy grail than Truth. Or, as Hemingway (perhaps apocryphally) advised: kill your darlings.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/22/the-brain-and-genes-in-addictive-behavior/">The Brain and Genetics in Addictive Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Addictive behavior is a major global health concern. Addiction is commonly defined as the repetitive use of substances or a repetitive pattern of behaviors that are harmful. It is believed that addiction is a brain disorder, meaning that it is caused by the impact of drugs or other addictive substances/influences on the brain and it can be modified by different environmental factors.</p>
<p>The presence of specific variants of some genes may promote or decrease the chances of developing an addiction. According to scientists, genetic factors may play an important role in determining both the vulnerability to addiction and the response to treatments aimed to cure addiction.</p>
<h1><font size="6">The Brain and Genetics in Addictive Behavior</font></h1>
<p>One group of researchers demonstrated that polymorphisms in the genes encoding for opioid receptors and opioid ligands, and more specifically the MOPR gene (<em>OPRM1</em>), is associated with drug addiction. It has been found that one variant of this gene contributes to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/08/02/the-genetics-of-alcoholism/">alcoholism</a> and heroin addiction.</p>
<p>Another study has found that carriers of the same gene variant experience a more pronounced sensitivity to pain and decreased analgesic response to opioids, which means that they require higher doses of morphine in the management of pain, such as pain associated with cancer.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Heroin and Opioids</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>Some authors underlined that addiction to MOPR agonists, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/11/11/opioid-addiction-inherent-differences-in-brain-functions/">including heroin</a>, has become epidemic in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. According to the same authors, the endogenous opioid system interacts with other neurotransmitter systems in the brain. More precisely, opioid receptors regulate the release of dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters with important roles in mood.</p>
<p>Additionally, the opioid system seems to interact with noradrenergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic pathways, as well as with neural growth factors. Furthermore, these studies indicate that chronic exposure to opiates alters gene expression in the brain, and this causes long-term changes in neuronal networks.</p>
<p>Activation of opioid receptors leads to changes in the expression of genes in the above-mentioned neurotransmitter pathways. Variations in the genes of those pathways may determine whether someone is more prone to the development of opiate addiction.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Cocaine</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>One very recent study published this year revealed that the use of cocaine and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/15/gambling-addiction-is-it-as-bad-as-cocaine/">cocaine addiction </a>are associated with certain variants of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, along with lower expression of this gene.</p>
<p>More specifically, the authors of the study compared the expression level of this gene in chronic cocaine users and healthy controls. Apart from significantly lower gene expression in the cocaine users, the carriers of some gene variants were at increased risk of cocaine addiction. In addition, they scored higher on depression scales.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Dopamine</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font> </p>
<p>It seems that the major challenge in understanding and treating addictive disorders is understanding why some individuals develop addiction while others do not. According to research findings, whether or not a person will become addicted depends largely on genetic factors, which contribute ~50% of the risk for addiction.</p>
<p>The processes in our brain are also important. It is well established that the rewarding effects of drugs and addictive substances, in general, are based on their ability to increase the level of dopamine in the brain. Accordingly, imaging studies have shown that individual variations in brain circuits modulated by dopamine, including circuits involved in the mechanisms of reward, contribute to the inter-individual variability in the vulnerability to addiction. Thus, it seems that the roles of genetic factors and brain pathways in the addiction may be intertwined via dopamine.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Alcohol and tobacco</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>Apart from drug addiction, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/21/a-long-way-to-sobriety/">addiction to alcohol</a> seems to depend on genetics and is influenced by heritage. A recent study has investigated the effects of parental drinking on the use of alcohol in young adults. More than 3500 adolescents and their parents have been included in this prospective research. As results have indicated, young adults whose parents are moderate or high alcohol consumers are more prone to alcohol consumption than those young adults whose parents don’t consume alcohol or consume it in low quantities.</p>
<p>Alcohol and tobacco use represent leading global health risks, which are responsible for 3.3 and 6 million premature deaths per year respectively, according to the World Health Organization. Genetic factors were estimated to contribute 40-60% and 40-85% to the development of alcohol and tobacco addictions respectively.</p>
<p>Finding out which genetic variants are associated with alcohol and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/25/smoking-behavior-and-the-transtheoretical-model-of-the-stages-of-change/">tobacco addictions</a> would be an important step in understanding their underlying mechanisms and developing the effective therapies. Over the last years, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been performed in order to elucidate the role of certain genes and their variants in alcohol and tobacco use. These studies have recognized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, i.e., gene variants with a difference in a single nucleotide) are important for developing these addictions.</p>
<p>For alcohol addiction, SNPs include polymorphisms in the <em>KLB</em> gene, as well as in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster. In the latter, different variations of genes differently influence the metabolism of alcohol. In the case of tobacco use, the most evident variations have been detected in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes cluster.</p>
<p>However, only a small number of common genetic variants have been studied, and they account for a modest proportion of alcohol and nicotine addiction heritability. Thus, further investigation into the role of low frequency and rare genetic variants is required in order to fully understand the heritability of both alcohol and tobacco use.</p>
<h1><font size="6">In Sum<p></p>
<h1><font size="6"><p></p>
<p>Considering all of these facts together, it seems that genetics does indeed play an important role in the development of addiction to substances such as opioids, alcohol, and tobacco. Some of these factors include differences in gene expression and gene variants in brain neurotransmitter pathways. Further research is needed in order to develop working strategies for treating heritable addictions.</p>

<p><i>That which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger…</i> It’s an adage that’s backed up in part by studies of people who’ve been through a trauma, such as a car accident or a robbery. While it’s true that around 7-8 per cent of trauma survivors develop chronic PTSD and experience persistent intrusive, unwanted memories of the event, most people recover quickly, and some even report better mental health than they had before (generally when the trauma has been moderate, rather than severe). But what underpins so-called “post-traumatic growth?” A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-34715-001">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>, argues that it has to do with trauma triggering a form of mental training that increases some survivors’ control over their own minds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34585"></span></p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that traumatic experiences – as horrible as they may be – might naturally contribute to the adaptation of cognitive control skills, thereby improving survivors’ later resilience, at least [for] those who experienced only moderate levels of trauma,” write Justin Hulbert at Bard College, US, and Michael Anderson at the University of Cambridge. If these researchers are right, there could be implications for the treatment of PTSD.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two studies, each of 48 students, suggested that those who had experienced a relatively high number of traumas (including witnessing or experiencing accidents, violence, and the death of significant individuals) before the age of 18 showed a greater ability to inhibit, when instructed, their memories of a word pairing they had previously learned, compared with those who reported no or little trauma.</p>
<p>The participants initially viewed a set of 60 word pairs, which consisted of a neutral cue word (such as “violin”) and either a neutral or a negative response word (such as “street” or “corpse”). They were given up to three training cycles to correctly recall at least half of the response words. Next, they were given a series of “Think/No Think” trials. If a cue word was presented on the screen in green, they had to say the response word as quickly as possible. But if the cue word appeared in red, they were told to avoid both thinking about and saying the response word for the next four seconds. Then came some surprise recall tests. This time they were given either the original cue word, or a new semantic cue plus the initial letter of the response word – such as “anatomy c_____” for “corpse”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hulbert and Anderson found that while those in the high and low trauma groups were equally good at learning the initial word associations, those in the high trauma group showed superior performance on the subsequent “No Think” trials, indicating they had a “robust ability” to forget the specific response words when required to do so. This held for both neutral and negative words, “suggesting that this effect reflects a generalised skill at suppression, regardless of valence,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data is consistent with the idea that experiencing trauma – at least for this group of people who successfully made it to university – may encourage resilience by training the ability to inhibit unwanted memories, in particular, and perhaps even a general inhibitory control mechanism, which could extend to unwanted emotions and actions, Hulbert and Anderson propose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If these new findings are reliable – and obviously the study requires that we trust the students’ self-reports of their history of trauma – then they could have implications for how to optimise CBT treatments for trauma. Standard cognitive-behavioural therapy for PTSD encourages patients to confront reminders of their experience and the memories that are triggered by them – the idea being that over time this exposure will lead the traumatic memories to become less distressing. However, Hulbert and Anderson believe their results suggest that while it is important not to avoid reminders of the trauma, it may actually be beneficial to practice suppressing the memories that are triggered by them (mirroring what seems to happen naturally for people who experience post-traumatic growth). “Training in retrieval suppression may augment the benefits of cognitive-behavioural therapy,” Hulbert and Anderson write, “by enabling patients to confront reminders and redirect to more benign thoughts.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>People who do not recover well from a trauma and who develop chronic PTSD may perhaps have general deficits in inhibitory control, or an impaired ability to adapt control mechanisms over time, perhaps in part because of a genetic variation in cortical plasticity, Hulbert and Anderson suggest. However, the new results suggest that “… for many victims living with trauma, efforts to achieve emotional balance by down-regulating intrusive thoughts may act as a natural form of cognitive training.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

We offer end-to-end highly customized solutions for genetics to the biomedical research community. Our next generation RNA silencing products powered by FANA antisense technology enable researchers and scientists to solve problems and conduct basic, translational and preclinical research, while significantly advancing their efforts towards drug discovery and development.</span></p><p><b>Many biotech companies in this space offer similar RNA silencing and gene editing services, but they employ different tools. How are you different?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key difference in our research tools is self-delivery and the mode of action. Further, our next generation FANA – ASO technology can work both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vitro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a wide range of study models and can be used to silence or regulate RNA modalities like mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA with high specificity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conventional technologies have some key limitations that lead to longer discovery and development times. We have seen that many times researchers need to change (or significantly optimize) their RNA silencing technologies (and research toolset) when they advance their study models, especially from cell lines to primary cells to animal studies. Significant optimization is required at each stage. This sometimes means that they need to start from square one and spend more time on R&amp;D. AUM’s FANA technology offers a very unique class of RNA silencing products that can be used both for cellular and animal work in a wide spectrum of study models (including bacterial and viral models) with a very easy to use single step rapid protocol. FANAs can help shorten the time of both drug discovery and development and ultimately help save lives.</span></p><p><b>You’ve got my attention. Can you elaborate more on FANA ASO such as what is it and how it works?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FANA ASO technology works at the genetic level and helps understand the function and role of genes in a wide spectrum of study models. We achieve this by our next generation FANA technology which is a 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-beta-D-arabinose sugar modification on single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides that can be used for RNA silencing and regulation experiments. As opposed to the RNAi pathway (involving RISC) FANA single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides use RNase H-mediated cleavage. This mode of mRNA knockdown is simpler than siRNA mediated knockdown and eliminates RISC-associated off-target effects often observed with siRNA. FANA oligos can target both cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA targets. FANAs have a very high binding affinity and specificity for their RNA targets and can be used to knockdown mRNA and/or lncRNA (using RNase H mode of action) or act as steric blockers (miRNA inhibition, inhibition of translation or exon skipping). Additionally and importantly, FANA ASOs can also be used to regulate bacterial and viral RNA targets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our RNA silencing FANA technology, we can shut down or regulate any gene of interest and it can be used to understand the underlying mechanistic principles and biology of a disease. The technology can also be used to understand different pathways and networks of genes and for genome-wide high throughput screens. Further, FANAs can be used for target discovery. FANAs can be self-delivered both in cellular and preclinical study models and most importantly, can be developed as a drug.</span></p><p><b>I see. How is this technology different from other alternatives such as CRISPR, siRNA, and shRNA?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending upon experimental needs, scientists always have the option to choose the right technology that can best solve their problems. Not many of these conventional technologies can achieve self-delivery and the use of transfection reagents can sometimes be toxic to cells, especially when you are working with primary cells. With FANAs you do not need transfection reagents. Simply add the FANAs to the cells and that is it. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, some of these conventional technologies you mention are also known to have off-target effects.  Due to the next generation chemical modifications, FANA ASOs are highly sequence specific, potent and stable. These attributes are very important to understand the true biology of a disease model and will benefit the biomedical scientific community immensely. This will also save time, money and resources. Lastly, FANAs also have a much simpler mode of action.</span></p><p><b>Does this mean that I do not need transfection or delivery reagents to knockdown an RNA target?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. A key advantage of FANA ASO technology is its ability to be self-delivered without the use of delivery (transfection) reagents or formulations. Further, FANA ASOs can be used for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">difficult-to-transfect primary cells including immune cells (like PBMCs, T cells, B cells, macrophages), neuronal cells, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">endothelial cells</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to name a few.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, FANAs can be self-delivered to very sensitive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary cells from diseased donors, and silence the desired RNA, which can accurately mimic the biology of the disease. More importantly, FANA ASOs can also be used for preclinical studies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and target various regions of the body via multiple routes of administration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><b>CRISPR has been in the news in the last couple of years. How does your technology compare with CRISPR?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one technology can solve all the problems in the world.  Gene editing using CRISPR is an amazing technology but like any other technology, it has some limitations. For example, CRISPR products need delivery reagents, optimization and may have longer protocols. Recently, off-target effects are also reported in some cases with CRISPR. FANA ASOs can be self-delivered without the use of any delivery agent. Furthermore, FANAs ASOs are made of next-generation chemical modifications that enhance chemical and intracellular stability, as well as binding with the target RNA. FANA technology also provides high fidelity for the RNA target and can work seamlessly across a wide spectrum of study models. Ultimately, which technology to choose will depend upon the specific needs of the researcher and we strongly believe that FANA technology can get the job done very efficiently. </span></p><p><b>What does your customer base look like?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are blessed with a growing customer base. AUM BioTech’s genetic research products are now being globally used in several countries spread over 5 continents by researchers in academic labs, non-profit organizations, government research institutes, and biotech/pharmaceutical companies from startups all the way to world-leading organizations.</span></p><p><b>How has your partnership with Science Exchange been</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange is a leading platform that connects researchers with innovative products and companies like AUM BioTech. AUM’s newly formed partnership with Science Exchange holds significant promise. We strongly believe that by collaborating with Science Exchange we will be able to reach out to customers much more rapidly than ever before and significantly expand our customer base. We look forward to advancing global biomedical R&amp;D through this collaboration.</span></p><p><b>Before we wrap up, do you have any final message for Science Exchange users?</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUM BioTech is a company founded by innovators, scientists and creative thinkers with a mission to advance biomedical research. Just as importantly, we are very fortunate to have highly motivated team members with interdisciplinary skill sets who work very hard every day to solve problems. We understand the complexities of biomedical research.  Working with us, Science Exchange users will not only get exceptional genetic research tools but also extraordinary customer service with technical support. We just don’t sell products, we also help users throughout their experiments whenever needed. We really like doing that as this helps us understand the key problems (and troubleshoot where required) which allows us to offer customized solutions specific to their needs. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to solve users’ problems and make their research a success.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/fhbBFBkj6QA/">PLOS Update</a></h4>

<p>In 2009, we launched <em>PLOS Currents </em>as an experimental platform for rapid communication of non-standard publications. A few communities embraced the experiment enthusiastically from the start, and the contributions of researchers who volunteered as editors and reviewers was fantastic. Over the years, we have seen important applications, for example, in small communities collaborating on rare diseases research in <em>PLOS Currents Huntington Disease</em>, and in rapid communication of preliminary results in the context of disease outbreaks in <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks</em>. In particular, there was a surge of submissions during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak.</p>
<p>However, in recent years the technology supporting this platform has aged rapidly, the user experience has been subpar, and submissions have substantially decreased. We have undertaken a thorough review to understand these concerns, and to evaluate whether <em>PLOS Currents</em> was still meeting our original aims – and the needs of its communities. Our conclusion: it does not. Much has changed in the years since <em>Currents’</em> launch and we think there are now better ways of serving the original aims. We have therefore made the difficult announcement to cease its publication.</p>
<p>From today, <em>PLOS Currents</em> will no longer accept new submissions. Authors who currently have a submission under review have been contacted with details on their options going forward. All <em>PLOS Currents</em> content will remain available, citable, indexed in PubMed and permanently archived on the <em>PLOS Currents</em> site and publicly archived in PubMed Central.</p>
<p>In assessing how <em>PLOS Currents</em> measured against its original vision we learned three major lessons and a new path forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite the flexibility of the format and invitations to submit wide-ranging research (e.g., negative results, single experiments, research in progress, protocols, datasets, etc.), the majority of submissions to <em>PLOS Currents</em> were traditional research articles</li>
<li>The platform which underlies <em>PLOS Currents</em> has not evolved as rapidly with the needs of the community it was meant to serve.</li>
<li>A common thread has been the desire to publish rapidly, which was particularly obvious in the case of <em>PLOS Currents Disasters</em> and <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks.</em> However, since <em>PLOS Currents</em> was launched new publishing tools have emerged that can facilitate the rapid sharing of work.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have partnered with like-minded organizations to provide more adapted and specialized solutions. Today we offer the option for rapid dissemination across all of our journals through our <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent partnership with the preprint server bioRxiv</a>.  We have also partnered with other platforms that specialize in specific content types such as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">protocols.io</a>, an open access repository for laboratory protocols, with customized features for protocols publication, execution, adaptation, and discussion. Through a series of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preferred repositories</a> that host specialist dataset and our close collaboration with <a href="https://datadryad.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dryad</a> and<a href="https://figshare.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> figshare</a>, PLOS champions the sharing of data sets according to the FAIR principles.</p>
<p>We continue to seek partnerships to facilitate the dissemination of research outputs that do not conform to the traditional research article mold. Meanwhile, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a> has reinforced its commitment to continue to publish negative results and replication and confirmation studies.</p>
<p>To bring together all these features, we have built <a href="https://channels.plos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Channels</a>, which integrate content from all PLOS titles, the wider literature, preprint servers, blogs, and the other content platforms types described above. Channel Editors curate this content to create a highly-valuable community resource, developed and maintained by communities for communities. By extending beyond a single title or platform for original content, we believe that Channels are well suited to build on the initial objectives of <em>PLOS Currents.</em></p>
<p>For example, last year, we launched a <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disease Forecasting &amp; Surveillance Channel</a> to which one of the Editors of <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks</em> and a member of our Currents review board already contribute. In May, as the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo worsened, we rapidly <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/plos-responds-to-ebola-outbreak-with-new-channel-expedited-peer-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched an Ebola Channel</a> to serve responders. When the WHO announced the end of the outbreak, we paused activity on the Channel but stand ready to activate it, or another channel, as researchers and clinicians mobilize to fight outbreaks as they occur. These are only two examples of the potential we see for Channels to support specific communities.</p>
<p>The initial objectives of <em>PLOS Currents</em> remain vibrantly alive at PLOS and we are enormously grateful to all the <em>PLOS Currents</em> Editors and Reviewers, past and present, who have made this experiment possible. We will continue to work with these communities to find new ways to facilitate communication of research that fit their specific needs.</p>

<p>The last time you and your class-mates or co-workers pulled an all-nighter before a deadline, you may have noticed:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>there are always those lucky individuals who seem to do just fine after a lack of sleep, while others feel drowsy and confused – almost like they had too much to drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>New research conducted at the German Aerospace Center suggests this could be because alcohol intoxication and sleep deprivation are more similar than we once thought.</p>
<p>In their study <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/10/1803770115">published recently in PNAS</a>, Eva-Maria Elmenhorst and David Elmenhorst and their colleagues show how both affect us via a shared mechanism. And what’s more, if you’re sensitive to one, you’re likely to cope poorly with the other as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-34569"></span></p>
<p>The researchers tested the ability of 49 healthy volunteers to sustain their attention over a long period of time. The tests took place on four different days, under different conditions: baseline, after drinking alcohol, and after either partial or full sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Sustained attention was measured as reaction time on the 10-minute Psychomotor Vigilance Task, in which participants had to press a button as fast as possible in response to a randomly occurring light that appeared on-screen. On test days the task was repeated every 3 hours.</p>
<p>For the alcohol condition, the volunteers had to drink enough vodka to reach a blood alcohol level of at least 0.06 per cent – over the drink drive limit for most European countries. Some participants even reached levels of almost 0.1 per cent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When the researchers then looked at how much the participants’ reaction times were slowed down by alcohol compared to baseline, they saw big differences between them. But crucially, this wasn’t explained by the level of alcohol in their blood. Some participants with the highest alcohol levels had almost no impairments, while others closer to the lower limit had much slower reaction times. You may have witnessed a similar phenomenon with your friends. Even though you’ve all had the same amount of drinks, some can have a perfectly normal conversation, while others can’t even build a clear sentence.</p>
<p>The researchers then split the group into two – those with low or high sensitivity to alcohol – to see if the same groups would be more or less sensitive to sleep deprivation as well.</p>
<p>Indeed, after either 35 hours of total sleep deprivation or 4 successive five-hour nights, the participants most adversely affected by lack of sleep were also the ones who had been most sensitive to alcohol.</p>
<p>On a molecular level, this similarity in response to alcohol and sleep deprivation had previously been shown in animal models and cell cultures. Both alcohol and sleep deprivation affect the adenosine system, which could help explain the performance differences between participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Adenosine is a molecule formed during normal energy metabolism and which accumulates in the brain through the day. By binding to its receptors, of which the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor is the most common, adenosine makes us sleepy. When we are sleep deprived, more of these receptors become available on cell surfaces, thus giving adenosine more binding sites, which makes us even more sensitive to the molecule.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, alcohol increases the concentration of adenosine and thereby induces sleepiness. But what hadn’t been shown before this study is how alcohol affects the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor in the human brain. By using a kind of brain scanning called positron emission tomography (PET) with more volunteers, the researchers showed that alcohol, like sleep deprivation, increases the availability of A<sub>1 </sub>adenosine receptors, in a similar way to sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>This study therefore provides evidence that alcohol and sleep deprivation affect the adenosine system in very similar ways, and that personal differences in this system likely contribute to the way our sensitivity or resilience to both manifests as an individual trait (although the full picture is more complicated – sensitivity to alcohol, for example, is known to depend on a number of factors and has been linked to several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4037586/">genetic variations</a>).</p>
<p>Though these results are important, they have several limitations. The volunteers underwent more experimental conditions than included in the key analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation and alcohol intoxication. In fact they spent a total of 12 days in the sleep laboratory, including an adaptation night and other challenges, including exposure to air low in oxygen or alcohol followed by partial sleep deprivation. Although these conditions were always followed by recovery nights, there may have been some carry-over effects that influenced the currently discussed results.</p>
<p>The study samples were also relatively small and uneven (for instance, of the 47 volunteers from the total sleep-deprivation group, 12 could not complete the alcohol condition, and only 14 participants completed the partial sleep deprivation condition). The results should be replicated using bigger samples to confirm that sensitivity to alcohol and sleep deprivation is a true individual trait.</p>
<p>Moreover, although sustained attention is a key function, it would also be interesting to look at other cognitive functions next. If the individual trait “sensitivity to alcohol and sleep deprivation” exists, does it also affect abilities like memory or problem-solving? These measures would give us a deeper understanding of how volunteers will cope with their daily tasks after having a drink or a short night.</p>
<p>As a first step for yourself, it could be useful to be more aware of how your body reacts to alcohol and sleep deprivation, and especially to consider if you are sensitive to both. For example, if you’re the kind of person who wouldn’t dare give an important presentation, or drive a car, even after just a single, weak drink (because you know your own sensitivity to alcohol), this is a good indicator that you probably shouldn’t undertake such challenges after a short night either. Taking sleep seriously can be hard, given that external pressures and stress cannot always be influenced. But being aware of the full impact of sleep deprivation can be an important first step for a healthier lifestyle.</p>

<p>Recently, Science Exchange spoke with Joshua Carter, PhD, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/helix-biostructures-llc">Helix BioStructures</a>, about the increasing demand for outsourced structural data collection services, particularly for R&amp;D teams pursuing structure-based drug design projects. Helix BioStructures is a contract research organization (CRO) specializing in fast and efficient structure biology services.</p>
<h3><b>Structural Data Collection: 16+ Hour Shifts, 10 Crystals Per Hour</b></h3>
<p>Thanks to advances in rational drug design, the demand for x-ray crystal structures is higher than ever. Parallel advances in automated crystal screening, remote access to beamlines, faster data collection, and improved phasing/structure solution methods have yielded steady increases in the number of structures solved per year.</p>
<p>Even though structural data collection is faster today than in the past (~10-12 crystals per hour in 2017, compared to ~4 crystals per hour in 2007), data collection remains a demanding task.</p>
<p>“Data collection shifts require a scientist to be attentive for 16+ hours (usually overnight) and be able to multitask continuously while recognizing details correlated to the experiment,” describes Carter.</p>
<h3><b>Reasons for Outsourcing Structural Data Collection</b></h3>
<p>Given the demanding aspects of the task, companies outsource structural data collection for multiple reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cost savings: Compared to the cost of an internal full-time employee dedicated to structural data collection, it can be cost-effective to outsource this role to an experienced provider.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand access to synchrotrons: Because Helix BioStructures does not require minimum sample numbers, customers can send crystal samples as soon as they harvest them.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Speed: Customers can expect high quality data within 1-1.5 weeks.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Expertise: CRO scientists, such as the Helix BioStructures team, have a breadth and depth of experience in structural data collection unattainable by most researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our customers get my expertise of nine full years of industrial data collection,” promises Carter.</p>
<h3><b>Critical Decisions During Structural Data Collection</b></h3>
<p>Carter’s description of data collection, requiring absolute attention and real-time, complex decisions (possibly on little sleep), illustrates why having years of experience can be essential for quality data.</p>
<p>“Not only are we continuously interpreting diffraction quality and characteristics on the fly, but we are simultaneously determining experimental parameters for data collection that will allow us to achieve the highest quality data possible,” he explains.</p>
<p>In addition to data quality, the team are experts in recognizing and solving frequent beamline malfunctions. They are constantly on the lookout for robot failures, beam misalignment, and user interface errors.</p>
<h3><b>Use Case: Solving A Membrane Protein Structure From Incomplete Data</b></h3>
<p>Helix BioStructures has performed very complex data collection experiments for major R&amp;D organizations, including one study involving a challenging membrane protein.</p>
<p>The team used their expertise to effectively mesh-scan the LCP (lipidic cubic phase) crystallization drop, find the most intensely diffracting crystals, and collect multiple data sets for the target of interest.</p>
<p>“Since this was a membrane target, we were faced with radiation damage leading to incomplete data sets,” recalled Carter. “But using my knowledge of various programs, I was able to combine the data sets for data reduction and successfully merge for a complete data set that was statistically sound.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>There’s a popular idea in psychology that among the important factors shaping our honesty and generosity is our belief in the concept of free will. Believe more strongly in free will, so the theory goes, and you will be more inclined to prosocial behavior. Supporting this, studies that have momentarily undermined people’s belief in free will – for instance, by giving them a text to read about genetic determinism, or about how neuroscience shows our decisions are out of conscious control – have found that this increases people’s propensity for <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed">cheating</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208327217">selfishness</a>.</p>
<p>Such an effect seems understandable – after all, the notion that humans can choose whether to behave well or badly is fundamental to how we think about moral responsibility. It’s plausible that if you portray free will as an illusion then you provide people with a ready-made excuse for bad, selfish behavior, thus increasing the temptation for them to act that way.</p>
<p>As ever, however, reality is refusing to conform to a simple, intuitively appealing story. Recent attempts to replicate the influence of changing people’s free will beliefs on their subsequent moral behavior <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10372-009">have failed</a>, or have applied <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173193">only to specific groups</a> of people, but not others.</p>
<p>Now a series of four large studies conducted on Amazon’s survey website, each involving hundreds of people, has failed to find a correlation between people’s beliefs about free will and either their generosity toward charities or their inclination to cheat. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618780732">Writing up their findings</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, Damien Crone and Neil Levy at the University of Melbourne and Macquarie University said “… we believe there is good reason to doubt that free will beliefs have any substantial implications for everyday moral behaviors.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34552"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked their participants to complete two different comprehensive measures of their beliefs in free will, then gave them the opportunity to share some of their profits from a financial game with charities of their choice. The studies also included a measure of how central the participants saw virtuous traits as being to their identity. And in an online dice game, there was a chance to cheat secretly to earn a larger financial bonus.</p>
<p>Across all four studies, people who believed more strongly in free will were no more generous (if anything there was a trend in the other direction, toward less generosity), and cheated just as often. On the other hand, seeing virtuous traits as more central to one’s identity <em>was</em> associated with more prosocial behavior – suggesting the outcome measures were sensitive enough to detect meaningful associations in the data.</p>
<p>The new studies aren’t perfect, of course – for example, there are lots of other ways that one could conceptualize moral behavior – and should be seen as adding more detail to our understanding of this interesting area of inquiry, rather than shutting it down.</p>
<p>But in the context of the recent failed attempts to replicate the moral consequences of momentarily undermining belief in free will, the new findings do give reason to question the claims of those psychologists and commentators who have already <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/">raised the alarm</a> rather loudly about the potential adverse effects for society of disseminating scientific findings that challenge the concept of human free will. As Crone and Levy conclude, “more research is required before actively discouraging free-will skepticism out of fear of moral degeneration.”</p>

<p>What do <a href="http://www.marianarickmann.com">parents who also happen to be scientists (like me)</a> do when faced with a subject they know nothing about but affects their lives directly? We research!</p>
<p>However, I found very little information about early child development that was evidence-based enough to satisfy me, and at the same time simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>So, I decided to write myself the article<em> I</em> was looking for!</p>
<p>I started with a bit of research about the scientific facts supporting early childhood education and childcare. Being a new mom I had no idea of what I was doing, and the scientist in me needed evidence.</p>
<p>I was curious because our girls go to a daycare with a specific non-traditional approach, and also because neurobiology is so fascinating to me.</p>

<p>In this blog for Your Brain Health, I summarise 10 neuroscience facts I’ve learned about early child development, and how to help young brains flourish and become resilient.</p>
<h2>Fact 1: During the first years of life children’s brains grow faster than at any other period</h2>
<p><strong>Early brain development sets the foundations for emotion, memory and decision-making in adulthood.</strong></p>
<p>The brain of a newborn has nearly as many neurons as an adult brain. During the first few years of life, infant’s and children’s brain undergo massive restructuration of their neural networks, new neurons are born, and new connections sprout and existing connections are refined.</p>
<p>Around age 3, children have twice as many synapses (neuronal connections) as an adult; some will remain throughout adulthood but others will be gradually eliminated during late childhood and adolescence according to the unique experiences each child has.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support brain development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the child the chance to participate in daily activities according to each child’s age; for example, helping to prepare food, cleaning or personal hygiene.</li>
<li>Encourage children to have a close relationship with nature.</li>
<li>Give them the time to engage and repeat the activity of their choice. This allows their brain to rest on the experiences that are more important for them in the moment.</li>
<li>Don’t expect children to spend long periods of time sitting down. Give children the freedom to move around the class.</li>
<li>Give children time to explore: this is called free play. They can decide what material and activity they will use.</li>
<li>Children learn with their hands; they enjoy touching the toys or materials. This way of learning is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O2wm1pUGZ0">hands-on experience</a>. The brain is receiving information from all senses, and this is how brains develop and understand the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: The brain develops by having experiences: give the child space and time to experiment.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“You can’t make children grow faster by pushing them, just as you can’t make flowers grow faster by pulling them.” Otto Weininger</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 2: Sensitive periods are critical for learning and refining cognitive functions</h2>
<p>Our brain goes through during periods of intense development known as critical periods. Most occur in infancy, but some arrive as late as the teenage years. During critical periods, brains rapidly develop abilities such as vision, language and social skills. Experience in the form of sensory input — vision, sound and so on — is needed to form new synapses, strengthen existing connections, prune superfluous dendrites, and add more myelin when faster communication is required.</p>
<p>Critical periods are when the brain not only uses but absolutely <em>requires</em> sensory experiences to remodel and refine the neural circuits.</p>
<p><strong>Myelination is related to sensitive periods</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V7RZwDpmXE">Myelin</a> coats and insulates axons and helps neurons conduct signals efficiently, which in turn helps the brain perform complex tasks. Myelinated axons conduct information 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons (which means quicker thinking).</p>
<p>The process of myelination is the last step in the maturation of the neuronal network: is the brain’s way of saying: “This skill is important in the world around me, I need to pay attention to this”.</p>
<p>Babies are born with few myelinated axons. As the baby grows, the extent of <strong>myelination is based on experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experiences and repetition</strong>, especially during the sensitive periods, are critical to establish more efficient connections and support the healthy development of the brain.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support sensitive periods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let each child engage in what interests her most at each moment.</li>
<li>Give the child the time to repeat the activity and help only when needed.</li>
<li>Don’t expect all children to learn at the same rate.</li>
<li>Teachers and carers should observe the child and guide each of them according to each child’s interests.</li>
<li>Provide a safe and prepared environment that is filled with interesting age-related activities, and where the child has the freedom to explore without interruption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Observe the child to spot a sensitive period and provide according to her interests (not yours).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: What happens if a child misses a sensitive period?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Neuroscientific research has identified that children facing deprivation or a lack of stimulation in particular areas during sensitive periods for development will have a deficit in that particular area of brain function. However, research has also supported the idea of plasticity in the brain. Given that the human brain can adapt and even produce new neurons over its lifespan, learning and a strengthening of connections within the human brain occur throughout one’s lifespan.” Blakemore &amp; Frith, 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>So missing out on appropriate experiences within sensitive periods means harder work to learn a skill later in life. <strong>Is like learning a language when you are older</strong>; you can still do it, but it may require a bit (or a lot) more of effort.</p>
<p>For example, during the first months of life, babies recognise sounds related to all languages, but by the end of the first year, they remember only the ones related to the languages they are exposed to.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because low-level circuits mature early and high-level circuits mature later, different kinds of experiences are critical at different ages for optimal brain development, a concept called age-appropriate experience. Soon after birth, basic sensory, social, and emotional experiences are essential for optimizing the architecture of low-level circuits. At later ages, more sophisticated kinds of experiences are critical for shaping higher-level circuits.” National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>More importantly, in not stressful or traumatic environments, where the child is loved and accepted, it is improbable that she will not get the inputs she needs for healthy brain development.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 3: Executive functions develop alongside maturation of the prefrontal cortex</h2>
<p><strong>The pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is the area of the brain behind the forehead. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive functions of the PFC include self-control, attention, problem-solving, planning, reasoning, creativity and flexibility. These functions </strong><strong>develop exponentially in the pre-school years. </strong></p>
<p>All activities that have social, emotional and physical ingredients train executive functions.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments encourage executive functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children usually can´t sit still. This is because the ‘top-down’ ability to inhibit movement develops alongside other executive functions.</li>
<li>Several studies support the interdependency between narrative skills and executive functions. Children get to practice attention, focus and resist distraction when listening to a story. Similarly, those skills help a child construct a story on their own, from pictures or ideas.</li>
<li>In some daycare classrooms where there is only one material or toy or play with, children need to be patient and wait for their turn: in doing so they practice self-control.</li>
<li>In most group activities, physical movement is linked with a sense of belonging, for example, a walk in the forest or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYBdRW-NOzM">walking on the line</a> in a group.</li>
<li>Several materials developed by <a href="https://montessori.org.au/biography-dr-maria-montessori" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr Maria Montessori</a> (a childhood educator) train the executive functions. For example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJNtEndiXQg">binomial cube</a> is excellent for developing flexible thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: activities with social, emotional and physical components like martial arts, dance, theatre or circus groups are a right way of training executive functions. Go out for a walk or a bike ride with your child!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“School readiness and learning achievement across the content areas and grades rely on Executive Function processes, which is why these skills should be promoted and trained in early childhood programs and schools”. Sabine Kubesch and colleagues, 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 4: Stress affects brain development and executive functions</h2>
<p><strong>Prolonged adversity in the absence of a caring adult disrupts healthy brain development.</strong></p>
<p>The PFC is very sensitive to stress, as well as sleep deprivation, sadness, loneliness or being physically unfit.</p>
<p>While <strong>positive stress</strong> (like meeting a new adult, or a new environment) is an important and necessary aspect of healthy development, <strong>chronic toxic stress</strong> caused by extreme situations (like poverty, abuse or severe maternal depression) adversely affects the healthy development of the brain.</p>
<p>One primary stress sources in children and young adults during the school years is the focus on achieving high grades and qualifications. Children worry about <strong>not being smart enough and not succeeding in school or life</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How children can bypass the stress related to learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The inner motivation to learn is more rewarding than learning to pass an exam, and in many cases gives better academic results. Ideally, the principal objective of education should be to encourage curiosity and independent learning, not grades.</li>
<li>Children should not be expected to perform in a standardised way. Every child learns on her rhythm and interests.</li>
<li>Each child should be respected as she is, and her interests should be acknowledged and encouraged.</li>
<li>Chaos is a source of stress. Classrooms and spaces that are beautiful, not overloaded and kept in order are calming to the senses and thus helps diminish stress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always encourage an effort-mentality to approach goals. More than achievements, effort should be praised. Always tell your child: you do not know how to do it, <em>yet</em>. But you will do, with practice. Invariably discipline your child from a loving and calm perspective.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Adverse caregiving experiences can affect brain structures and function, and these may in turn impact on psychological and emotional development.” McCrory and Viding, 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 5: Mirror neurons help a child learn by imitation</h2>
<p><strong>Watching an activity has almost the same effect on the brain as doing it.</strong></p>
<p>This means that the brain learns by watching, it is part of the preparation to perform the activity.</p>
<p>In brain scanning images, researchers found that the same areas of the brain were active in the person that was doing the activity as well as in the person watching it.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons exist in the premotor cortex of monkey, but neuroscientists are <a class="ext" href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/breaking-news-is-this-first-ever-direct.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still trying to find out whether they exist in humans</a>, where they are, and what exactly it is they do. Mirror neurons are fascinating but we’re only in the early stages of learning about their role in learning.</p>
<p>Role patterns have a significant implication for a child’s development. Children learn by reproducing what they see. Their brain is getting ready to replicate what they observed.</p>
<p><strong>How mirror neurons might be in action during early child development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some daycare facilities, children are welcome to watch other children as they work with any material or activity. Since there is (usually) only one or a few units of a material of each kind when they want to use it, and it is not free at the moment, they need to wait, but they can watch while the other child uses it.</li>
<li>Parents, caregivers, teachers or facilitators are crucial as a role model for the child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Be the adult you want your child to become.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 6: Working memory lays the foundation for more complex functions like language</h2>
<p><strong>Working memory is a temporary note in the brain, like the instructions for baking a cake that you forget afterwards.</strong></p>
<p>Also considered one of the brain’s executive functions, working memory is the ability to process new information that a child needs for performing a task, like following a series of steps.</p>
<p><strong>How to train working memory</strong></p>
<p>Several materials and activities specially designed for children require that the child uses her working memory. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matching colour tablets at a distance by keeping the requested colour in mind.</li>
<li>Retrieving a specified quantity of beads from across the room based on only verbal instructions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7BM7KDUzI">constructive triangle exercises.</a></li>
<li>Any matching game like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFibQyVimh8">colour box</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Give the child short instructions and time to follow them on her own.</strong></p>

<h2>Fact 7: Cognition is linked to movement.</h2>
<p><strong>Learning is not only a brain activity, learning is a whole-body task.</strong></p>
<p>Movement is controlled in the brain by the motor cortex together with many other regions, through connections that develop as a child moves and explores her world. This explains why children who get less opportunity to move, show poor school readiness.</p>
<p>“It’s truly astonishing that the dominant model for formal learning is still “sit and git.” It’s not just astonishing; it’s embarrassing.” Eric Jensen</p>

<li>Give the child activities that require hands-on manipulation of the materials. The learning experience is practical.</li>
<li>Understand that learning is an active, enjoyable task with direct physical experience.</li>
<li>Understand that there are biological reasons why it is complicated for a child to sit and listen.</li>
<li>Children need time to explore and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVpPMOhPgJI">freedom of movement in a prepared environment.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Children and babies need the freedom to move. Give them opportunities and be prepared if you are in a situation where they won’t be able to run, escalate and jump. Understand it is a physical and developmental need, not misbehaviour.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“The child’s intelligence can develop to a certain level without the help of his hand. But if it develops with his hand, then the level that it reaches is higher, and the child’s character is stronger.” Dr Maria Montessori</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 8: Each brain is unique</h2>
<p><strong>Even identical twins are different.</strong></p>
<p>Experiences, nutrition, relationships <em>and</em> genes shape the brain of a child. Even the neurons of identical twins have variations due to genetic processes like “<a href="https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v306/n3/box/scientificamerican0312-26_BX1.html">jumping genes</a>” that modify the inherited genes and their expression. Genetic changing events like this are highly active in brains during development.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support the uniqueness of each child</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respect each child and encourage her interests.</li>
<li>By observation, teachers, parents and carers can learn about the needs and interests of each child, and provide accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Give each child according to her needs and interests, do not make comparisons or try to unify siblings.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Follow the child.” Dr Maria Montessori</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 9: Emotions and relationships shape the growing brain</h2>
<p><strong>Emotional well-being and social skills provide a strong foundation for developing cognitive abilities.</strong></p>
<p>Emotional, cognitive and physical capacities that develop in the early childhood years are the essential foundation for success in later adult life.</p>
<p>Emotions support the development of executive functions when they are well regulated, but interfere with them when they are out of control, impeding attention and decision-making.</p>
<p>In the long run, <strong>reduced emotional regulation in early childhood affects a child’s social capacities and the ability to adapt to school.</strong></p>
<p>The development of emotional capabilities run along with more evident skills like mobility, thinking and communication.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to a child’s emotions, and it should be considered a fundamental part of her brain development. It is impressive to see how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0">children actively react to emotional changes in their parent or carer.</a></p>
<p>In some cases, learning to manage emotions can be harder than learning to count or read, and it can even be a sign of future psychological problems.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support emotions and relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attend to each child’s feelings.</li>
<li>In classrooms with a mix of ages, children learn to respect other children by observing and taking turns.</li>
<li>Set tasks such as setting the table, dusting or keeping the classroom and bedroom tidy give the child a sense of belonging and responsibility. They learn to be useful to their family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always pay attention to all emotions. It may not be relevant to you, but it is for your child. All feelings are allowed, but not all behaviours are. Correct the action, not the emotion. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Important note: you want your child to be able to understand and explain when there is something that hurts her or that she disagrees.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Healthy development can not separate cognitive development from social and emotional development.” Jack P. Shonkoff.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 10: Creativity is the result of network brain work</h2>
<p><strong>Brains become creative when allowed to explore.</strong></p>
<p>Creativity is different from fantasy. Creativity connects seemingly non-connected concepts. Creativity is the capacity of thinking outside the box.</p>
<p>From a neuroscience perspective, the creative process is the result of many <strong>parts of the brain working together as a network.</strong> For example, similar areas of the brain get activated during musical training and mathematical processing. Early musical experiences are also a support for language development.</p>
<p>In a recent study, fMRI scans of successful engineers showed a characteristic brain activation pattern when creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://earlyarts.co.uk/blog/creativity-in-early-brain-development">creative environment during childhood</a> not only contributes to better mental health, but lays foundation for lifelong creativity.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support creativity and exploration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from one another and one’s personal experience. Give children get as much help as needed, and as little help as possible. This means they “discover” how things are done, rather than being passively told how.</li>
<li>Give freedom to explore ideas and relationships between seemingly different areas of learning or disciplines.</li>
<li>Children who learn to solve problems become independent learners.</li>
<li>In the process of discovering how things work (from an adult perspective), children come up with new applications that always surprise the adult.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always let the child do by herself what she can do alone. Do not take away from her the pleasure of discovering how the world works. Give your child real-life high-quality material to experiment.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“The most innovative entrepreneurs were very lucky to have been raised in an atmosphere where inquisitiveness was encouraged. We were struck by the stories they told about being sustained by people who cared about experimentation and exploration. Sometimes these people were relatives, but sometimes they were neighbours, teachers or other influential adults.” Hal Gregersen, in <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/how-do-innovators-think">“How do innovators think.”</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>To summarise</h2>
<p>Growing a human brain is rather like constructing a home. It starts with laying the foundations, framing the rooms, wiring the electrical system and continues with distinctive features that give the house its individuality. The foundation of a home may not be visible when you look at a house, but every part of the house depends upon it.</p>
<p>Just like a good foundation supports a secure and robust home, <strong>the first years of a child’s life shape her personality and cognitive, emotional and social skills.</strong></p>
<p>It is in our hands to understand and nurture growing minds. Research in neuroscience, cognitive development and education are providing more evidence on the importance of the first few years in a little person’s life.</p>
<p>We can learn from the current knowledge about a child early years and know that <strong>observation and respect are vital to understanding and supporting children’s growing minds</strong>. They are also the framework for healthier and happier human relationships.</p>

Each of these researchers are (or were) at the top of their fields, recipients of huge amounts of funding. They are accused of abuses of power, bullying and abuse of their subordinates and creating a climate of fear in their institutions.

A scientist's achievements are often measured in terms of the number of papers they publish (productivity) and how many citations those papers get (impact). These 'bibliometric indicators' are widely derided but they have proven remarkably stubborn.



Now, in a new preprint on bioRxiv, researchers Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström propose a new metric that, they say, could measure another important researcher characteristic: independence.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>The phrase “sexual objectification” began popping up <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=sexual+objectification&amp;year_start=1950&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%25253B%25252Csexual%252520objectification%25253B%25252Cc0">only 50 years ago</a>, but it’s now ubiquitous, reflecting our concern that seeing someone sexually amounts to perceiving them as eye candy or a piece of meat. More recently, psychologists and neuroscientists have gathered evidence that sexualisation can literally lead us to perceive people less as whole humans and more as an assemblage of parts – the same way that the mind normally processes objects.</p>
<p>But the picture is complicated by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218775690">new work</a> published in <i>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</i> from a team mainly drawn from the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Their experiments on the impact of various forms of sexualisation on the perception of the body find that objectification does not necessarily follow.</p>
<p><span id="more-34547"></span></p>
<p>This study relies on the discovery first made <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1969-12269-001">nearly 50 years ago</a> that when human faces and bodies are presented upside-down, it is particularly hard for us to perceive them in the same holistic way we do when we look at them the right-way up (a phenomenon known as the “inversion effect”). Supporting the concept of objectification, evidence from this decade shows that inverted sexualised bodies (for example, wearing scant clothing in a provocative pose) do not trigger the inversion effect, suggesting that we process them more like we process objects – by scrutinising their individual parts, rather than holistically.</p>
<p>To break down exactly what about sexualisation drives the switch from humanising to objectifying perception, Philippe Bernard and his team measured volunteers’ brainwaves, in particular looking for a negative spike in brain activity called the N170 that is known to be a marker of the inversion effect (the N170 is much larger when we view flipped human bodies versus upright ones, but shows little difference in size when we view flipped versus upright objects).</p>
<p>In their first experiment, Bernard’s team focused on an obvious way to sexualise a person, by reducing their clothing. Twenty-one participants (average age 22, and in all experiments a balance of genders, with no gendered effects observed) viewed pictures of males and females with pixellated faces wearing  black jeans and shirts or black swim-trunks/bikinis. The change in N170 caused by inverting the pictures was similar for both scantily-clad and well-covered bodies – in other words, at a neural level there was no evidence for greater objectification of the more sexualised models.</p>
<p>It was in further experiments that neural evidence of objectification emerged, once researchers introduced pictures of models engaged in sexually suggestive postures (see image above). Regardless of their amount of clothing, when the models posed suggestively inversion did not lead to a change in the N170, which means that they were being perceived more like objects.</p>
<p>Can it really be true that, without provocative posing, images showing a lot of skin did not provoke any sexualisation? While the study’s primary focus was on inversion effects, the researchers also looked at the overall size of the N170 in the different conditions because more sexualised images are known to trigger a larger N170. When the participants viewed bodies that were less clothed, particularly women’s bodies, the N170 was larger. So it seems that although seeing a lot of skin <i>doesn’t</i> objectify, it does generate sexual associations.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, suggestive posturing is a volitional act that we make in the moment, one that is intended to express “see what’s on offer”. That people respond to such invitations by checking out the wares rather than the person seems to me to reflect the response working as intended. In contrast, skin exposure need not be any kind of signal to a viewer – we expose skin when we wash, swim or stay cool (or just because we want to).  That seeing skin can rouse some sexual feeling, but doesn’t automatically make us see the person any less, seems to me to be a fairly decent and respectful way for our perceptual and cognitive architecture to be put together.</p>
<p>I should leaven this optimistic take by recognising that these actions take place in a cultural context. In the hunt for ways to titillate and capture attention, media and advertising have exploited the sexual and objectifying qualities of the provocative pose, in a way that inundates and threatens to normalise this way of viewing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, the way you pose is at your discretion, a consensual act. But where people feel pressure to actively signal sexuality, whether on Instagram or on a night out, the choice is less clearly free. And individuals who through inclination or conditioning are eager to objectify may not require suggestiveness from their target in order to do so; more work is needed to shed light on this. What this study tells us is simple: you can be seen as sexual, without being seen as an object.</p>
