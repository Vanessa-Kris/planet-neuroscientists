              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-anemone-venomous-stinger-launch-prey">Here’s how sea anemones launch their venomous stingers</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the starlet sea anemone’s stinger gets right to the point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Live-animal images and 3-D computer reconstructions have revealed the complex architecture of the tiny creature’s needlelike weapons.&nbsp;Like a harpoon festooned with venomous barbs, the stinger <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31090-0">rapidly transforms as it fires</a>, biologists Matt Gibson, Ahmet Karabulut and colleagues report June 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists can now see in exquisite detail “what this apparatus looks like before, during and&nbsp;after firing,” says Gibson, of the&nbsp;Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo.</p>





<p>In the wild, the starlet sea anemone (<em>Nematostella vectensis</em>) can live in salty lagoons or shallow estuaries, where freshwater rivers meet the sea. Its tubular body burrows into the mud, and a crown of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-sea-anemone-grows-its-tentacles">Medusa-like tentacles</a> reaches up into the water, waiting for dinner to drift by (<em>SN: 5/7/13</em>). Each tentacle is packing heat: hundreds of stingers that can mean death for brine shrimp or free-floating plankton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These stingers are among the fastest micromachines in nature. An anemone can jab a predator or nab some lunch in about a hundredth of a second, says Karabulut, also of the Stowers Institute. Scientists had an idea of how such stingers worked, but until now, had never gotten so up close and personal.</p>



<p>The researchers used fluorescent dye to see the stingers in action and scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct their three-dimensional structure. The work reveals the precise, step-by-step mechanics of the speedy shooters.</p>

<p>Packed inside a stinger’s capsule, a venomous thread coils around a central shaft.

Finally, the thread races up through the shaft, sending its barbs into an animal’s soft tissue.</p>



<p>Each stinger is good for just one shot. “It’s a one-hit wonder,” Karabulut says. “Once <em>Nematostella</em> uses it, it’s gone.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">Aliens could send quantum messages to Earth, calculations suggest</a></h4>

              
                <p>An intelligent alien civilization could beam quantum messages to Earth.</p>



<p>Particles of light, or photons, could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.123033">be transmitted over vast, interstellar distances</a> without losing their quantum nature, researchers report June 28 in <em>Physical Review D</em>. That means scientists searching for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-say-time-start-taking-search-aliens-seriously">extraterrestrial signals</a> could also look for quantum messages (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists are currently developing Earth-based <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-satellite-shatters-entanglement-record">quantum communication</a>, a technology that uses quantum particles to send information and has the potential to be more secure than standard, or classical, communication (<em>SN: 6/15/17</em>). Intelligent extraterrestrials, if they’re out there, may have also adopted quantum communication, says theoretical physicist Arjun Berera.</p>





<p>A major obstacle to quantum communication is decoherence, in which a quantum particle loses its quantumness as it interacts with its surroundings. “Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there’s any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,” Berera says.</p>



<p>Since the average density of matter in space is much less than on Earth, particles could be expected to travel farther before succumbing to decoherence. So Berera and theoretical physicist Jaime Calderón Figueroa, both of the University of Edinburgh, calculated how far light — in particular, X-rays — could travel unscathed through interstellar space.</p>



<p>X-ray photons could more than traverse the Milky Way, potentially traveling hundreds of thousands of light-years or even more, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Based on the findings, Berera and Calderón Figueroa considered strategies to search for E.T.’s quantum dispatches. One potential type of communication to search for is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-quantum-satellite-adds-two-new-tricks-repertoire">quantum teleportation</a>, in which the properties of a distant particle can be transferred to another (<em>SN: 7/7/17</em>). Since the technology requires both quantum and classical signals, scientists could look for such simultaneous signals to identify any alien quantum missives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diet-food-dementia-alzheimers-disease-research">How scientists are shifting their search for links between diet and dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The internet is rife with advice for keeping the brain sharp as we age, and much of it is focused on the foods we eat. Headlines promise that oatmeal will fight off dementia. Blueberries improve memory. Coffee can slash your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Take fish oil. Eat more fiber. Drink red wine. Forgo alcohol. Snack on nuts. Don’t skip breakfast. But definitely don’t eat bacon.</p>



<p>One recent diet study got media attention, with one headline claiming, “<a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20211111/many-people-may-be-eating-their-way-to-dementia">Many people may be eating their way to dementia</a>.” The study, published last December in <em>Neurology</em>, found that people who ate a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, beans and tea or coffee <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/97/24/e2381">had a lower risk of dementia</a> than those who ate foods that boost inflammation, such as sugar, processed foods, unhealthy fats and red meat.</p>





<p>But the study, like most research on diet and dementia, couldn’t prove a causal link. And that’s not good enough to make recommendations that people should follow. Why has it proved such a challenge to pin down whether the foods we eat can help stave off dementia?</p>



<p>First, dementia, like most chronic diseases, is the result of a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment that researchers don’t fully understand. Diet is just one factor. Second, nutrition research is messy. People struggle to recall the foods they’ve eaten, their diets change over time, and modifying what people eat — even as part of a research study — is exceptionally difficult.</p>



<p>For decades, researchers devoted little effort to trying to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia because they thought there was no way to change the trajectory of these diseases. Dementia seemed to be the result of aging and an unlucky roll of the genetic dice.</p>



<p>While scientists have identified genetic variants that boost risk for dementia, researchers now know that people can cut their risk by adopting a healthier lifestyle: avoiding smoking, keeping weight and blood sugar in check, exercising, managing blood pressure and avoiding too much alcohol — the same healthy behaviors that lower the risk of many chronic diseases.</p>



<p>Diet is wrapped up in several of those healthy behaviors, and many studies suggest that diet may also directly play a role. But what makes for a brain-healthy diet? That’s where the research gets muddled.</p>



<p>Despite loads of studies aimed at dissecting the influence of nutrition on dementia, researchers can’t say much with certainty. “I don’t think there’s any question that diet influences dementia risk or a variety of other age-related diseases,” says Matt Kaeberlein, who studies aging at the University of Washington in Seattle. But “are there specific components of diet or specific nutritional strategies that are causal in that connection?” He doubts it will be that simple.</p>



<h4>Worth trying</h4>



<p>In the United States, an estimated 6.5 million people, the vast majority of whom are over age 65, are living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Experts expect that by 2060, as the senior population grows, nearly 14 million residents over age 65 will have Alzheimer’s disease. Despite decades of research and more than 100 drug trials, scientists have yet to find a treatment for dementia that does more than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-fda-approved-controversy-aducanumab">curb symptoms temporarily</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 8</em>). “Really what we need to do is try and prevent it,” says Maria Fiatarone Singh, a geriatrician at the University of Sydney.</p>



<p>Forty percent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by modifying a dozen risk factors, according to a 2020 report commissioned by the <em>Lancet</em>. The report doesn’t explicitly call out diet, but some researchers think it plays an important role. After years of fixating on specific foods and dietary components — things like fish oil and vitamin E supplements — many researchers in the field have started looking at dietary patterns.</p>



<p>That shift makes sense. “We do not have vitamin E for breakfast, vitamin C for lunch. We eat foods in combination,” says Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and Columbia University. He led the study on dementia and anti-inflammatory diets published in <em>Neurology</em>. But a shift from supplements to a whole diet of myriad foods complicates the research. A once-daily pill is easier to swallow than a new, healthier way of eating.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where diet fits&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Up to 40 percent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by modifying 12 risk factors. Targeting some of these risks reduces nerve cell loss in the brain; other interventions protect the brain’s ability to function and adapt even if some nerve loss has occurred, a concept called cognitive reserve. Diet plays a role in at least four of these risk factors. </p>

<h4>Earning points</h4>



<p>Suspecting that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486891/">inflammation plays a role in dementia</a>, many researchers posit that an anti-inflammatory diet might benefit the brain. In Scarmeas’ study, more than 1,000 older adults in Greece completed a food frequency questionnaire and earned a score based on how “inflammatory” their diet was. The lower the score, the better. For example, fatty fish, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, was considered an anti-inflammatory food and earned negative points. Cheese and many other dairy products, high in saturated fat, earned positive points.</p>



<p>During the next three years, 62 people, or 6 percent of the study participants, developed dementia. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759053/">People with the highest dietary inflammation scores were three times as likely to develop dementia</a> as those with the lowest. Scores ranged from –5.83 to 6.01. Each point increase was linked to a 21 percent rise in dementia risk.</p>



<p>Such epidemiological studies make connections, but they can’t prove cause and effect. Perhaps people who eat the most anti-inflammatory diets also are those least likely to develop dementia for some other reason. Maybe they have more social interactions. Or it could be, Scarmeas says, that people who eat more inflammatory diets do so because they’re already experiencing changes in their brain that lead them to consume these foods and “what we really see is the reverse causality.”</p>



<p>To sort all this out, researchers rely on randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for providing proof of a causal effect. But in the arena of diet and dementia, these studies have challenges.</p>



<p>Dementia is a disease of aging that takes decades to play out, Kaeberlein says. To show that a particular diet could reduce the risk of dementia, “it would take two-, three-, four-decade studies, which just aren’t feasible.” Many clinical trials last less than two years.</p>



<p>As a work-around, researchers often rely on some intermediate outcome, like changes in cognition. But even that can be hard to observe. “If you’re already relatively healthy and don’t have many risks, you might not show much difference, especially if the duration of the study is relatively short,” says Sue Radd-Vagenas, a nutrition scientist at the University of Sydney. “The thinking is if you’re older and you have more risk factors, it’s more likely we might see something in a short period of time.” Yet older adults might already have some cognitive decline, so it might be more difficult to see an effect.</p>



<p>Many researchers now suspect that intervening earlier will have a bigger impact. “We now know that the brain is stressed from midlife and there’s a tipping point at 65 when things go sour,” says Hussein Yassine, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But intervene too early, and a trial might not show any effect. Offering a healthier diet to a 50- or 60-year-old might pay off in the long run but fail to make a difference in cognition that can be measured during the relatively short length of a study.</p>



<p>And it’s not only the timing of the intervention that matters, but also the duration. Do you have to eat a particular diet for two decades for it to have an impact? “We’ve got a problem of timescale,” says Kaarin Anstey, a dementia researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.</p>



<p>And then there are all the complexities that come with studying diet. “You can’t isolate it in the way you can isolate some of the other factors,” Anstey says. “It’s something that you’re exposed to all the time and over decades.”</p>



<h4>Food as medicine?</h4>



<p>In a clinical trial, researchers often test the effectiveness of a drug by offering half the study participants the medication and half a placebo pill. But when the treatment being tested is food, studies become much more difficult to control. First, food doesn’t come in a pill, so it’s tricky to hide whether participants are in the intervention group or the control group.</p>



<p>Imagine a trial designed to test whether the Mediterranean diet can help slow cognitive decline. The participants aren’t told which group they’re in, but the control group sees that they aren’t getting nuts or fish or olive oil. “What ends up happening is a lot of participants will start actively increasing the consumption of the Mediterranean diet despite being on the control arm, because that’s why they signed up,” Yassine says. “So at the end of the trial, the two groups are not very dissimilar.”</p>



<p>Second, we all need food to live, so a true placebo is out of the question. But what diet should the control group consume? Do you compare the diet intervention to people’s typical diets (which may differ from person to person and country to country)? Do you ask the comparison group to eat a healthy diet but avoid the food expected to provide brain benefits? (Offering them an unhealthy diet would be unethical.)</p>



<p>And tracking what people eat during a clinical trial can be a challenge. Many of these studies rely on food frequency questionnaires to tally up all the foods in an individual’s diet. An ongoing study is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480203/">assessing the impact of the MIND diet</a> (which combines part of the Mediterranean diet with elements of the low-salt DASH diet) on cognitive decline. Researchers track adherence to the diet by asking participants to fill out a food frequency questionnaire every six to 12 months. But many of us struggle to remember what we ate a day or two ago. So some researchers also rely on more objective measures to assess compliance. For the MIND diet assessment, researchers are also tracking biomarkers in the blood and urine — vitamins such as folate, B12 and vitamin E, plus levels of certain antioxidants.</p>

<h3>Weighty survey&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Lengthy food frequency questionnaires (a snapshot of some questions below) are a common tool for assessing an individual’s eating habits over time. But the accuracy of results depends on how well participants can recall what they ate and how often.</p>

</div>



<p>Another difficulty is that these surveys often don’t account for variables that could be really important, like how the food was prepared and where it came from. Was the fish grilled? Fried? Slathered in butter? “Those things can matter,” says dementia researcher Nathaniel Chin of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<p>Plus there are the things researchers can’t control. For example, how does the food interact with an individual’s medications and microbiome? “We know all of those factors have an interplay,” Chin says.</p>



<p>The few clinical trials looking at dementia and diet seem to measure different things, so it’s hard to make comparisons. In 2018, Radd-Vagenas and her colleagues looked at all the trials that had studied the impact of the Mediterranean diet on cognition. There were five at the time. “What struck me even then was how variable the interventions were,” she says. “Some of the studies didn’t even mention olive oil in their intervention. Now, how can you run a Mediterranean diet study and not mention olive oil?”</p>



<p>Another tricky aspect is recruitment. The kind of people who sign up for clinical trials tend to be more educated, more motivated and have healthier lifestyles. That can make differences between the intervention group and the control group difficult to spot. And if the study shows an effect, whether it will apply to the broader, more diverse population comes into question. To sum up, these studies are difficult to design, difficult to conduct and often difficult to interpret.</p>



<p>Kaeberlein studies aging, not dementia specifically, but he follows the research closely and acknowledges that the lack of clear answers can be frustrating. “I get the feeling of wanting to throw up your hands,” he says. But he points out that there may not be a single answer. Many diets can help people maintain a healthy weight and avoid diabetes, and thus reduce the risk of dementia. Beyond that obvious fact, he says, “it’s hard to get definitive answers.”</p>



<h4>A better way</h4>



<p>In July 2021, Yassine gathered with more than 30 other dementia and nutrition experts for a virtual symposium to discuss the myriad challenges and map out a path forward. The speakers noted several changes that might improve the research.</p>



<p>One idea is to focus on populations at high risk. For example, one clinical trial is looking at the impact of low- and high-fat diets on short-term changes in the brain in people who carry the genetic variant <em>APOE4</em>, a risk factor for Alzheimer’s. One small study suggested that a high-fat Western diet actually improved cognition in some individuals. Researchers hope to get clarity on that surprising result.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I get the feeling of wanting to throw up your hands.”</p><cite>Matt Kaeberlein</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Another possible fix is redefining how researchers measure success. Hypertension and diabetes are both well-known risk factors for dementia. So rather than running a clinical trial that looks at whether a particular diet can affect dementia, researchers could look at the impact of diet on one of these risk factors. Plenty of studies have assessed the impact of diet on hypertension and diabetes, but Yassine knows of none launched with dementia prevention as the ultimate goal.</p>



<p>Yassine envisions a study that recruits participants at risk of developing dementia because of genetics or cardiovascular disease and then looks at intermediate outcomes. “For example, a high-salt diet can be associated with hypertension, and hypertension can be associated with dementia,” he says. If the study shows that the diet lowers hypertension, “we achieved our aim.” Then the study could enter a legacy period during which researchers track these individuals for another decade to determine whether the intervention influences cognition and dementia.</p>



<p>One way to amplify the signal in a clinical trial is to combine diet with other interventions likely to reduce the risk of dementia. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability, or FINGER, trial, which began in 2009, did just that. Researchers enrolled more than 1,200 individuals ages 60 to 77 who were at an elevated risk of developing dementia and had average or slightly impaired performance on cognition tests. Half received nutritional guidance, worked out at a gym, engaged in online brain-training games and had routine visits with a nurse to talk about managing dementia risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. The other half received only general health advice.</p>



<p>After two years, the control group had a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60461-5/fulltext">25 percent greater cognitive decline than the intervention group</a>. It was the first trial, reported in the <em>Lancet </em>in 2015, to show that targeting multiple risk factors could slow the pace of cognitive decline.</p>



<p>Now researchers are testing this approach in more than 30 countries. Christy Tangney, a nutrition researcher at Rush University in Chicago, is one of the investigators on the U.S. arm of the study, <a href="https://www.alzheimers-illinois.org/wp/2021/12/20/new-phase-for-u-s-pointer-study/">enrolling 2,000 people ages 60 to 79 who have at least one dementia risk factor</a>. The study is called POINTER, or <a href="https://alz.org/us-pointer/overview.asp">U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the research — <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.055289">organizers had to pause the trial briefly</a> — but Tangney expects to have results in the next few years.</p>



<p>This kind of multi-intervention study makes sense, Chin says. “One of the reasons why things are so slow in our field is we’re trying to address a heterogeneous disease with one intervention at a time. And that’s just not going to work.” A trial that tests multiple interventions “allows for people to not be perfect,” he adds. Maybe they can’t follow the diet exactly, but they can stick to the workout program, which might have an effect on its own. The drawback in these kinds of studies, however, is that it’s impossible to tease out the contribution of each individual intervention.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Embracing complexity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To untangle the role of diet in dementia, researchers are designing trials that intervene earlier in life and last longer. Some studies combine multiple interventions, like diet, exercise and brain training, as well as measure a wider range of outcomes. </p>

<h4>Preemptive guidelines</h4>



<p>Two major reports came out in recent years addressing dementia prevention. The first, from the World Health Organization in 2019, <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550543">recommends a healthy, balanced diet for all adults</a>, and notes that the Mediterranean diet may help people who have normal to mildly impaired cognition.</p>



<p>The 2020<em> Lancet </em>Commission report, however, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext">does not include diet in its list of modifiable risk factors, at least not yet</a>. “Nutrition and dietary components are challenging to research with controversies still raging around the role of many micronutrients and health outcomes in dementia,” the report notes. The authors point out that a Mediterranean or the similar Scandinavian diet might help prevent cognitive decline in people with intact cognition, but “how long the exposure has to be or during which ages is unclear.” Neither report recommends any supplements.</p>



<p>Plenty of people are waiting for some kind of advice to follow. Improving how these studies are done might enable scientists to finally sort out what kinds of diets can help hold back the heartbreaking damage that comes with Alzheimer’s disease. For some people, that knowledge might be enough to create change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“One of the reasons why things are so slow in our field is we’re trying to address a heterogeneous disease with one intervention at a time. And that’s just not going to work.”</p><cite>Nathaniel Chin</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Inevitably, if you’ve had Alzheimer’s in your family, you want to know, ‘What can I do today to potentially reduce my risk?’ ” says molecular biologist Heather Snyder, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer’s Association.</p>



<p>But changing long-term dietary habits can be hard. The foods we eat aren’t just fuel; our diets represent culture and comfort and more. “Food means so much to us,” Chin says.</p>



<p>“Even if you found the perfect diet,” he adds, “how do you get people to agree to and actually change their habits to follow that diet?” The MIND diet, for example, suggests people eat less than one serving of cheese a week. In Wisconsin, where Chin is based, that’s a nonstarter, he says.</p>



<p>But it’s not just about changing individual behaviors. Radd-Vagenas and other researchers hope that if they can show the brain benefits of some of these diets in rigorous studies, policy changes might follow. For example, research shows that lifestyle changes can have a big impact on type 2 diabetes. As a result, many insurance providers now pay for coaching programs that help participants maintain healthy diet and exercise habits.</p>



<p>“You need to establish policies. You need to change cities, change urban design. You need to do a lot of things to enable healthier choices to become easier choices,” Radd-Vagenas says. But that takes meatier data than exist now.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/07/05/most-of-us-dont-have-a-desire-for-unlimited-wealth/">Most of us don’t have a desire for unlimited wealth</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Do humans always want more, or are we sometimes just happy with our lot? This debate has long raged in multiple disciplines: economics, politics, and even philosophy. And whether an unlimited desire for more is inherent or a product of capitalism is equally hotly contested.</p>



<p>Paul G. Bain from the University of Bath and Renata Bongiorno from Bath Spa University explore this question in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00902-y">new paper</a> published in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>. They find that the assumption we always want more, no matter how much we have, may not be completely accurate: while some of us do have unlimited desire for wealth, they are not the majority.</p>



<span id="more-47935"></span>



<p>The first study included around 2000 participants from both advanced and economically developing countries, including the US, UK, France, South Africa, China, Russia, and Brazil. As part of a larger study, participants were asked to imagine their absolutely ideal life, and to consider how much money they would want in this ideal life. They were then asked whether they wanted to enter one of eight hypothetical lotteries, each with a prize ranging from $10,000 to $100 billion. After this, participants indicated the most important change they would make with the money.</p>



<p>The second study recruited nearly 6000 participants from a wider number of countries, including from the Middle East, Africa, Central America, North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Participants in this study completed the same measures as in the first.</p>



<p>The results were similar in both studies. Relatively few participants chose the smallest values, but there was a peak between $1 million and $10 million, with a large number of participants choosing these lotteries. Interest in the larger figures then declined, with only a small number of people choosing $1 billion. But a significant number of people chose the largest, essentially “unlimited” figure of $100 billion. In the first study, for instance, 32% of Americans picked this amount, though only 8% of those from China chose this. In the second study, Indonesia had the highest proportion of participants selecting unlimited amounts at 39%, and Russia the lowest at 11%. However, it’s worth noting that although a substantial number of people did pick this “unlimited” amount of money across the studies, they were always a minority.</p>



<p>In terms of the nationality of participants, the proportion of those selecting unlimited amounts was similar across more and less developed countries, despite the fact “luxury and consumption” is encouraged in more developed countries, as the authors point out. Where there was a difference, however, was between countries where the group is prioritised over the self: participants from these countries were more likely to select the unlimited lottery than those from more individualistic nations. Younger people and those who live in cities were also more likely to select the unlimited lottery, though there was no variation by gender, class, education or political ideology.</p>



<p>When asked what they would use the money for, those who selected the unlimited lottery were  more likely to say they wanted to use their money to address social problems — perhaps why this choice was more prevalent in collectivist societies. However, the majority of these participants still stated they would use the money for themselves. When asked about their values, participants who chose the unlimited figure were also no more likely to care about the welfare of others, but did place more importance on their own personal interests.</p>



<p>The study suggests that the idea we all want unlimited resources is probably not accurate. Further research could help us pinpoint exactly what drives our desire for certain amounts of money, limited or unlimited: for instance, it would be interesting to know whether people&#8217;s views on extreme wealth and inequality influence their decisions.</p>



<p>Overall, the study’s results could help us move towards a more sustainable and less unequal way of thinking about resources and wealth. As the team writes, “normative beliefs guide behaviour even as they are inaccurate”: in other words, we sometimes fail to act on our own values because we think we are in the minority. Having limited wants, the study suggests, is normal; understanding this more thoroughly could help us consume less, even as materialistic societies encourage us to consume more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/07/04/racial-biases-shape-the-way-people-interpret-body-poses/">Racial biases shape the way people interpret body poses</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>People reliably interpret expansive poses — with the arms and legs spread and the head held high — as a signal of dominance, or power. But work to date on perceptions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc">body poses</a> has focused on White targets, note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-62512-001">new paper</a> in the J<em>ournal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em>. As research shows that Black people are often stereotyped as aggressive, hostile and threatening, might an expansive pose lead others to perceive them as being more aggressive than a White person holding their body in exactly the same way?</p>



<p>Francine Karmali at the University of Toronto and Kerry Kawakami at York University found this is indeed the case — at least for Black men. They also report evidence that this could have all kinds of impacts on a Black man’s professional and personal life.</p>



<span id="more-47930"></span>



<p>In an initial study, 111 White undergraduate students were shown photos of White and Black men in a range of settings (behind or in front of a table, for example), adopting either an expansive pose or a constrictive pose (with the limbs held close to the body). Based on their impressions from the photos alone, they rated each target for dominance, aggression, competence and warmth. The team found that, compared with constrictive poses, expansive poses got higher dominance ratings for both racial groups. However, while this higher dominance was linked to greater competence in White men, for Black men it was linked to greater competence but also more aggression.</p>



<p>The second study involved not just White but other non-Black students. They were told that they were going to see images of business school students who had just finished a summer internship and been offered paid internships for the next year — but some had got more prestigious internships with better salaries. Their task was to rate how well they thought each student had done on their summer internship assessment and to predict the salary range for their new internship. The researchers found that White and Black men in expansive poses got better ratings than those in constrictive poses — they were judged to be more successful. But this effect was significantly bigger for White targets.</p>



<p>Next, a fresh group of participants (again all non-Black) were shown a selection of the photos, and asked to choose a partner to work with on a relationship-building task. The results showed that participants were more likely to pick White men in expansive vs constrictive poses. However, an expansive vs constrictive pose didn’t make Black men any more likely to be chosen as partners. A follow-up study replicated this finding and also suggested that perceptions of aggression could be responsible: for Black, but not White, targets, expansive poses were associated with more aggression.</p>



<p>While there were a few inconsistencies in some findings on individual ratings across the studies, the work suggests that White men benefit more from expansive poses than Black people do. Whether or not this is also the case for White and Black women is yet to be explored.</p>



<p>But, as the team notes, there could be all kinds of ramifications. For example, adopting an expansive pose in a job interview in an attempt to convey confidence and competence could be less effective for a Black than for a White man. And for a Black but not White man, adopting an expansive pose in a criminal trial in an attempt to project self-assured innocence might be interpreted by non-Black jury members as aggression, and affect judgements of guilt. If expansive poses are linked with aggression for Black men, this might even influence a police officer’s decision to shoot, they argue. They also make this point: “When officers instruct people to raise their hands and to spread their arms and legs, these expansive poses may increase racial biases.”</p>



<p>In fact, write Karmali and Kawakami, there are all kinds of potential scenarios (including in demonstrations and protest marches) when expansive poses may have a positive impact for White people but have little effect or even a negative impact for Black people. “Thus, while one aspect of White male privilege is that White men are allowed to act bold, and may even be rewarded for this boldness, Black men do not benefit to the same extent or are even penalised for such nonverbal behaviours,” the pair concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-triassic-mass-extinction-volcano-survival">Feathers may have helped dinosaurs survive the Triassic mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Widespread volcanic eruptions around 202 million years ago had a profound effect on Earth’s climate, triggering a mass extinction event that killed off three-fourths of the planet’s species, including many large reptiles. Yet dinosaurs, somehow, survived and went on to thrive.</p>



<p>Dinosaurs are often thought of as heat-loving, well suited to the steamy greenhouse environment of the Triassic Period. But the secret to their survival may have been how well adapted they were to the cold, unlike other reptiles of the time. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abo6342">dinosaurs’ warm coats of feathers</a> could have helped the creatures weather relatively brief but intense bouts of volcanic winter associated with the massive eruptions, researchers report July 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>&#8220;We’ve known for a while that there were probably volcanic winters” associated with the massive eruptions, says paleontologist Paul Olsen of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Along with carbon dioxide, volcanoes spew sulfur particles into the atmosphere that can darken skies for years and lower global temperatures — as the Philippines’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geoengineering-tactic-cool-planet-could-hurt-crops">Mount Pinatubo did after its powerful 1991</a> eruption (<em>SN: 8/8/18</em>). “But how [such winters] fit into the picture of the end-Triassic mass extinction has been very unclear.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Olsen and his colleagues present the first physical evidence that not only did such winters occur at the end of the Triassic, but also that dinosaurs were there to weather them. At a site called the Junggar Basin, which at the close of the Triassic was found high in the Arctic Circle, the team identified rock fragments that could only have been deposited by ancient ice alongside the footprints of dinosaurs.</p>



<p>“There is a stereotype that dinosaurs always lived in lush tropical jungles,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. “But this new research shows convincingly that the higher latitudes would have been freezing and even covered in ice during parts of the year” at the beginning of the rise of the dinosaurs, he says.</p>



<p>The Triassic Period ended with a bang beginning around 202 million years ago, as the supercontinent Pangea began to break apart. Massive volcanic eruptions burst forth as the crust split, opening up a basin that became the Atlantic Ocean. The hardened lava from those eruptions now spans 7 million square kilometers across Africa, Europe and North and South America, forming a rock sequence collectively known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, or CAMP.</p>



<p>Carbon dioxide levels were extremely high during the late Triassic and early Jurassic, much of it now thought to have been pumped into the atmosphere by those eruptions. Earth has been assumed to have been in a steamy greenhouse state as a result. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that there’s no evidence of any polar ice sheets at the time; instead, thick forests extended all the way to the poles.</p>



<p>The Junggar Basin, in what’s now northwestern China, was one such region, covered with forests of conifers and deciduous trees growing alongside a massive ancient lake. Dinosaurs certainly lived there: No bones have yet been discovered at the site, but many footprints of the creatures are preserved in the shallow-water siltstones and sandstones that formed at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>About 202 million years ago, most of the world’s landmasses were stitched together into the supercontinent Pangea (illustrated). Dinosaur fossils, including footprints, have been found at sites (dots) across the supercontinent. At the Junggar Basin (red oval) in what’s now northwestern China, scientists discovered evidence of frigid winters at the end of the Triassic Period alongside dinosaur tracks.</p>

</div>



<p>The new data suggest that — despite the extremely high CO<sub>2 </sub>levels — this region also experienced harsh, frigid winters, with the lake at least partially freezing over. The evidence comes from the same rocks that bear the footprints. Analyzing the distribution of grain sizes in the rocks, the researchers determined that a large portion of the grains weren’t part of the original lake mud, but had been carried there from elsewhere.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation, Olsen says, is that these grains are “ice-rafted debris” — a well-known phenomenon in which bits of rock freeze to the base of ice along a shoreline, and then hitch a ride with the ice as it eventually drifts into open water. As the floating ice melts, the bits of rock sink, deposited in new territory.</p>



<p>Volcanic winters might last for tens or even hundreds of years, Olsen says, depending on how long volcanoes continue to erupt. In this case, the huge sheets of lava linked to the CAMP eruptions point to at least tens of thousands of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1705378114">years of eruption pulses</a>, maybe even a million years. That could have kept the winters going for a good long time — long enough to drive many less-well-insulated reptiles off the face of the Earth, he adds. Episodes of those freezing conditions may have even extended all the way to the tropics, the team says.</p>



<p>Evidence of feathers has been found in the fossils of many types of dinosaurs, from carnivorous theropods to herbivorous ornithischians. Recent reports that flying reptiles called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-brightly-colored-feathers-heads-fossil-skull-soft-tissue">pterosaurs had feathers</a> too now suggests that the insulating fuzz has been around for even longer than once thought — possibly appearing as early as 250 million years ago, in a common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>).</p>



<p>Thanks to those insulating feathers, dinosaurs were able to survive the lengthy winters that ensued during the end-Triassic mass extinction, Olsen and colleagues say. Dinosaurs might then have been able to spread rapidly during the Jurassic, occupying niches left vacant by less hardy reptiles.</p>



<p>This study “shows the complexity of disentangling not only the success of certain groups, but also the causes and effects of mass extinction events,” says paleontologist Randall Irmis of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not connected with the study. “There’s a pretty good consensus that [the CAMP eruptions are] the cause of the mass extinction — but there are a lot of subtleties we haven’t appreciated.”</p>



<p>That dinosaurs living in the far north at the time were able to survive due to their feathery insulation makes sense, Irmis says. But whether a volcanic winter caused by dimming could have extended far enough south to freeze the tropics too — giving dinosaurs a similar advantage there — isn’t yet clear. “Dimming is a global effect, but how that plays out is a lot more severe at the poles compared to low latitudes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feathers are probably just one of many reasons why dinosaurs diversified and spread rapidly across the globe at the start of the Jurassic, Irmis says. “There’s a lot that plays into why they became such a successful group.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-mineral-kingdom-classification-crystal-search-life">A new look at the ‘mineral kingdom’ may transform how we search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>If every mineral tells a story, then geologists now have their equivalent of <em>The Arabian Nights</em>.</p>



<p>For the first time, scientists have cataloged every different way that every known mineral can form and put all of that information in one place. This collection of mineral origin stories hints that Earth could have harbored life earlier than previously thought, quantifies the importance of water as the most transformative ingredient in geology, and may change how researchers look for signs of life and water on other planets.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“This is just going to be an explosion,” says Robert Hazen, a mineralogist and astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “You can ask a thousand questions now that we couldn’t have answered before.”</p>



<p>For over 100 years, scientists have defined minerals in terms of “what,” focusing on their structure and chemical makeup. But that can make for an incomplete picture. For example, though all diamonds are a kind of crystalline carbon, three different diamonds might tell three different stories, Hazen says. One could have formed 5 billion years ago in a distant star, another may have been born in a meteorite impact, and a third could have been baked deep below the Earth’s crust.</p>

<p>So Hazen and his colleagues set out to define a different approach to mineral classification. This new angle focuses on the “how” by thinking about minerals as things that evolve out of the history of life, Earth and the solar system, he and his team report July 1 in a pair of studies in <em>American Mineralogist. </em>The researchers <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8099">defined 57 main ways</a> that the “mineral kingdom” forms, with options ranging from condensation out of the space between stars to formation in the excrement of bats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The information in the catalog isn’t new, but it was previously scattered throughout thousands of scientific papers. The “audacity” of their work, Hazen says, was to go through and compile it all together for the more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8105">5,600 known types of minerals</a>. That makes the catalog a one-stop shop for those who want to use minerals to understand the past.</p>



<p>The compilation also allowed the team to take a step back and think about mineral evolution from a broader perspective. Patterns immediately popped out. One of the new studies shows that over half of all known mineral kinds form in ways that ought to have been possible on the newborn Earth. The implication: Of all the geologic environments that scientists have considered as potential <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">crucibles for the beginning of life on Earth</a>, most could have existed as early as 4.3 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/24/20)</em>. Life, therefore, may have formed almost as soon as Earth did, or at the very least, had more time to arise than scientists have thought. Rocks with traces of life <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">date to only 3.4 billion years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That would be a very, very profound implication — that the potential for life is baked in at the very beginning of a planet,” says Zachary Adam, a paleobiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved in the new studies.</p>



<p>The exact timing of when conditions ripe for life arose is based on “iffy” models, though, says Frances Westall, a geobiologist at the Center for Molecular Biophysics in Orléans, France, who was also not part of Hazen’s team. She thinks that scientists need more data before they can be sure. But, she says, “the principle is fantastic.”</p>



<p>The new results also show how essential water has been to making most of the minerals on Earth. Roughly 80 percent of known mineral types need H<sub>2</sub>O to form, the team reports.</p>



<p>“Water is just incredibly important,” Hazen says, adding that the estimate is conservative. “It may be closer to 90 percent.”</p>

<p>Taken one way, this means that if researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-lost-missing-crust-space-simulation">see water</a> on a planet like Mars, they can guess that it has a rich mineral ecosystem (<em>SN: 3/16/21)</em>. But flipping this idea may be more useful: Scientists could identify what minerals are on the Red Planet and then use the new catalog to work backward and figure out what its environment was like in the past. A group of minerals, for example, might be explainable only if there had been water, or even life.</p>



<p>Right now, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">do this sort of detective work</a> on just a few minerals at a time (<em>SN: 5/11/20)</em>. But if researchers want to make the most of the samples collected on other planets, something more comprehensive is needed, Adam says, like the new study’s framework.</p>



<p>And that’s just the beginning. “The value of this [catalog] is that it’s ongoing and potentially multigenerational,” Adam says. “We can go back to it again and again and again for different kinds of questions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we have a lot more we can do,” agrees Shaunna Morrison, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution and coauthor of the new studies. “We’re just scratching the surface.”</p>

<p>In the beginning, scientists believe there was an interstellar gas cloud of all the elements comprising the Earth. A billion or so years later, the Earth was a globe of concentric spheres with a solid iron inner core, a liquid iron outer core and a liquid silicate mantle…. The current theory is that the primeval cloud’s materials accreted … and that sometime after accretion, the iron, melted by radioactive heating, sank toward the center of the globe…. Now another concept is gaining ground: that the Earth may have accreted … with core formation and accretion occurring simultaneously.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Most scientists now agree that the core formed as materials that make up Earth collided and glommed together and that the process was driven by heat from the smashups. The planet’s heart is primarily made of iron, nickel and some oxygen, but what other elements may dwell there and in what forms remains an open question. Recently, scientists proposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">the inner core could be superionic</a>, with liquid hydrogen flowing through an iron and silicon lattice (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>When we’re asked to imagine a scene or object, most of us are able to conjure up an image in our mind’s eye. But about 2-5% of the population can’t do this: they have a condition called <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/03/bonus-episode-whats-it-like-to-have-no-minds-eye/">aphantasia</a>, and are unable to produce mental imagery at all.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001809#">a study</a> published in <em>Cognition</em> has found that aphantasia can affect memory abilities too. The researchers report that aphantasics have less detailed and rich memories for events in their lives: a finding that not only reveals more about the condition, but also highlights the key role of mental imagery in memory generally.</p>



<span id="more-47921"></span>



<p>Past work had shown that people with aphantasia report almost no mental imagery when recalling past events from their lives or when thinking about potential future events. But these findings were based on participants rating their own abilities, note Alexei Dawes and colleagues from the University of New South Wales. So the team decided to examine whether aphantasic participants also show memory deficits in more objective measures.</p>



<p>The researchers recruited 30 participants with aphantasia and 30 control participants who didn’t have any problems with mental imagery.  All participants filled in questionnaires asking them to report the vividness off various kinds of mental imagery, including when recalling scenes from their lives. The researchers found that — as in past studies — the aphantasic participants reported having less vivid mental imagery (although, again consistent with past work, their spatial imagery was just as good as that of control participants).</p>



<p>To get a more “objective” measure of memory deficits, the team then looked at the kind of information people provided when describing their memories. Participants were asked to remember six events in their lives, as well as think about six hypothetical future events, and write a description of each. For their analysis, the researchers looked at different categories of details contained in these descriptions (for instance, details relating to participants’ sensations, thoughts, or emotions). After writing each description, participants also reported their own subjective experiences of that particular event, such as how vivid it was and how much emotion they felt.</p>



<p>The team found that aphantasic participants gave fewer details than control participants about both kinds of event. This effect seemed to be driven specifically by the fact that they wrote down fewer visual details; the groups didn’t differ in the amount of detail they gave that involved other senses like smell or hearing, or that concerned other aspects of the event like thoughts or emotions they experienced.</p>



<p>The two groups also differed in how they reported experiencing the memories and imagining the future events. Compared to controls, aphantasics indicated that the events were less vivid and contained fewer sensory or spatial details, for instance, and they also reported experiencing less emotion when thinking about the event.</p>



<p>Overall, the results show that people with aphantasia have less vivid and detailed memories — particularly when it comes to visual details — and this this effect is clear whether they are asked about their experience or tested in more &#8220;objective&#8221; ways. The authors write that their findings represent the “first robust behavioural evidence that visual imagery absence is associated with a significantly reduced capacity to simulate the past and construct the future”.</p>



<p>The very fact that aphantasics show these deficits also implies that mental imagery is generally an important part of recalling events or imagining future ones. This probably isn’t a huge surprise — but as the authors point out, is something that has been hard to test empirically until now. However, the study also shows that mental imagery isn’t everything: people with aphantasia were still able to retrieve memories, after all. Instead, it seems that mental imagery is specifically involved in that aspect of memory that involves “re-living” events in our minds.</p>

                <p>This month, a <em>PLOS Medicine</em> study has found that children exposed to road traffic noise at school exhibit signs of relatively slower attention spans and working memory development compared to those educated in a quieter environment. The study done in Europe could spark the creation of environmental noise policies to protect school environments. Learn more about the study design in our monthly Research Highlights summary below or check out the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Road traffic noise is the most widespread environmental and transportation noise source in Europe and the second most detrimental environmental factor for ill health in Europe after air pollution. An increasing number of epidemiological studies in adults detail the health impacts of transportation noise, but little is known about the effects in children.</p>



<p><strong>Study design and findings</strong></p>

<p>Maria Foraster and colleagues at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) studied a sample of 2,680 children aged 7-10 years at 38 schools in Barcelona, Spain between January 2012 and March 2013. The children completed computerized cognitive tests four times during one year to assess the development of working memory, complex working memory, and inattentiveness. The researchers measured markers of annual exposure to intensity levels and fluctuation in road traffic noise both inside and outside the schools at the beginning of the year and estimated exposure to intensity levels outdoors at home using Barcelona&rsquo;s road traffic noise map for 2012. Their analyses also controlled for levels of traffic-related air pollution and sociodemographics, among other factors.</p>



<p>In the children, exposure to higher intensity and fluctuation in road traffic noise measured outside the school was associated with a slower development of working memory, complex working memory, and attention over 12 months. Inside the classroom, associations with all cognitive development measures were more evident for exposure to noise fluctuation than for intensity levels. No associations were found for exposure to road traffic noise at home.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The team did not measure past noise exposure in their population which could affect the test scores. However, the authors reported that 98% of the children had attended the same school at least for one year and that noise levels are generally steady over time. The findings are of public health relevance given the number of children around the world who are exposed to road traffic noise in schools, but similar testing should be done elsewhere before the findings are generalized to other populations.</p>



<p>Foraster adds, &ldquo;Children exposed to road traffic noise at school and in the classroom showed slower cognitive development in terms of working memory and attention compared to children attending quieter schools.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nerve-cooler-pain-relief-electronic-implant">This soft, electronic ‘nerve cooler’ could be a new way to relieve pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>A flexible electronic implant could one day make pain management a lot more chill.</p>



<p>Created from materials that dissolve in the body, the device encircles nerves with an evaporative cooler. Implanted in rats, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8532">the cooler blocked pain signals</a> from zipping up to the brain, bioengineer John Rogers and colleagues report in the July 1 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Though far from ready for human use, a future version could potentially let “patients dial up or down the pain relief they need at any given moment,” says Rogers, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists already knew that low temperatures can numb nerves in the body. Think of frozen fingers in the winter, Rogers says. But mimicking this phenomenon with an electronic implant isn’t easy. Nerves are fragile, so scientists need something that gently hugs the tissues. And an ideal implant would be absorbed by the body, so doctors wouldn’t have to remove it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Made from water-soluble materials, the team’s device features a soft cuff that wraps around a nerve like toilet paper on a roll. Tiny channels snake down its rubbery length. When liquid coolant that’s pumped through the channels evaporates, the process draws heat from the underlying nerve. A temperature sensor helps scientists hit the sweet spot — cold enough to block pain but not too cold to damage the nerve.</p>



<p>The researchers wrapped the implant around a nerve in rats and tested how they responded to having a paw poked. With the nerve cooler switched on, scientists could apply about seven times as much pressure as usual before the animals pulled their paws away. That’s a sign that the rats’ senses had grown sluggish, Rogers says.</p>



<p>He envisions the device being used to treat pain after surgery, rather than chronic pain. The cooler connects to an outside power source and would be tethered to patients like an IV line. They could control the level of pain relief by adjusting the coolant’s flow rate. Such a system might offer targeted relief without the downsides of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-oklahoma-opioid-trial-highlights-deadly-drugs-epidemic">addictive pain medications like opioids</a><em>,</em> Rogers suggests <em>(SN: 8/27/19)</em>.</p>



<p>Now the researchers want to explore how long they can apply the cooling effect without damaging tissues, Rogers says. In experiments, the longest that they cooled rats’ nerves was for about 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If treating pain, cooling would have to go on for a much longer period of time,” says Seward Rutkove, a nerve physiologist at Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. Still, he adds, the device is “an interesting proof of concept and should definitely be pursued.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bone-loss-density-astronaut-recovery-gravity">Six months in space leads to a decade’s worth of long-term bone loss</a></h4>

              
                <p>You might want to bring your dumbbells on that next spaceflight.</p>



<p>During space missions lasting six months or longer, astronauts can experience bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging. A year of recovery in Earth’s gravity <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13461-1">rebuilds about half of that lost bone strength</a>, researchers report June 30 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Bones “are a living organ,” says Leigh Gabel, an exercise scientist at the University of Calgary in Canada. “They’re alive and active, and they&#8217;re constantly remodeling.” But without gravity, bones lose strength.</p>





<p>Gabel and her colleagues tracked 17 astronauts, 14 men and three women with the average age of 47, who spent from four to seven months in space. The team used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, or HR-pQCT, which can measure 3-D bone microarchitecture on scales of 61 microns, finer than the thickness of human hair, to image the bone structure of the tibia in the lower leg and the radius in the lower arm. The team took these images at four points in time — before spaceflight, when the astronauts returned from space, and then six months and one year later — and used them to calculate bone strength and density.</p>



<p>Astronauts in space for less than six months were able to regain their preflight bone strength after a year back in Earth’s gravity. But those in space longer had permanent bone loss in their shinbones, or tibias, equivalent to a decade of aging. Their lower-arm bones, or radii, showed almost no loss, likely because these aren’t weight-bearing bones, says Gabel.</p>



<p>Increasing weight lifting exercises in space could help alleviate bone loss, says Steven Boyd, also a Calgary exercise scientist. “A whole bunch of struts and beams all held together give your bone its overall strength,” says Boyd. “Those struts or beams are what we lose in spaceflight.” Once these microscopic tissues called trabeculae are gone, you can’t rebuild them, but you can strengthen the remaining ones, he says. The researchers found the remaining bone thickened upon return to Earth’s gravity.</p>

<p>“With longer spaceflight, we can expect bigger bone loss and probably a bigger problem with recovery,” says physiologist Laurence Vico of the University of Saint-Étienne in France, who was not part of the study. That’s especially concerning given that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">a crewed future mission to, say, Mars</a> would last at least two years (<em>SN: 7/15/20</em>). She adds that space agencies should also consider other bone health measures, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-for-thought/zero-gravity-diet">such as nutrition</a>, to reduce bone absorption and increase bone formation (<em>SN: 3/8/05</em>). “It&#8217;s probably a cocktail of countermeasure that we will have to find,” Vico says.</p>



<p>Gabel, Boyd and their colleagues hope to gain insight on how spending more than seven months in space affects bones. They are part of a planned NASA project to study the effects of a year in space on more than a dozen body systems. “We really hope that people hit a plateau, that they stop losing bone after a while,” says Boyd.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Few things are as stressful as listening to your baby crying — and excessive crying is clearly not good for the baby, either. <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/kangaroo-mother-care-may-boost-the-survival-of-newborn-premature-babies/">Skin-to-skin contact is widely used in the first hours after a birth</a>, with benefits for infants and parents. But, according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-66006-001">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>, a daily hour of skin-to-skin contact for weeks afterwards is beneficial, too: it reduces crying and improves sleep.</p>



<span id="more-47916"></span>



<p>Kelly Cooijmans at Radboud University, in the Netherlands, and her colleagues recruited Dutch healthy first-time mothers with full-term infants for their randomized controlled trial. On signing up while pregnant, the women knew they were taking part in a trial aimed at improving infant crying and sleep, but not what the intervention would be.</p>



<p>Prolonged mother-infant skin-to-skin contact is not part of Dutch culture, the team notes. So when one group was instructed to perform &#8220;care as usual&#8221;, extended skin-to-skin contact took place only immediately after birth. The other group was asked to ensure that their baby had an hour a day of this contact for five weeks. The mothers were also asked to report on a range of measures, including how long their infant cried and slept, for the first 12 weeks of their baby’s life. (As women in the Netherlands get 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, the team felt that this would all be practically feasible.)</p>



<p>Only relatively few women — 16 of an initial 64 in the daily contact group — did actually fully follow the protocol. Their babies cried less overall and had shorter individual crying bouts. In their first few days of life, they slept for longer, too. The data also suggested a dose-response relationship between skin contact and crying: more minutes of contact was associated with less crying and also, in the first days at least, more sleep. “Our findings suggest that extended [skin to skin contact] adds to the already beneficial effects during the first postnatal hours/days, at least regarding infant crying and sleeping,” the team writes.</p>



<p>There are various potential mechanisms. Warm, soft, human touch signals that a caregiver is there, close at hand. It is known to be calming. Skin-to-skin contact also specifically triggers the release of oxytocin in both the mother and infant, the team adds — and this has known stress-reducing effects. Advantages of the intervention are, the team writes, that it is “uncomplicated and low cost”.</p>



<p>However, while it might carry no immediate financial cost for women on paid maternity leave, the high drop-out rate certainly suggests that the mothers did perceive it to have other kinds of costs. In fact, 10% reported having trouble fitting it into their daily routine and 14% said that their own mental or physical recovery problems made it difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s true that when these women were recruited, there was no evidence that time invested in regular daily skin-to-skin contact could have a pay-off in terms of reduced crying, the team notes. Perhaps the new, preliminary data might encourage some new mothers to try the protocol. And there were some significant benefits. In week 2, for example, the team reports a daily crying duration of 106 minutes for those mothers who fully followed the protocol vs 129 for the control. That’s an average of 23 fewer minutes spent crying per day.</p>



<p>Still, it’s worth noting that the mothers in the intervention group paid for this with an hour a day of their time. Keeping a baby close in a sling can be tricky enough; ensuring you’re in a suitable place each day for an hour of bare skin-to-skin contact is clearly even more demanding. Whatever a mother’s circumstances, let’s not pretend that there are no or &#8220;low&#8221; costs attached to the potential benefits, because that places very little value on her invested time. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-booster-omicron-variant-coronavirus">New COVID-19 boosters could contain bits of the omicron variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>For all the coronavirus variants that have thrown pandemic curve balls — including alpha, beta, gamma and delta — COVID-19 vaccines have stayed the same. That could change this fall.<br><br>On June 28, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration met to discuss whether vaccine developers should update their jabs to include a portion of the omicron variant — the version of the coronavirus that currently dominates the globe. The verdict: The omicron variant is different enough that it’s time to change the vaccines. Those shots <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-recommends-inclusion-omicron-ba45-component-covid-19-vaccine-booster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be a dual mix</a> that includes both a piece of the nearly identical omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5 and the virus from the original vaccines, the FDA announced June 30. </p>



<p>“This doesn’t mean that we are saying that there will be boosters recommended for everyone in the fall,” Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer for vaccine policy at the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at the meeting. “But my belief is that this gives us the right vaccine for preparation for boosters in the fall.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>The decision to update COVID-19 vaccines didn’t come out of nowhere. In the two-plus years that the coronavirus has been spreading around the world, it has had a few “updates” of its own — mutating some of its proteins that allow the virus to more effectively infect our cells or hide from our immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccine developers had previously crafted vaccines to tackle the beta variant that was first identified in South Africa in late 2020. Those were scrapped after studies showed that current vaccines remained effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current vaccines gave our immune systems the tools to recognize variants such as beta and alpha, which each had a handful of changes from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that sparked the pandemic. But the omicron variant is a slipperier foe. Lots more viral mutations combined with our own waning immunity mean that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">once omicron can gain a foothold</a> in the body, vaccine protection isn’t as good as it once was at fending off COVID-19 symptoms (<em>SN: 6/27/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shots still largely protect people from developing severe symptoms, but there has been an uptick in hospitalizations, especially among older people, Heather Scobie, deputy team lead of the CDC’s Surveillance and Analytics Epidemiology Task Force said at the meeting. Deaths among older age groups are also beginning to increase. And while it&#8217;s impossible to predict the future, we could be in for another tough fall and winter, epidemiologist Justin Lessler of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said at the meeting. From March 2022 to March 2023, simulations project that deaths from COVID-19 in the United States might number in the tens to hundreds of thousands.</p>



<p>A switch to omicron-containing jabs may give people an extra layer of protection for the upcoming winter. Pfizer-BioNTech presented data at the meeting showing that updated versions of its mRNA shot<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-omicron-adapted-covid-19"> gave clinical trial participants a boost of antibodies that recognize omicron</a>. One version included omicron alone, while the other is a twofer, or bivalent, jab that mixes the original formulation with omicron. <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Announces-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Superior-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron/default.aspx">Moderna’s</a> bivalent shot boosted antibodies too. Novavax, which developed a protein-based vaccine that the FDA is still mulling whether to authorize for emergency use, doesn’t have an omicron-based vaccine yet, though the company said its original shot gives people broad protection, generating antibodies that probably will recognize omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfizer and Moderna both updated their vaccines using a version of omicron called BA.1, which was the dominant variant in the United States in December and January. But BA.1 has siblings and has already been outcompeted by some of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since omicron first appeared late last year, “we’ve seen a relatively troubling, rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said at the advisory meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, omicron subvariants BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant versions in the United States and other countries. The CDC estimates that roughly half of new U.S. infections the week ending June 25 were caused by either BA.4 or BA.5. By the time the fall rolls around, yet another new version of omicron — or a different variant entirely — may join their ranks. The big question is which of these subvariants to include in the vaccines to give people the best protection possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BA.1, the version already in the updated vaccines, may be the right choice, virologist Kanta Subbarao said at the FDA advisory meeting. An advisory committee to the World Health Organization, which Subbarao chairs, <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/17-06-2022-interim-statement-on--the-composition-of-current-COVID-19-vaccines">recommended on June 17 that vaccines may need to be tweaked to include omicron</a>, likely BA.1. “We’re not trying to match [what variants] may circulate,” Subbarao said. Instead, the goal is to make sure that the immune system is as prepared as possible to recognize a wide variety of variants, not just specific ones. The hope is that the broader the immune response, the better our bodies will be at fighting the virus off even as it evolves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The variant that is farthest removed from the original virus is probably the best candidate to accomplish that goal, said Subbarao, who is director of the WHO’s Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Computational analyses of how antibodies recognize different versions of the coronavirus suggest that BA.1 is probably the original coronavirus variant’s most distant sibling, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some members of the FDA advisory committee disagreed with choosing BA.1, instead saying that they’d prefer vaccines that include a portion of BA.4 or BA.5. With BA.1 largely gone, it may be better to follow the proverbial hockey puck where it’s going rather than where it’s been, said Bruce Gellin, chief of Global Public Health Strategy with the Rockefeller Foundation in Washington, D.C. Plus, BA.4 and BA.5 are also vastly different from the original variant. Both have identical spike proteins, which the virus uses to break into cells and the vaccines use to teach our bodies to recognize an infection. So when it comes to making vaccines, the two are somewhat interchangeable.</p>

<p>There are some real-world data suggesting that current vaccines offer the least amount of protection from BA.4 and BA.5 compared with other omicron subvariants, Marks said. Pfizer also presented data showing results from a test in mice of a bivalent jab with the original coronavirus strain plus BA.4/BA.5. The shot sparked a broad immune response that boosted antibodies against four omicron subvariants. It’s unclear what that means for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone on the FDA advisory committee agreed that an update now is necessary — two members voted against it. Pediatrician Henry Bernstein of Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in Uniondale, N.Y., noted that the current vaccines are still effective against severe disease and that there aren’t enough data to show that any changes would boost vaccine effectiveness. Pediatric infectious disease specialist Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that he agrees that vaccines should help people broaden their immune responses, but he’s not yet convinced omicron is the right variant for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plenty of other open questions remain too. The FDA could have authorized either a vaccine that contains omicron alone or a bivalent shot. Some data presented at the meeting hinted that a bivalent dose might spark immunity that could be more durable, but that&#8217;s still unknown. Pfizer and Moderna tested their updated shots in adults. It’s unclear what the results mean for kids. Also unknown is whether people who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 could eventually start with such an omicron-based vaccine instead of the original two doses.</p>



<p>Maybe researchers will get some answers before boosters start in the fall. But health agencies needed to make decisions now, so vaccine developers have a chance to make the shots in the first place. Unfortunately, we’re always lagging behind the virus, said pediatrician Hayley Gans of Stanford University. “We can’t always wait for the data to catch up.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-megatooth-sharks-food-chain-apex-predator-ocean">Megatooth sharks may have been higher on the food chain than any ocean animal ever</a></h4>

              
                <p>Whenever paleontologist Dana Ehret gives talks about the 15-meter-long prehistoric sharks known as megalodons, he likes to make a joke: “What did megalodon eat?” asks Ehret, Assistant Curator of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton. “Well,” he says, “whatever it wanted.”</p>



<p>Now, there might be evidence that’s literally true. Some megalodons (O<em>todus megalodon</em>) may have been “hyper apex predators,” <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl6529">higher up the food chain than any ocean animal ever known</a>, researchers report in the June 22 <em>Science Advances</em>. Using chemical measurements of fossilized teeth, scientists compared the diets of marine animals — from polar bears to ancient great white sharks — and found that megalodons and their direct ancestors were often predators on a level never seen before.</p>





<p>The finding contradicts another recent study, which found megalodons were at a similar level in the food chain as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">great white sharks</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/22</em>). If true, the new results might change how researchers think about what drove megalodons to extinction around 3.5 million years ago.</p>



<p>In the latest study, researchers examined dozens of fossilized teeth for varieties of nitrogen, called isotopes, that have different numbers of neutrons. In animals, one specific nitrogen isotope tends to be more common than another. A predator absorbs both when it eats prey, so the imbalance between the isotopes grows further up the food chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, scientists have used this trend to learn about modern creatures’ diets. But researchers were almost never able to apply it to fossils millions of years old because the nitrogen levels were too low. In the new study, scientists get around this by feeding their samples to bacteria that digest the nitrogen into a chemical the team can more easily measure.</p>



<p>The result: Megalodon and its direct ancestors, known collectively as megatooth sharks, showed nitrogen isotope excesses sometimes greater than any known marine animal.&nbsp;They were on average probably two levels higher on the food chain than today’s great white sharks, which is like saying that some megalodons would have eaten a beast that ate great whites.</p>



<p>“I definitely thought that I’d just messed up in the lab,” says Emma Kast, a biogeochemist at the University of Cambridge. Yet on closer inspection, the data held up.</p>



<p>The result is “eyebrow-raising,” says Robert Boessenecker, a paleontologist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina who was not involved in the study. “Even if megalodon was eating nothing but killer whales, it would still need to be getting some of this excess nitrogen from something else,” he says, “and there’s just nothing else in the ocean today that has nitrogen isotopes that are that concentrated.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know how to explain it,” he says.</p>



<p>There are possibilities. Megalodons may have eaten predatory sperm whales, though those went extinct before the megatooth sharks. Or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-megalodon-shark-teeth-cannabilism-womb">megalodons could have been cannibals</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/20)</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another complication comes from the earlier, contradictory study. Those researchers examined the same food chain — &nbsp;in some cases, even the same shark teeth — using a zinc isotope instead of nitrogen. They drew the opposite conclusion, finding megalodons were on a similar level as other apex predators.</p>



<p>The zinc method is not as established as the nitrogen method, though nitrogen isotopes have also rarely been used this way before. “It could be that we don’t have a total understanding and grasp of this technique,” says Sora Kim, a paleoecologist at the University of California, Merced who was involved in both studies. “But if [the newer study] is right, that’s crazy.”</p>



<p>Confirming the results would be a step toward understanding why megalodons died off. If great whites had a similar diet, it could mean that they outcompeted megalodons for food, says Ehret, who was not involved in the study. The new findings suggest that’s unlikely, but leave room for the possibility that great whites competed with — or simply ate — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newborn-megalodon-sharks-fossils-larger-most-adult-humans">juvenile megalodons</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Measuring more shark teeth with both techniques could solve the mystery and reconcile the studies. At the same time, Kast says, there’s plenty to explore with their method for measuring nitrogen isotopes in fossils. “There’s so many animals and so many different ecosystems and time periods,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boessenecker agrees. When it comes to the ancient oceans, he says, “I guarantee we’re going to find out some really weird stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">How physicists are probing the Higgs boson 10 years after its discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Javier Duarte kicked off his scientific career by witnessing the biggest particle physics event in decades. On July 4, 2012, scientists at the laboratory CERN near Geneva announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, the long-sought subatomic particle that reveals the origins of mass. Duarte was an eager graduate student who’d just arrived at CERN.</p>



<p>“I was physically there maybe a week before the announcement,” Duarte says. As buzzing throngs of physicists crowded together to watch the announcement at CERN, Duarte didn’t make it to the main auditorium. That space was for VIPs — and those determined enough to wait in line all night to snag a seat. Instead, he says, he found himself in the basement, in an overflow room of an overflow room.</p>





<p>But the enthusiasm was still palpable. “It was a very exciting time to be getting immersed into that world,” he says. Since then, he and thousands of other physicists from around the world working on CERN experiments have gone all out exploring the particle’s properties.</p>



<p>Scientists predicted the existence of the Higgs boson back in 1964, as a hallmark of the process that gives elementary particles mass. But finding the particle had to wait for CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, or LHC. In 2010, the LHC began smashing protons together at extremely high energies, while two large experiments, <a href="https://atlas.cern">ATLAS</a> and <a href="https://cms.cern">CMS</a>, used massive detectors to look through the debris.</p>





<p>The particle’s discovery <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">filled in the missing keystone of the standard model</a> of particle physics. That theory explains the known elementary particles and their interactions. Those particles and interactions are behind just about everything we know. The particles serve as building blocks of atoms and transmit crucial forces of nature, such as electromagnetism. And the mass of those particles is key to their behavior. If electrons were massless, for example, atoms wouldn’t form. Without the Higgs boson, then, one of scientists’ most successful theories would collapse.</p>



<p>The Higgs boson discovery dominated headlines around the globe. About half a million people tuned in to watch the livestreamed announcement, and footage from the event appeared on more than 5,000 news programs. Even oddball minutiae made it into the press, with a few articles analyzing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-comic-sans-twitter">the physicists’ use of the often-scorned font Comic Sans</a> in their presentation. Little more than a year later, the discovery <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/higgs-boson-wins-scientists-nobel-prize-physics">garnered a Nobel Prize</a> for two of the scientists who developed the theory behind the Higgs boson, François Englert and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elusive-book-peter-higgs-boson-mass-physics">Peter Higgs</a> — for whom the particle is named.</p>

<p>Now, as the discovery turns 10 years old, that initial excitement persists for Duarte and many other particle physicists. As a professor at the University of California, San Diego and member of the CMS experiment, Duarte’s research still revolves around the all-important particle. Progress in understanding the Higgs has been “stunning,” he says. “We’ve come so much farther than we expected to.”</p>



<p>Physicists have been working through a checklist of things they want to know about the Higgs boson. They spent the last decade cataloging its properties, including how it interacts with several other particles. Though measurements have so far been in line with the predictions made by the standard model, if a discrepancy turns up in the future, it may mean there are unknown particles yet to be discovered.</p>



<p>And there’s still more on the agenda. An especially important item is the Higgs boson’s interaction with itself. To help pin down this and other Higgs properties, scientists are looking forward to collecting more data. Scientists turned on an upgraded LHC for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">a new round of work</a> in April. At the time of the Higgs discovery, collisions at the LHC reached an energy of 8 trillion electron volts. Collisions are expected to roll in at a record 13.6 trillion electron volts <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/cern/dont-miss-live-stream-launch-run-3">starting July 5</a>, and data-taking will continue until 2026. These higher energies offer opportunities to spot heavier particles. And the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/large-hadron-collider-getting-upgrade">High-Luminosity LHC</a>, a more powerful iteration of the LHC, is expected to start up in 2029.</p>



<p>“Finding a particle, it sounds like the end of something, but it’s really only the beginning,” says experimental particle physicist María Cepeda of CIEMAT in Madrid, a member of the CMS collaboration.</p>

<h3>The standard model</h3>



<p>The standard model of particle physics explains the known elementary particles and their interactions. It consists of 17 particles, many of which have antiparticle partners. The fermions, or matter particles, include six types of quarks (blue) and six leptons (pink). The bosons, or force-carrying particles (orange), transmit the fundamental forces. The Higgs boson has special status: It explains the origin of particles’ masses.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Coupling up</h4>



<p>Studying the Higgs boson is like geocaching, says theoretical particle physicist Gudrun Heinrich of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Much like hobbyists use a GPS device to uncover a hidden stash of fun trinkets, physicists are using their wits to uncover the treasure trove of the Higgs boson. In 2012, scientists merely located the cache; the next 10 years were devoted to revealing its contents. And that investigation continues. “The hope is that the contents will contain something like a map that is guiding us towards an even bigger treasure,” Heinrich says.</p>



<p>Detailed study of the Higgs boson could help scientists solve mysteries that the standard model fails to explain. “We know that the theory has limitations,” says theoretical particle physicist Laura Reina of Florida State University in Tallahassee. For instance, the standard model has no explanation for dark matter, a shadowy substance that throws its weight around the cosmos, exerting a gravitational pull necessary to explain a variety of astronomical observations. And the theory can’t explain other quandaries, like why the universe is composed mostly of matter rather than its alter ego, antimatter. Many proposed solutions to the standard model’s shortcomings require new particles that would alter how the Higgs interacts with known particles.</p>



<p>The Higgs boson itself isn’t responsible for mass. Instead, that’s the job of the Higgs field. According to quantum physics, all particles are actually blips in invisible fields, like ripples atop a pond. Higgs bosons are swells in the Higgs field, which pervades the entire cosmos. When elementary particles interact with the Higgs field, they gain mass. The more massive the particle, the more strongly it interacts with the Higgs field, and with the Higgs boson. Massless particles, like photons, don’t directly interact with the Higgs field at all.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-data-give-clearer-picture-higgs-boson">hunt for Higgs-related treasure</a> is to measure those interactions, known as “couplings.” The Higgs couplings describe what particles the Higgs boson decays into, what particles can fuse to produce Higgs bosons and how often those processes occur. Scientists gauge these couplings by sifting through and analyzing the showers of particles produced when Higgs bosons pop up in the debris of proton smashups.</p>



<p>Even if unknown particles are too heavy to show up at the LHC, the Higgs couplings could reveal their existence. “Any of these couplings not being what you expect them to be is a very clear sign of incredibly interesting new physics behind it,” says particle physicist Marumi Kado of Sapienza University of Rome and CERN, who is the deputy spokesperson for the ATLAS collaboration.</p>

<p>Physicists have already checked the couplings to several elementary particles. These include both major classes of particles in physics: bosons (particles that carry forces) and fermions (particles that make up matter, such as electrons). Scientists have measured the Higgs’ interactions with a heavy relative of the electron called a tau lepton (a fermion) and with the W and Z bosons, particles that transmit the weak force, which is responsible for some types of radioactive decay. Researchers also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-decay-bottom-quarks-lhc">pegged the Higgs’ couplings</a> to the top quark and bottom quark. Those are two of the six types of quarks, which glom together into larger particles such as protons and neutrons. (The Higgs is responsible for the mass of elementary particles, but the mass of composite particles, including protons and neutrons, instead comes mostly from the energy of the particles jangling around within.)</p>



<p>The couplings measured so far involve the standard model’s heavier elementary particles. The top quark, for example, is about as heavy as an entire gold atom. Since the Higgs couples more strongly to heavy particles, those interactions tend to be easier to measure. Next up, scientists want to observe the lighter particles’ couplings. ATLAS and CMS have used their giant detectors to see hints of the Higgs decaying to muons, the middleweight sibling in the electron family, lighter than the tau but heavier than the electron. The teams have also begun checking the coupling to charm quarks, which are less massive than top and bottom quarks.</p>



<p>So far, the Higgs has conformed to the standard model. “The big thing we discovered is it looks pretty much like we expected it to. There have been no big surprises,” says theoretical particle physicist Sally Dawson of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y.</p>



<p>But there might be discrepancies that just haven’t been detected yet. The standard model predictions agree with measured couplings within error bars of around 10 percent or more. But no one knows if they agree to within 5 percent, or 1 percent. The more precisely scientists can measure these couplings, the better they can test for any funny business.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>An interaction checklist&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Studying how the Higgs boson interacts with other particles is one way to test whether it fits with predictions of the standard model. Scientists have measured the Higgs’ interactions, or “couplings,” with five standard model particles (dark pink in the graphic), and have early evidence of coupling with a sixth. Heavier particles have been the first targets since they interact more strongly with the Higgs boson (as seen in the graph), so are easier to measure. So far, all measured couplings agree with predictions.</p>

<h4>One of a kind</h4>



<p>Before the LHC turned on, scientists had a clear favorite for a physics theory that could solve some of the standard model’s woes: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supersymmetrys-absence-lhc-puzzles-physicists">supersymmetry</a>, a class of theories in which every known particle has an undiscovered partner particle. Physicists had hoped such particles would turn up at the LHC. But none have been found yet. Though supersymmetry isn’t fully ruled out, the possibilities for the theory are far more limited.</p>



<p>With no consensus candidate among many other theories for what could be beyond the standard model, a lot of focus rests on the Higgs. Physicists hope studies of the Higgs will reveal something that might point in the right direction to untangle some of the standard model’s snarls. “Measuring [the Higgs boson’s] properties is going to tell us much more about what is beyond the standard model … than anything before,” Reina says.</p>



<p>One question that scientists are investigating in LHC smashups is whether the Higgs is truly unique. All the other known elementary particles have a quantum form of angular momentum, known as spin. But the Higgs has a spin of zero, what’s known as a “scalar.” Other types of particles tend to come in families, so it’s not outlandish to imagine that the Higgs boson could have scalar relatives. “It could be there’s a huge scalar sector somewhere hiding and we just saw the first particle of it,” Heinrich says. Supersymmetry predicts multiple Higgs bosons, but there are plenty of other ideas that envision Higgs accomplices.</p>



<p>It’s also possible that the Higgs is not actually elementary. Combinations of particles, such as quarks, are known to make up larger particles with spins of zero. Perhaps the Higgs, like those other scalars, is made up of yet unknown smaller stuff.</p>



<p>While hunting for these answers, physicists will be watching closely for any connection between the Higgs’ behavior and other recent puzzling results. In 2021, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">Muon g−2 experiment at Fermilab</a> in Batavia, Ill., reported hints that muons have magnetic properties that don’t agree with predictions of the standard model. And in April, scientists with the CDF experiment — which studied particle collisions at Fermilab until 2011 — found that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">W boson’s mass is heavier than the standard model predicts</a>.</p>



<p>The Higgs boson’s relative newness makes it ripe for discoveries that could help sort out these quandaries. “The Higgs boson is the least explored elementary particle, and it could be a door to the other mysteries we still have to uncover or to shed light on,” Heinrich says.</p>

<h4>Self-talk</h4>



<p>To work out thorny puzzles, physicists sometimes talk to themselves. Fittingly, another puzzle atop scientists’ Higgs to-do list is whether the particle, likewise, talks to itself.</p>



<p>This “self-coupling,” how Higgs bosons interact with one another, has never been measured before. But “it turns out to be really just an incredible barometer of new physics,” says theoretical particle physicist Nathaniel Craig of the University of California, Santa Barbara. For example, measuring the Higgs self-coupling could suss out hidden particles that interact only with the Higgs, oblivious to any of the other standard model particles.</p>



<p>The Higgs self-coupling is closely related to the Higgs potential, an undulating, sombrero-shaped surface that describes the energy of the universe-pervading Higgs field. In the early universe, that potential determined how the fundamental particles gained mass, when the Higgs field first turned on.</p>



<p>How, exactly, that transition from massless to massive happened has some big implications for the cosmos. It could help explain how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/higgs-boson-effects-universe-boosted">matter gained the upper hand over antimatter</a> in the early universe. If the Higgs field did play that role in the universe’s beginnings, Craig says, “it’s going to leave some fingerprints on the Higgs potential that we measure today.”</p>



<p>Depending on the full shape of the Higgs potential’s sombrero, at some point in the exceedingly distant future, the Higgs field could shift again, as it did in the early universe. Such a jump would change the masses of fundamental particles, creating a universe in which familiar features, including life, are probably obliterated.</p>



<p>To better understand the Higgs potential, scientists will attempt to measure the self-coupling. They’ll do it by looking for Higgs bosons produced in pairs, a sign of the Higgs interacting with itself. That’s thought to happen at less than a thousandth the rate that individual Higgs bosons are produced in the LHC, making it extremely difficult to measure.</p>



<p>Even with the planned High-Luminosity LHC, which will eventually collect about 10 times as much data as the LHC, scientists predict that the self-coupling will be measured with large error bars of about 50&nbsp;percent, assuming the standard model is correct. That’s not enough to settle the matter.</p>



<p>If scientists just do what they’re on track to do, “we’re going to fall short,” Duarte says. But new techniques could allow physicists to better identify double-Higgs events. Duarte is studying collisions in which two particularly high-energy Higgs bosons each decay into a bottom quark and a bottom antiquark. Using a specialized machine learning technique, Duarte and colleagues put together one of the most sensitive analyses yet of this type of decay.</p>



<p>By improving this technique, and combining results with those from other researchers looking at different types of decays, “we have a good hope that we’ll be able to observe [the self-coupling] definitively,” Duarte says.</p>

<h4>Waiting game</h4>



<p>Despite all his passion for the Higgs, Duarte notes that there have been disappointments. After that first rush of the Higgs announcement, “I was hoping for a Higgs-level discovery every year.” That didn’t happen. But he hasn’t lost his optimism. “We expect there to be another twist and turn coming up,” he says. “We’re still hoping it’s around the corner.”</p>



<p>The wait for new physics is no shock to veterans of earlier particle hunts. Meenakshi Narain, a particle physicist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and a member of the CMS experiment, was an undergraduate student around the time the bottom quark was discovered in the 1970s. After that discovery, Narain joined the search for the top quark. Even though physicists were convinced of the particle’s existence, that hunt still took nearly 20 years, she says. And it took nearly 50 years to uncover the Higgs boson after it was postulated.</p>



<p>The standard model’s flaws make physicists confident that there must be more treasures to unearth. Because of her past experiences with the long-haul process of discovery, Narain says, “I have a lot of faith.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Those wanting to eat more healthily and save money are often advised not to go food shopping while hungry, the theory being that we make less prudent purchases when we’re more concerned with satisfying our immediate needs than thinking about long term goals. But how do other states of mind affect our purchases?</p>



<p>We’d probably not think anything of having a cup of coffee or a can of Coke before going shopping. But a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429221109247">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, finds that caffeine may have a bigger impact than we think, with participants spending more and buying more things after a caffeinated drink.</p>



<span id="more-47898"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team set up an espresso station over four days at a large chain store selling household goods in France. Each day, some shoppers were given espresso with caffeine while others were given decaf. Those who took the free coffee were asked to share the receipt for their purchases on leaving the shop, and answered questions on how excited, alert, and sleepy they felt while doing their shopping.</p>



<p>The results showed that those who had consumed caffeinated, rather than decaffeinated, espresso felt more excited and alert after drinking their coffee. They also bought a higher number of items and spent more overall. This was replicated in a second study, which took place in a city in Spain.</p>



<p>The third study, again in France, followed the same procedure, this time also tracking different product categories as well as cost. Again, drinking a caffeinated coffee before shopping led to greater spending and a greater number of purchases than drinking a non-caffeinated beverage. The <em>types</em> of items bought by caffeinated participants also differed — they were more likely than non-caffeinated participants to buy &#8220;high hedonic&#8221; items such as such as buttery or rich foods, which are considered more pleasurable than utilitarian things.</p>



<p>In a final study, students drank caffeinated or decaffeinated drinks before being asked whether they wanted to buy items from a &#8220;relaxation&#8221; category, which contained products of high hedonic value, or from a category containing more useful objects like notebooks and diaries. Participants bought less useful and more &#8220;exciting&#8221; items after drinking coffee, and again felt more excited and alert having drunk coffee — the potential mechanism for their buying and spending more. This is because we are more impulsive when we feel excited, and thus more likely to take a risk on products we might not go for when we are feeling calm.</p>



<p>This knowledge could obviously be of use to retailers — putting coffee stands or shops near the entrance of stores could make shoppers more likely to spend their money, and free coffee could potentially produce a significant return on investment. For this reason, the team argues that regulators should inform consumers of the impact of caffeine.</p>



<p>On an individual basis, the results are clearly useful too. If you are struggling with your spending at the supermarket, external factors like the cost of living crisis are probably more likely to be to blame than your own individual choices. However, being aware of the impact of caffeine could help people make small savings or at least be more aware of the potential for unplanned spending.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541620803">Elusive</a><br><em>Frank Close</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>There’s a lot more to the story of the Higgs boson than just one man named Higgs.</p>



<p>Despite the appeal of the “lone genius” narrative, it’s rare that a discovery can be attributed solely to the work of one scientist. At first, <em>Elusive</em>, a biography of Peter Higgs written by physicist and author Frank Close, seems to play into that misleading narrative: The book is subtitled “How Peter Higgs solved the mystery of mass.”</p>





<p>But the book quickly — and rightfully — veers from that path as it delves into the theoretical twists and turns that kicked off a decades-long quest for the particle known as the Higgs boson, culminating with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">its discovery in 2012</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/12, p.&nbsp;5</em>). That detection verified the mechanism by which particles gain mass. Higgs, of the University of Edinburgh, played a crucial role in establishing mass’s origins, but he was one of many contributors.</p>



<p>The habitually modest and attention-averse Higgs makes the case against himself as the one whiz behind the discovery, the book notes: According to Higgs, “my actual contribution was only a key insight right at the end of the story.”</p>



<p>The Higgs boson itself doesn’t bestow fundamental particles with mass. Instead, its discovery confirmed the correctness of a theory cooked up by Higgs and others. According to that theory, elementary particles gain mass by interacting with a field, now known as the Higgs field, that pervades all of space.</p>



<p>A paper from Higgs in 1964 was not the first to propose this process. Physicists Robert Brout and François Englert just barely beat him to it. And another team of researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobels-sharp-cuts">published the same idea just after Higgs</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/13, p. 4</em>). Crucial groundwork had already been laid by yet other scientists, and still others followed up on Higgs’ work. Higgs, however, was the one to make the pivotal point that the mass mechanism implied the existence of a new, massive particle, which could confirm the theory.</p>





<p>Despite this complicated history, scientists slapped his name on not just the particle, the Higgs boson, but also the process behind it, traditionally called the Higgs mechanism, but more recently and accurately termed the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. (Higgs has reportedly proposed calling it the “ABEGHHK’tH mechanism,” using the first letter of the last names of the parade of physicists who contributed to it, Anderson, Brout, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen, Higgs, Kibble and ’t Hooft.) The postmortem of how Higgs’ name attained outsize importance is one of the most interesting sections of <em>Elusive</em>, revealing much about the scientific sausage-making process and how it sometimes goes awry. Equally fascinating is the account of how the media embraced Higgs as a titan of physics based on his association with the boson, lofting him to a level of fame that, for Higgs, felt unwelcome and unwarranted.</p>



<p>The book admirably tackles the complexities of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism and how particles gain mass, covering details that are usually glossed over in most popular explanations. Close doesn’t shy away from nitty-gritty physics terms like “perturbation theory,” “renormalization” and “gauge invariance.” The thorniest bits are most appropriate for amateur physics aficionados who desire a deeper understanding, and those bits may require a reread before sinking in.</p>



<p>Higgs is famously not a fan of the limelight — he disappeared for several hours on the day he won a Nobel Prize for his work on mass. The physicist sometimes seems to fade into the background of this biography as well, with multiple pages passing with no appearance or contribution from Higgs. Once the scientific community got wind of the possibility of a new particle, the idea took on a life of its own, with experimental physicists leading the charge. Higgs didn’t make many contributions to the subject beyond his initial insight, which he calls “the only really original idea I’ve <em>ever</em> had.” </p>



<p>Thus, the book sometimes feels like a biography of a particle named Higgs, with the person playing a backup role. Higgs is so reserved and so private that you get the sense that Close still hasn’t quite cracked him. While interesting details of Higgs’ life and passions are revealed — for example, his fervent objection to nuclear weapons — deeper insights are missing. In the end, Higgs is, just like the particle named after him, elusive.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about temporal coding and, in particular, rank order coding. Please see the papers below for more details.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has been suggested that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fibre (PF)
synapses enables a cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) to learn to recognise PF
activity patterns. We investigate the recognition of PF patterns that have been
stored by LTD of AMPA receptors in a multi- compartmental PC model with a
passive soma. We find that a corresponding artificial neural network
outperforms a PC model with active dendrites by an order of magnitude. Removal
of the dendritic ion channels leads to a further decrease in performance.
Another effect of the active dendrites is an afterhyperpolarization response to
novel PF patterns. Thus, the LTD based storage of PF patterns can lead to a
potentiated late PC response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/28/working-memory-training-wont-make-you-more-intelligent/">Working memory training won’t make you more intelligent</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What can you do to make yourself smarter? All kinds of interventions have been designed and tried, mostly with little success. However, some studies have suggested that training working memory is effective. This has led to it becoming the most popular form of intelligence-training intervention, write the authors of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-51481-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>.</p>



<p>There have been mixed results in this area though, and, the team argues, potential problems with the methodology of some previous studies, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. (For example, some of the trials that failed to find an effect perhaps involved too little training.) So they set out to run as definitive a trial as possible. The results of their two-year longitudinal study now suggest that while working memory can indeed be improved in typically developing children, this has no impact whatsoever on intelligence.</p>



<span id="more-47890"></span>



<p>Working memory is the type that you use to consciously hold and manipulate information in your mind. No end of studies have linked better working memory scores to greater &#8220;fluid intelligence&#8221; — the sort involved in reasoning and learning. (Fluid intelligence is widely viewed as the &#8220;key ingredient&#8221; in human cognitive abilities, the team notes.) In fact, working memory has been viewed as the underpinning of fluid intelligence for decades. So it’s certainly reasonable to think that improving someone’s working memory might improve their intelligence, too.</p>



<p>The team studied 225 healthy German children, who were aged about 14 when the study began. All had their working memory and intelligence assessed at the start and end of the two-year period. To measure working memory, the team used three types of tasks, which involved letters, numbers and spatial positions (<a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/7df6295581304d6b9934ec61227ff32f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=47265">alpha span</a>, memory updating and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/n-back">N-back</a>). All required the participants to hold and manipulate chunks of information in their mind to do well.</p>



<p>About half of the children were in the intervention group. Every two weeks, they spent an hour engaged in versions of these three working memory tasks. In total, they received 40 hours of training over the study period.</p>



<p>The results showed that this extensive practice did indeed boost their performance on these tasks. Two years on, these children had got better at all three — and they did substantially better than the control group. Also, the team’s analysis suggested that the trained children experienced a more general improvement in working memory that wasn’t only restricted to the individual tasks. However, they write, “Despite the striking improvements in WM [working memory], we did not observe transfer to intelligence.”</p>



<p>Given all the data clearly linking working memory and intelligence, this prompts the question: why not?</p>



<p>There is no clear answer to that. Despite the apparent usefulness of a good working memory for reasoning and learning, perhaps something else underpins both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, and it’s that underlying X factor that explains the link between the two.</p>



<p>There are some recent meta-analyses that also cast doubt on the idea that working memory training improves intelligence, the team notes. And in fact, of all the brain-training interventions that have been explored, only one has been found to consistently and robustly improve intelligence. That, as they write, is education — a &#8220;dosage&#8221; of several hours a day of broad brain training for most weeks of the year, over many years.</p>



<p>Perhaps future work will find that a briefer intervention does reliably improve intelligence. And there’s no doubt that work in this field will continue. “Because the consequence of successful interventions would be far-reaching, research into (alternative) cognitive interventions will persist,” the team concludes. For now, though, it seems that if your goal is to become smarter, working memory training is a waste of time. </p>

                <p>A flexible sensor applied to the back of the neck could help researchers detect whiplash-induced concussions in athletes.</p>



<p>The sensor, described June 23 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, is about the size of a bandage and is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12266-6">sleeker and more accurate</a> than some instruments currently in use, says electrical engineer Nelson Sepúlveda of Michigan State University in East Lansing. “My hope is that it will lead to earlier diagnosis of concussions.”</p>



<p>Bulky accelerometers in helmets are sometimes used to monitor for concussion in football players. But since the devices are not attached directly to athletes’ bodies, the sensors are prone to false readings from sliding helmets.</p>





<p>Sepúlveda and colleagues’ patch adheres to the nape. It is made of two electrodes on an almost paper-thin piece of piezoelectric film, which generates an electric charge when stretched or compressed. When the head and neck move, the patch transmits electrical pulses to a computer. Researchers can analyze those signals to assess sudden movements that can cause concussion.</p>



<p>The team tried out the patch on the neck of a human test dummy, dropping the figure from a height of about 60 centimeters. Researchers also packed the dummy&#8217;s head with different sensors to provide a baseline level of neck strain. Data from the patch aligned with data gathered by the internal sensors more than 90 percent of the time, Sepúlveda and colleagues found.</p>



<p>The researchers are now working on incorporating a wireless transmitter into the patch for an even more streamlined design.</p>

<p>During my almost 20 years working in Africa and Low- and Middle-income countries, I have led several public health and research programs covering a broad variety of topics (Influenza and other respiratory viruses, Arboviruses, Hepatitis, Zoonotic pathogen, etc). The unique geographical characteristics of Africa make this continent a model of choice for studies on the evolution of viral populations, mechanisms of introduction and maintenance of viruses in regions with several bio-climates and important ecological diversity. This environment, where the proportion of endemism is among the highest in the world, also offers the opportunity to elucidate new epidemiological systems and organisms, and to test innovative models of disease surveillance.</p>
<p>My &#8220;philosophy&#8221; during my years spent in Madagascar and working in Africa was to develop research programs of interest both at the local and international level, and to train/mentor young African scientists in order for them to develop and manage their own research projects.</p>

This lack of knowledge impacts the management of patients. The research program that we have developed since 2020 is aimed at increasing our knowledge of the viral etiologies of encephalitis in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal. To explore this, we have implemented a multi-pathogen diagnostic platform that enables clinicians to receive results within 24h, thus accelerating the adapted management of patients. The innovation of our approach for the country is to test not only cerebrospinal fluids but also other biological specimens like nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples. We published our first observational study in April 2022 where we demonstrated the high mortality rate (41%) among viral encephalitis patients. We also noted that SARS-CoV-2 seems to play a significant role in patients presenting with encephalitis. Besides the challenges due to limited funds available for neglected diseases, we hope that our results will allow us to better characterize the clinical spectrum of viral encephalitis, identify potential risk factors and improve healthcare by giving patients access to better treatment. Our final aim is to develop a network of hospital-based encephalitis surveillance not only in Senegal, but in West-Africa region.</p>

Although most of my research relates to Sustainable Development Goal 3.3 (<em>By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases</em>), I have a personal interest in developing new and more inclusive approaches to tackle diseases, in particular in the region with poor access to healthcare. For that I consider embracing several SDGs in particular SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality education), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and 7 (Affordable and Clean energy) through synergies of different programs could enable reaching some of the 2030 SDGs goals.</p>
<p>As Louis Pasteur once said: “Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.” As a scientist that has worked for decades on infectious diseases and public health, it will be a great personal achievement shall I play a role in the reduction of morbidity and mortality due to viruses, making the use of global and sustainable approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">Here’s what we know right now about getting COVID-19 again</a></h4>

              
                <p>Not long before the end of the school year, my husband and I received an e-mail from our fifth-grader’s principal that may now be all-too-familiar to many parents. The subject line included the words, “MULTIPLE COVID CASES.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several students in my daughter’s class had tested positive for COVID-19. Her school acted fast. It reinstated a mask mandate for 10 days and required students not up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations to quarantine.</p>



<p>These precautions may have helped — my daughter didn’t end up bringing the virus home. But for kids who do, COVID-19 can hopscotch through households, knocking down relatives one by one. And it’s not clear how long one infection protects you from a second round with the virus.</p>





<p>Recent high-profile cases have put reinfections in the spotlight. Health and Human Services Secretary <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/13/statement-assistant-secretary-public-affairs-sarah-lovenheim-hhs-secretary-becerra-testing-positive-covid-19.html">Xavier Becerra</a> has had two bouts of COVID-19 <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/18/statement-from-assistant-secretary-for-public-affairs-sarah-lovenheim-on-hhs-delegation-traveling-in-berlin.html">in less than a month</a>. So has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9yFl5LpsaI"><em>The Late Show</em></a> host <a href="https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/1523764952124719104?s=20&amp;t=nGUw78SCnhREhSCQ0dlUeg">Stephen Colbert</a>. Back at his desk in May, he joked, “You know what they say. ‘Give me COVID once, shame on you. Give me COVID twice, please stop giving me COVID.’”</p>



<p>Just a few months ago, scientists thought <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">reinfections were relatively rare</a>, occurring most often in unvaccinated people (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). But there are signs the number may be ticking up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An ABC News investigation that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/americans-reinfected-covid-19-variants-emerge-data-shows/story?id=85114588">contacted health departments in every state</a> reported June 8 that more people seem to be getting the virus again. And omicron, the variant that sparked last winter’s surge, is still spawning sneaky subvariants. Some can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04980-y">evade antibodies produced after infection with the original omicron strain</a>, scientists report June 17 in <em>Nature</em>. That means a prior COVID-19 infection might not be as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">helpful against future infections</a> as it once was (<em>SN:8/19/21</em>). What’s more, reinfection could even <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1749502/v1">add to a person’s risk of hospitalization or other adverse outcomes</a>, a preliminary study suggests.</p>



<p>Scientists are still working to pin down the rate of reinfection. Like most questions involving <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-data-surge-spread-testing-wastewater-yankee-candles">COVID-19 case numbers</a>, the answer is more than a little murky. “You really need to have a cohort of people who are well followed and tested every time they have symptoms,” says Caroline Quach-Thanh, an infectious diseases specialist at CHU Sainte-Justine, a pediatric hospital at the University of Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent look at hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases among people in the province of Quebec found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274455v2">roughly 4 percent were reinfections</a>, scientists report in a preliminary study posted May 3 at medRxiv.org (<em>SN:5/27/22</em>). Quach-Thanh has seen an even smaller rate in her own study of health care workers first infected between March and September of 2020. Those data are still unpublished, but she points out that most of the people in her study were vaccinated. “A natural infection with three doses of vaccines protects better than just a natural infection,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many families, mine included, gear up for summer camps and vacations, I wanted to learn more about our current COVID-19 risks. I chatted with Quach-Thanh and Anna Durbin, an infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied COVID-19 vaccines. Our conversations have been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">What’s the latest on reinfections? Is the picture changing?</h6>



<p><strong>Durbin</strong>: We have to remember that the virus strain that’s circulating now is very different from the earlier strains. Whether you’ve been infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated, your body makes an immune response to fight future infections. It recognizes [the strain] your body originally saw. But as the virus changes, as it did with omicron, it becomes sort of a fuzzier picture for the immune system. It’s not recognizing the virus as well, and that’s why we’re seeing reinfections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll also say that reinfections — particularly with respiratory viruses — are very common.</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">How can scientists distinguish a true reinfection from a relapse of an original infection?</h6>



<p><strong>Quach-Thanh</strong><strong>: </strong>There are multiple ways of looking at this. The first is looking at the time elapsed between the first infection and a new positive PCR test. If it has been more than three months, it is unlikely to be just a remnant of a previous infection. We can also look at viral load. A really high viral load usually means it’s a new infection. But the best way to tell is to sequence the virus [to determine its genetic makeup] to see if it is actually a new strain.&nbsp;</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">What do we know about the health risks of reinfection?</h6>



<p><strong>Quach-Thanh: </strong>The good thing is that most of the people who got reinfected [in the Quebec study] got a mild disease, and the risk of hospitalization and death was much lower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you get reinfected, you might [have symptoms] like a cold, or even sometimes a cough, and a little bit of a fever, but you usually don’t progress to complications as much as you would with your first infection — if you’re vaccinated.</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">Does reinfection increase your chance of developing long COVID?</h6>



<p><strong>Durbin</strong>: I think that’s unknown, but it’s being studied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look back at the omicron wave in the U.S. that happened in January and February, now is about the time we would start to see symptoms of long COVID. So far it looks promising. We seem to be seeing a lower incidence of long COVID [after reinfection with omicron] than we did with primary infection, but those data are going to continue to be collected over the next few months.</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">At this point in the pandemic, how cautious do we need to be?</h6>



<p><strong>Quach-Thanh: </strong>It depends on your baseline risk of complications. If you’re healthy, if you’re doing most activities outdoors, if you’re vaccinated, life can proceed. But if you’re immune suppressed or elderly, the situation might be different.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>If you have symptoms, it would be advisable to not mingle in indoor settings without a mask so that you don’t contaminate other people. There are immunocompromised people who might be at risk of serious infection. We still need to keep them in mind. I think we have to be responsible, and if we’re sick, we should get tested.</p>



<p><strong>Durbin:</strong> This is what I tell my friends, family and patients: This virus is here to stay. Any time you’re in a crowded place with poor ventilation and lots of people, there’s a chance there&#8217;s going to be transmission. The risk is never going to be zero. It’s a message people don’t want to hear. But as long as there are people to infect, this virus is not going away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have to move to acceptance, and we have to be better members of society. If we can, we should stay home when we’re sick. If we can’t stay home, we should wear a mask. We should wash our hands regularly. These are things that work to reduce transmission.</p>



<p>They reduce your risk of getting not just COVID-19, but also a cold or the flu.</p>



<h6 style="padding-bottom:15px">Can we anticipate another surge in cases?</h6>



<p><strong>Quach-Thanh: </strong>I think the next wave will come in the fall. The problem with this virus is that it mutates. And as long as it’s transmitted, it will continue to mutate.</p>



<h6>What can we look forward to?&nbsp;</h6>



<p><strong>Durbin</strong>: I think <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-kids-babies-under-5-fda-united-states">young kids getting vaccinated</a> is going to reduce the ability of the virus to spread (<em>SN: 6/17/22</em>). That’s good news.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-tools-england-hominids-gravel-pits">Britons’ tools from 560,000 years ago have emerged from gravel pits</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the 1920s, laborers and amateur archaeologists at gravel quarry pits in southeastern England uncovered more than 300 ancient, sharp-edged oval tools. Researchers have long suspected that these hand axes were made 500,000 to 700,000 years ago. A new study confirms that suspicion in the first systematic excavation of the site, known as Fordwich.</p>



<p>Dating those tools and more recent finds suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.211904">humanlike folk inhabited the area between about 560,000 and 620,000 years ago</a>, researchers report in the June <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>. Relatively warm conditions at that time drew hominids to what&#8217;s now northern Europe before the evolutionary rise of Neandertals and <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>





<p>The results confirm that Fordwich is one of the oldest hominid sites in England. Previous discoveries place <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-hominids-grabbed-early-northern-exposure">hominids in what&#8217;s now southeastern England at least 840,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/10</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nearly-1-million-year-old-european-footprints-found">perhaps as far back as nearly 1 million years ago</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/14</em>). No hominid fossils have been found at Fordwich. It’s unclear which species of the human genus made the tools.</p>



<p>In 2020, archaeologist Alastair Key of the University of Cambridge and colleagues unearthed 238 stone artifacts at Fordwich that display grooves created by striking the surface with another stone. Other finds include three stones with resharpened edges, presumably used to scrape objects like animal hides.</p>



<p>A method for determining when sediment layers were last exposed to sunlight indicated that the newly discovered artifacts date to roughly 542,000 years ago. The previously unearthed hand axes probably came from the same sediment.</p>



<p>Hominids must have fashioned tools at Fordwich a bit earlier than 542,000 years ago because ancient climate data suggest that an ice age at that time made it hard to survive in northern Europe, the team concludes. Warmer conditions between 560,000 and 620,000 years ago would have enabled the hominid toolmakers to live so far north.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/february-2018/n-narcissism">Narcissists</a> feel that they are exceptional, and don’t get the recognition they deserve. But narcissistic beliefs can apply to a group, too. Feeling that your nation, religion, organisation, or political party is superior but under-appreciated is known as &#8220;<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/09/theres-such-a-thing-as-collective-narcissism-and-it-might-explain-a-lot-thats-going-on-at-the-moment/">collective narcissism</a>&#8220;. And now a team led by Mikey Biddlestone at the University of Cambridge reports that collective narcissists are more willing to conspire against other members of their own group. </p>



<span id="more-47885"></span>



<p>The team’s <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjop.12569">paper</a>, in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em>, reports studies on people from Poland, the UK, and the US. In the first study, 361 Polish participants completed various questionnaires, including one that measured national narcissism using items such as &#8220;If Poles had a major say in the world the world would be a much better place&#8221;. An additional measure of &#8220;National identification&#8221; tapped into a happier, more secure sense of national feeling — &#8220;I feel strong ties to other Polish people&#8221;, for example. The participants also completed a brief scale that assessed whether, if they held a government position, they would be willing to wiretap fellow citizens, &#8220;spread false information if the situation required it&#8221;, and perform Internet surveillance without the consent of the citizens being observed.</p>



<p>Once any overlap between the participants’ national narcissism and national identification was accounted for in the analysis, those who’d scored highly for national narcissism were more likely to say they’d conspire against fellow citizens. In contrast, high national identification scores were linked to a lower willingness to conspire.</p>



<p>A subsequent study on 471 US-based participants incorporated even more extreme potential actions — such as a willingness to aid in the concealment of efforts that could lead to the spread of viruses, or even, “if necessary”, to work with the government to carry out domestic acts of terrorism. People who scored higher in national narcissism were more willing to engage in these conspiracies — even though doing so could clearly harm fellow citizens.</p>



<p>In a later study, again on Polish participants, the team found that national narcissism predicted willingness to conspire against the in-group over and above other political and personality factors, such as scores for Machiavellianism or psychopathy. There was also another interesting finding from this study: those with high national narcissism scores were only willing to conspire against those they perceived to be typical, genuine members of their nation. “Collective narcissists might… view typical, yet disloyal in-group members as the most threatening to the in-group image, making them likely targets of conspiracies,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The UK study looked not at national but workplace narcissism. These participants were asked about their willingness to collude in spreading false information about other members of their team at work, or conspire against them in various other ways, in a bid to gain an advantage over them. This time, however, there was no clear link between collective narcissism scores and a willingness to conspire against the in-group.</p>



<p>For the studies looking at national narcissism, though, the results were consistent. “While traditional accounts of in-group identity might suggest that people are willing to act against outgroups rather than in-groups, we show that this might not be true for certain forms of in-group identity,” the researchers observe.</p>



<p>What might explain this? Collective narcissism is thought to compensate for frustrated individual needs, such as feelings of powerlessness. For these people, the group serves those needs — giving them an enhanced sense of power, for example. Acting against fellow members might further boost feelings of power.</p>



<p>It’s also possible that collective narcissists are more willing to conspire against fellow group members because they project their own willingness to conspire on to them. Indeed, some of the data suggests that this is the case.</p>



<p>However, it’s worth stressing that the links reported by the team are all correlational; there could be alternative or additional explanations. As the researchers point out, if collective narcissists are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories in general, this might fuel a culture of intra-group suspicion and paranoia, making in-group conspiracy narratives more believable. Also, only in one of the studies —&nbsp;on workplace teams —&nbsp;were the participants asked to think about people they actually knew personally. And of course this study did not find a clear link between collective narcissism and a willingness to conspire against the in-group. Perhaps this link manifests only when the group is so big that the individual has no personal connection with the people they would be targeting.</p>



<p>Overall, though, the work suggests that we should be wary of fellow group members who show signs of collective narcissism. “Even though collective narcissists seem to always be on the lookout for others threatening their group, eventually they might end up being their own group’s worst enemies,” the team concludes.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-discovery-just-beginning-anniversary">The Higgs boson discovery was just the beginning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emily Conover spent one of the most consequential moments in recent physics history in a cavern near a nuclear power plant in France.</p>



<p>At the time, Conover was a Ph.D. student in particle physics (she’s now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/emily-conover">physics senior writer</a> for <em>Science News</em>). She was part of a team building a detector in the cavern to observe elusive particles called neutrinos. It was the Fourth of July 2012. A few hundred kilometers away, scientists were announcing the discovery of another elusive subatomic particle, the Higgs boson, which physicists had been hunting for decades. As hundreds of researchers cheered in the main auditorium at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva, Conover and the small group of physicists in the chilly French cavern cheered too, as did scientists worldwide. The Higgs boson filled in a missing piece in the standard model of particle physics, which explains just about everything known about the particles that make up atoms and transmit the forces of nature. No Higgs boson, no life as we know it.</p>





<p>In this issue’s cover story, “The Higgs boson at 10,” Conover looks back at the excitement around <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">the discovery of the Higgs boson</a> and looks ahead to the many things that researchers hope to find out with its help. She also reviews a new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elusive-book-peter-higgs-boson-mass-physics">biography of Peter Higgs</a>, a modest man who made clear that he was just one of many scientists who contributed to the breakthrough.</p>



<p>The discovery is part of <em>Science News</em> history too. Journalists around the world were eagerly awaiting the big announcement, which was being kept under wraps. But when Kate Travis, a <em>Science News</em> editor at the time, uncovered an announcement video accidentally posted early on CERN’s website, we published the big news the day before the official announcement. </p>



<p>“Even though its discovery is 10 years old now, that’s still new in the grand scheme of particle physics, so we’re still learning lots about it,” Conover told me. “It’s very cool that I get the opportunity to write about this particle that is still so new to science.” And it’s very cool that we get to explore it with her.</p>

<h4>Meaty data</h4>



<p><em>Food production contributes substantially to global greenhouse gas emissions. Altering your diet can reduce those emissions, <strong>Betsy Ladyzhets</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">Food choices</a>” (</em>SN:&nbsp;5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story displayed a map showing the impact of an average person’s diet, by country, on greenhouse gas emissions (see “Putting emissions on the map,” below). Reader <strong>Steve Woodbury</strong> wondered whether the map depicts emissions attributable to countries’ consumption or exportation of food products.</p>



<p>On this map, the greenhouse gas emissions are counted only in the country where the food use is happening, <strong>Ladyzhets</strong> says. The scientists who worked on this analysis chose to focus on modeling consumption habits because “the majority of food produced in most countries is consumed domestically,” she says.</p>

<h3>Putting emissions on the map</h3>



<p>At least one reader wanted to know more about a map that shows how countries’ average diets contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions. The map captures emissions from food production, but not from processing, transportation, retail or waste. Data are not available for countries in gray.</p>

<h4>All about the fight</h4>



<p><em>A hole in the skull of a </em>Triceratops<em> dubbed “Big John” may have been a battle scar sustained during a fight with a peer, <strong>Anna Gibbs</strong> reported in “</em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/triceratops-dinosaur-hole-skeleton-combat-big-john">Triceratops<em> hole may be a combat injury</em></a><em>” (</em>SN:&nbsp;5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 20<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Dale S. Smith</strong> asked how scientists know that Big John was male, and whether the injury could have resulted from mating with a female.</p>



<p>We know that Big John is most likely male because of the morphology and measurements of the skeleton, particularly the skull and pelvis, says <strong>Ruggero D’Anastasio</strong>, a paleopathologist at the “G. D’Annunzio” University of Chieti-Pescara in Italy.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that the injury happened during mating, <strong>D’Anastasio</strong> says. The location and shape of the wound indicates that it was inflicted from behind, which is probably not where a female <em>Triceratops </em>would be positioned during mating, he says. The shape of the hole also suggests that a large horn penetrated perpendicular to the skull’s bony frill. If the injury was sustained during mating, the lesion would likely have a different shape, caused by a big horn that pierced the skull’s fan at an acute rather than perpendicular angle, he says.</p>



<p>But it’s possible that mating rivalry had a part in the brawl. “In many animal species, males struggle with each other to acquire the right to mate with females,” <strong>D’Anastasio</strong> says. “It is all about fighting.”</p>



<h4>Mass mismatch</h4>



<p><em>A new measurement suggests the W boson may have a higher mass than expected, revealing a potential flaw in the standard model of particle physics, <strong>Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">Subatomic particle may be extra hefty</a>” (</em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>The W boson’s newly measured mass is 80,433.5 million electron volts, <strong>Conover </strong>reported. That exceeds the predicted mass of 80,357 MeV by roughly 0.1 percent. Reader <strong>Jerry Boehm</strong> asked if such a tiny discrepancy is significant enough for scientists to discuss the prospect of new particles.</p>



<p>In short, yes, <strong>Conover</strong> says. “Even though that sounds like a very small mismatch, physicists have determined the measured and predicted W&nbsp;boson masses so precisely that the discrepancy is much bigger than expected,” she says. “The W&nbsp;boson mass was measured to a precision of 0.01 percent, similar to that of the predicted mass. So we’d expect those values to be much closer together, unless we’re missing something. That ‘something’ could be an exciting find, like new particles, or it could mean that there’s something else that’s not accounted for properly in either the measurement or the prediction.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-who-not-global-public-health-emergency">Monkeypox is not a global health emergency for now, WHO says</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeypox is not yet a global public health emergency, the World Health Organization said June 25. </p>



<p>The decision comes as the outbreak of the disease related to smallpox continues to spread, affecting at least <a href="https://map.monkeypox.global.health/country">4,100 people in 46 countries</a> as of June 24. That includes at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html">201 cases in the United States</a>. Those cases have been found in 25 states and the District of Columbia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>





<p>&#8220;Controlling the further spread of outbreak requires intense response efforts,&#8221; and the situation should be reevaluated in a few weeks, the WHO committee evaluating the outbreak <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-06-2022-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee--regarding-the-multi-country-monkeypox-outbreak">said in an announcement</a>.</p>



<p>The declaration of a public health emergency would have potentially made it easier to get treatments and vaccines to people infected with or exposed to the virus. Some medications and vaccines that could help fend off monkeypox are approved for use against smallpox, and can be used against monkeypox only with special authorization.</p>



<p>The virus that causes monkeypox, named for its discovery in monkeys in 1958 though it is probably a virus that mainly infects rodents, is not a new threat. Countries in central Africa, where monkeypox is endemic, have had sporadic outbreaks since researchers found the first human case in 1970. Places in western Africa had few cases until 2017. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">most cases outside the continent were travel-related</a>, with limited spread to others (<em>SN: 5/26/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Monkeypox has been circulating in a number of African countries for decades and has been neglected in terms of research, attention and funding,&#8221; WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus said in a statement announcing the decision. &#8220;This must change not just for monkeypox but for other neglected diseases in low-income countries as the world is reminded yet again that health is an interconnected proposition.&#8221;</p>



<p>Monkeypox typically kills fewer than 10 percent of people who contract it. At least <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/speeches/item/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-multi-country-monkeypox-outbreak---23-june-2022">one person has died</a> in the global outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As case numbers climb, researchers are working to decipher the genetic blueprint of the virus, in hopes of uncovering whether some viral mutations might explain why the virus has quickly gained a foothold in new places.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Tracing the mutations</h4>



<p>The closest known relative of the versions of the virus behind the global outbreak comes from Nigeria, hinting that the outbreak may have got its start there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the newest surge in cases, scientists have uncovered more viral changes than anticipated — a sign that the virus may have been circulating undetected among people for a while, perhaps since Nigeria’s 2017–2018 monkeypox outbreak, new research suggests. What’s more, a group of enzymes known for their virus-fighting abilities in the body may be to blame for many of those mutations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A genetic analysis of monkeypox viruses involved in the global outbreak from 15 people across seven countries shows that these viruses <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01907-y">have an average of 50 more genetic tweaks</a> than versions circulating in 2018 and 2019, researchers report June 24 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. That’s roughly six to 12 times as many mutations as scientists would have expected the virus to develop over that time. Unlike some other types of viruses, poxviruses, which include smallpox and monkeypox viruses, typically mutate fairly slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes have a pattern that is a hallmark of an enzyme family called APOBEC3, the researchers say. These enzymes edit DNA’s building blocks — represented by the letters G, C, A and T — in a specific way: Gs change to As and Cs to Ts. The analysis found that particular pattern in the viral sequences, suggesting that APOBEC3s are responsible for the mutations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, so many DNA building blocks are swapped for another that a virus is effectively destroyed and can’t infect more cells. But, sometimes, APOBEC3 enzymes don’t make enough changes to knock out the virus. Such mutated, though still functional, viruses can go on to infect additional cells, and possibly another person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A big question, though, is whether the genetic tweaks seen in the monkeypox virus are helpful, harmful or have no effect at all on the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s still unknown whether the enzymes are directly responsible for the changes in the monkeypox virus, similar mutations are still popping up, the team found. So, APOBEC3s may still be helping the virus change as it continues to spread. One member of the enzyme family is found in skin cells, where people with monkeypox can develop infectious pox lesions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Different symptoms</h4>



<p>Symptoms reported in the global outbreak have been generally milder than those reported in previous outbreaks, perhaps allowing the disease to spread before a person knows they’re infected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not clear whether those differences in symptoms are related to changes in the virus, Inger Damon, director of the CDC’s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, said June 21 in a <a href="https://sciline.org/public-health/monkeypox-update/#video-transcript">news briefing</a> hosted by SciLine, a service for journalists and scientists sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, in previous outbreaks, people would develop flu-like symptoms, including fever, headaches, muscle aches and exhaustion about a week or two after exposure to the virus. Then, one to three days after those symptoms start, a rash including large pus-filled lesions pops up generally starting on the face and limbs, particularly the hands, and spreads over the body. Though generally milder, those symptoms are similar to smallpox, but people with monkeypox also tend to develop swollen lymph nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All patients in the U.S. outbreak have gotten rashes, Damon said, “but the lesions have been scattered or localized to a specific body site, rather than diffuse, and have not generally involved the face or the … palms of the hand or the soles of the feet.” Instead, rashes may start in the genital or anal area where they can be mistaken for sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis or herpes, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, the rashes have not spread to other parts of the body. And the classical early symptoms such as fever have been “mild and sometimes nonexistent before a rash appears,” Damon said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monkeypox is transmitted from person to person through close skin-to-skin contact or by contact with contaminated towels, clothes or bedding. It may also be spread by droplets of saliva exchanged during kissing or other intimate contact. The CDC is investigating whether the virus might be spread by semen as well as skin-to-skin contact during sex, Agam Rao, a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service, said June 23 at a meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p>



<p>“We don’t have any reason to suspect it is spread any other way,” such as through the air, Rao said.</p>



<p>In Nigeria, more monkeypox cases have been recorded among women, while the global outbreak has affected mainly men, particularly men who have sex with men. Experts warn that anyone can be infected with monkeypox, and some people face an increased risk of severe disease. Those at increased risk include children, people who are immunocompromised, pregnant people and people with eczema.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk of catching monkeypox through casual contact is still low in the United States, Rao said. But data she presented show that while people in the country have contracted monkeypox while traveling abroad, cases have also spread locally.</p>

<p>Some states have already passed laws that curtail abortion access. Now, without the federal protections Roe v. Wade provided, <a href="https://fullerproject.org/story/how-major-abortion-laws-compare-state-by-state-map/">other states will likely follow suit</a>.</p>



<p>Many of those legislative efforts invoke medical and scientific language, in an effort to define when life begins. Heart development, fetal pain and viability have all been brought into justification for abortion restrictions. But many of these rationales don’t line up with the biology of early development. Texas’ 2021 “heartbeat law,” for instance, bans abortion after about six weeks when heart cells purportedly begin thumping. At that early stage of pregnancy, there isn’t yet a fully formed heart to beat.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Like most aspects of biology, early human development involves many complex processes. &nbsp;Despite the rhetoric around these issues, clear lines — between having a heart and not having a heart or being able to survive outside of the uterus — are scarce, or nonexistent.</p>



<p>“There aren’t these set black-and-white points for much of this,” says obstetrician-gynecologist Nisha Verma, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s known about five key aspects of pregnancy biology that often come up in abortion debates.</p>



<h4>1. The early timeline of a pregnancy is easy to misunderstand.</h4>



<p>That’s because how dates are determined is supremely confusing. The standard pregnancy clock actually starts ticking <em>before</em> a sperm cell encounters an egg, two weeks before, on average. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">An ovary releases an egg</a> around day 14 of an average 28-day menstrual cycle (<em>SN: 6/19/21</em>) . (Day 1 is the first day of menstruation; day 1 is also when a pregnancy officially begins in the month an egg is fertilized.) That means that when a sperm fertilizes an egg, a person is already officially two weeks pregnant. As nonsensical as that sounds, it’s the simplest way medical professionals can date a pregnancy.</p>



<p>That timeline means that abortion bans at six weeks, enacted in Texas, Oklahoma and Idaho, take effect earlier in pregnancy than many people think, Verma says. In 2020, she surveyed people in Georgia, where she was practicing medicine at the time, about their understanding of the timing. “Some people will say the six weeks is after your first missed period,” she says. “Some people think it’s from the date of conception.” Neither is correct.</p>



<p>The ban would start four weeks after fertilization. Counting back, that’s two weeks after a missed period, which is often a person’s first indication that they might be pregnant. Such bans leave a person very little time — two weeks after a missed period — to access an abortion.</p>



<p>What’s more, these dates are based on averages. Many women have irregular menstrual cycles. Birth control isn’t 100 percent effective, and certain types can eliminate menstruation altogether, throwing even more uncertainty into the early timeline of pregnancy.</p>

<h4>By the numbers</h4>



<p>Most abortions in the United States happen very early in pregnancy, data collected in 2019 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Fewer than 5 percent of abortions are done at or after week 16 of pregnancy. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>2. Pregnancy takes more than sperm meeting egg.</h4>



<p>That meeting, which usually takes place in one of the two fallopian tubes near the ovaries, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/images-reveal-secrets-zinc-sparks">fertilization</a>, a process in which two cells fuse and mingle their genetic contents, creating what’s known as a zygote (<em>SN: 1/10/15</em>). But a fertilized egg does not automatically lead to a pregnancy, says obstetrician and gynecologist Jonas Swartz of Duke University School of Medicine. “Equating them doesn’t make sense from a medical standpoint.” Up to 50 percent of fertilized eggs do not implant in the uterus, researchers have estimated.</p>



<p>The genetic material needs to combine in the right way. The growing ball of cells needs to travel to the uterus and implant itself in the right spot. And the right balance of hormones need to be churned out to support the pregnancy. “There are so many things other than the sperm meeting the egg that actually matter for this to become a pregnancy that has a chance to develop further,” says Selina Sandoval, an obstetrician and gynecologist who specializes in complex family planning at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Lawmakers in some states are considering abortion rules that apply to a fertilized egg; Oklahoma had already passed such a law. That includes fertilized eggs that lodge in the wrong spot, the fallopian tube, for example. Called an ectopic pregnancy, this can lead to life-threatening medical emergencies when the growing tissue ruptures the tube and internal bleeding ensues. “These are pregnancies that under no circumstance can become a healthy pregnancy,” Sandoval says. “In fact, if they aren’t treated and continue to grow, they will kill the patient.” Laws that apply to a fertilized egg could “limit our ability to treat patients for ectopic pregnancies,” she says.</p>



<h4>3. “Heartbeat laws” are not what they seem.</h4>



<p>A Texas law bans abortions “after detection of an unborn child’s heartbeat.” But the rhythmic sounds heard on an ultrasound early in pregnancy aren’t caused by the opening and closing of heart valves as they move blood through the heart’s chambers, the motion that produces a typical <em>lub dub</em> sound. That’s because those chambers haven’t yet developed. On early ultrasounds, the heartbeat-like sounds are created by the ultrasound machine itself.</p>



<p>“What we’re seeing is actually the primitive heart tube and the cells in that heart tube having electrical activity that causes fluttering,” Verma says. “The ultrasound is actually manufacturing that sound based on the electrical activity and fluttering motion.”</p>



<p>Using the term “heartbeat” to describe the fluttering makes sense in some situations, like in conversations with excited parents-to-be, Verma says. “I’ve taken care of countless people who have seen that first ‘heartbeat’ on ultrasound for a desired pregnancy, and it’s this huge, exciting moment,” she says. “I don’t want to be dismissive of that.” She says two things can be true at the same time: “It can be exciting for a patient. It also isn’t a scientific thing.”</p>



<h4>4. Fetal pain is difficult to define.</h4>



<p>A bit of biology that’s often used to restrict abortions is the claim that fetuses (which form at week 11 of pregnancy) feel pain.</p>



<p>“Pain is very complex,” Swartz says. “It requires not just a physical response, but the ability to suffer as a result.”</p>



<p>Knowing what a fetus experiences is impossible, but brain development studies provide some clues. The experience of pain starts with the senses detecting something noxious. Those signals then have to travel to the cortex, the outer layer of the brain that helps interpret that sensation. In human fetuses, those brain connections don’t exist until about week 24 or 25 of pregnancy. In guidelines written by members of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, researchers write that these connections are necessary for the experience of pain, but are not sufficient on their own to conclude that pain is possible.</p>



<p>In human fetuses, these connections aren’t actually operational until about week 28 or 29 of pregnancy, other studies suggest. “We can say with really, really good confidence that no sooner than 28 weeks is [pain] even possible,” Sandoval says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vast majority of abortions — over 90 percent — happen in the first trimester, before week 13 of pregnancy. The number of abortions after 24 or 25 weeks is “vanishingly small,” Swartz says.</p>



<h4>5. When a fetus could survive on its own is a complex medical calculation.</h4>



<p>The word “viability” is often used as a sharp cut-off point to mark the age at which a fetus could survive outside of the uterus. The problem is that one clear cut-off does not exist.</p>



<p>“That has been a moving line as science has advanced and our ability to support very small babies has advanced,” Swartz says. “But it’s also not a fixed line for babies born now.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, babies born around 22 to 24 weeks gestation either don’t survive or they survive with major health problems. Whether a fetus will survive if delivered depends on a whole suite of other factors, Swartz says. They include fetal sex, weight, developmental issues and mother’s health, not to mention individual health care facilities’ capabilities and training.</p>



<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently removed mentions of “viability” in their guidance on abortion care. “It’s such a complicated concept that we can’t make blanket statements about it,” Verma says. “It’s something that needs to be left to the clinician looking at the patient.”</p>



<p>Inaccurate descriptions of biology can influence restrictions around reproductive health, and as a result, the health care people are able to receive, Swartz says. A colleague of his, for instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352854/">wasn’t able to get appropriate medical care</a> when she experienced signs of a pregnancy loss. Because of state abortion restrictions, her physician decided to delay treatment, an emotionally distressing experience she wrote about last year in <em>Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>. Abortion regulations based on flawed medical and scientific premises, Swartz says, “places priority on a potential life over the actual life of the person sitting in front of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Does the eel use electric fields to navigate?</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/does-eel-use-electric-fields-navigate"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 24, 1972</p>



<p>Many species of ocean fish [such as American eels] migrate over large distances. Some of them do so with such extreme accuracy that they can come thousands of miles to return to the stream or area where they were born. Naturalists naturally wonder how they do it. One of the suggestions is that they use electricity.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>It’s still a mystery how the American eel (<em>Anguilla rostrata</em>) navigates to its breeding grounds. But a growing body of evidence has shifted focus from electricity to magnetic fields. Experiments suggest that the American eel’s European cousin, <em>A</em>.&nbsp;<em>anguilla</em>, seems to follow <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217302841">a magnetic map</a> to the North Atlantic’s Sargasso Sea, guided by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602007">an internal compass</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/13/17</em>). In March, scientists proposed that freshly spawned A­merican and European eels follow paths of increasing magnetic intensity from the Sargasso Sea to their freshwater homes. As adults, the eels may <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12621">sense decreasing intensity to retrace the path</a> to their birthplace.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-oldest-wildfire-430-million-years-ago-fossil-charcoal">Earth’s oldest known wildfires raged 430 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bits of charcoal entombed in ancient rocks unearthed in Wales and Poland push back the earliest evidence for wildfires to around 430 million years ago. Besides breaking the previous record by about 10 million years, the finds help pin down how much oxygen was in Earth’s atmosphere at the time.</p>



<p>The ancient atmosphere must have contained <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G50193.1/614348/Silurian-wildfire-proxies-and-atmospheric-oxygen">at least 16 percent oxygen</a>, researchers report June 13 in <em>Geology</em>. That conclusion is based on modern-day lab tests that show how much oxygen it takes for a wildfire to take hold and spread.</p>





<p>While oxygen makes up 21 percent of our air today, over the last 600 million years or so, oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changes-air">fluctuated between 13 percent and 30 percent</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/05</em>). Long-term models simulating past oxygen concentrations are based on processes such as the burial of coal swamps, mountain building, erosion and the chemical changes associated with them. But those models, some of which predict lower oxygen levels as low as 10 percent for this time period, provide broad-brush strokes of trends and may not capture brief spikes and dips, say Ian Glasspool and Robert Gastaldo, both paleobotanists at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.</p>



<p>Charcoal, a remnant of wildfire, is physical evidence that provides, at the least, a minimum threshold for oxygen concentrations. That’s because oxygen is one of three ingredients needed to create a wildfire. The second, ignition, came from lightning in the ancient world, says Glasspool. The third, fuel, came from burgeoning plants and fungus 430 million years ago, during the Silurian Period. The predominant greenery were low-growing plants just a couple of centimeters tall. Scattered among this diminutive ground cover were occasional knee-high to waist-high plants and <em>Prototaxites </em>fungi that towered up to nine meters tall. Before this time, most plants were single-celled and lived in the seas.</p>



<p>Once plants left the ocean and began to thrive, wildfire followed. “Almost as soon as we have evidence of plants on land, we have evidence of wildfire,” says Glasspool.</p>



<p>That evidence includes tiny chunks of partially charred plants — including charcoal as identified by its microstructure — as well as conglomerations of charcoal and associated minerals embedded within fossilized hunks of <em>Prototaxites </em>fungi. Those samples came from rocks of known ages that formed from sediments dumped just offshore of ancient landmasses. This wildfire debris was carried offshore in streams or rivers before it settled, accumulated and was preserved, the researchers suggest.</p>

<p>The discovery adds to previous evidence, including analyses of pockets of fluid trapped in halite minerals formed during the Silurian, that suggests that atmospheric oxygen during that time approached or even exceeded the 21 percent concentration seen today, the pair note.</p>



<p>“The team has good evidence for charring,” says Lee Kump, a biogeochemist at Penn State who wasn’t involved in the new study. Although its evidence points to higher oxygen levels than some models suggest for that time, it’s possible that oxygen was a substantial component of the atmosphere even earlier than the Silurian, he says.</p>



<p>“We can’t rule out that oxygen levels weren’t higher even further back,” says Kump. “It could be that plants from that era weren’t amenable to leaving a charcoal record.”</p>

<p>What kind of person wants to watch a movie where a boatload of people gets gruesomely cut in half by a wire, or where a man saws off his own foot to escape the sadistic games of a serial killer? You’d have to be pretty coldhearted and cruel to enjoy that kind of thing, right?</p>



<p>That’s certainly how horror fans have historically been portrayed, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/how-the-moral-hysteria-of-the-1980s-spawned-a-cult-horr-1846989837">at least by some commentators</a>. But a new study finds no evidence for this stereotype. Fans of horror films are just as kind and compassionate as everyone else, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rhc23">according to the preprint</a> published on <em>PsyArXiv</em> — and in some respects may be <em>more</em> so.</p>



<span id="more-47877"></span>



<p>First, Coltan Scrivner from Aarhus University examined whether people really do believe that horror fans lack empathy or compassion. He asked 201 participants to view a series of profiles which each presented information about a person, including their age, name, and favourite genre of movie: action, comedy, drama, or horror. Participants had to judge how kind, empathetic, and compassionate each person was.</p>



<p>Participants did indeed see horror fans in a more negative light: they rated these people as significantly less kind than comedy, drama or action fans, and less empathetic and compassionate than comedy or drama fans.</p>



<p>Scrivner then set out to see whether there was any truth to this stereotype. A new group of 244 participants rated the extent to which they enjoyed five sub-genres of horror film: gore/splatter, monster, paranormal, psychological, and slasher. They also completed measures of cognitive empathy (which is about understanding what another person is feeling) and affective empathy (which concerns the ability to share and experience their emotions), as well as a measure of “coldheartedness”, or disregard for others’ wellbeing.</p>



<p>Participants who reported greater enjoyment of the various kinds of horror didn’t score any lower on empathy or higher on coldheartedness. In most cases, enjoyment of horror films wasn’t significantly related to scores on these measures at all, but there were a few instances where horror fans actually seemed <em>more</em> pro-social. For instance, people who enjoyed gore/splatter films had significantly greater cognitive empathy, while those who liked paranormal films scored higher on both kinds of empathy, and lower on coldheartedness. And <em>overall</em> enjoyment of horror across genres was related to lower coldheartness and higher cognitive empathy.</p>



<p>These results suggest that the caricature of the anti-social, depraved horror fan is false. But, Scrivner reasoned, perhaps horror fans <em>act</em> less compassionately or empathetically, even if they don’t score any differently on scales measuring these traits. So, one to two weeks later, the same participants were each told that there were leftover funds from the previous study, and that they had been selected to receive an extra $0.50, alongside half of the other participants. They could choose to donate any amount of this money to another participant who had not received the bonus.</p>



<p>Just over half of participants opted to donate some of the money — but the amount donated was not related to how much they enjoyed horror, or any of the sub-genres of horror. This suggests that people who like horror films act just as kindly and compassionately as others, Scrivner concludes.</p>



<p>The results are hopefully not that surprising — most of us have moved on from the moral panic over “video nasties”, and recognise that we’re unlikely to become corrupted by the media we consume. But it’s nice to see that demonstrated, empirically. </p>



<p>And this isn’t the only study to do so. Just as horror enthusiasts remain as kind and compassionate as everyone else, players of violent video games <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/">don’t become more aggressive</a>, and fans of heavy metal <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/04/the-scaremongers-were-wrong-metalheads-from-the-80s-are-thriving/">are just as well-adjusted as pop and rock</a> aficionados. If there’s a broader message to all this work, it’s that we should let people enjoy the movies, games, and music that they like, without judging them or blaming them for society’s problems.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rhc23">Bleeding-heart horror fans: Enjoyment of horror media is not related to reduced empathy or compassion</a> [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-eukaryote-thiomargarita-magnifica-namibiensis-largest-bacterium">This giant bacterium is the largest one found yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>There&#8217;s a new record holder for biggest bacterium — and you don’t need a microscope to see it.</p>



<p>The newfound species, <em>Thiomargarita magnifica</em>, is <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb3634">roughly a centimeter long</a>, and its cells are surprisingly complex, researchers report in the June 24 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The bacterial behemoth is roughly the size and shape of a human eyelash, marine biologist Jean-Marie Volland of the Laboratory for Research in Complex Systems in Menlo Park, Calif., said June 21 at a news conference. Maxing out at approximately 2 centimeters<em>,</em> <em>T. magnifica</em> is about 50 times the size of other giant bacteria and about 5,000 times the size of most other average-size bacterial species.</p>





<p>What’s more, while the genetic material of most bacteria <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-spy-secret-inner-life-bacteria">floats freely inside the cell</a>, <em>T. magnifica </em>packs its DNA inside a sac surrounded by a membrane (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>). Such a compartment is a hallmark of the larger, more complex cells of eukaryotes, a group of organisms that includes plants and animals.</p>



<p>Study coauthor Oliver Gros, a marine biologist at the Université des Antilles Pointe-á-Pitre in Guadeloupe, France, first discovered <em>T. magnifica</em> while collecting water samples in tropical marine mangrove forests in the Caribbean’s Lesser Antilles. At first, he mistook the long, white filaments as some sort of eukaryote, Gros said at the news conference. But a few years later, genetic analyses showed that the organisms were actually bacteria. A closer look under the microscope revealed the cells’ DNA-containing sacs.</p>



<p>Previous studies had predicted that bacterial cells’ overall lack of complexity meant there was a limit to how large bacteria could grow. But the new discovery is “breaking our way of thinking about bacteria,” says Ferran Garcia-Pichel, a microbiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with the study. When it comes to bacteria, people typically think small and simple. But that mindset may make researchers miss lots of other bacterial species, Garcia-Pichel says. It&#8217;s a bit like thinking the largest animal that exists is a small frog but then scientists discover elephants.</p>



<p>It’s still unclear what role <em>T. magnifica</em> plays among the mangroves. Also unknown is why it evolved to be so large. One possibility, Volland said, is that being centimeters long helps cells access both oxygen and sulfide, which the bacteria need to survive.</p>

                <p>Despite the scary name, modern vampire squid are docile denizens of the deep sea — but their Jurassic ancestors may have been a lot fiercer.</p>



<p>Analyses of fossilized soft tissue from three 164-million-year-old specimens of <em>Vampyronassa rhodanica</em> suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12269-3">the ancient cephalopods had some powerful weapons</a>, researchers say June 23 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Unlike its blobby modern relative, <em>V. rhodanica</em> had a more streamlined muscular body, with two of its eight arms twice as long as the other six. Strong suckers on all eight arms could have helped it snatch and hold onto prey.</p>





<p>Modern vampire squid (<em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>) are not actually squid; they’re the only surviving members of an ancient, diverse order of cephalopods, the Vampyromorpha. And <em>V. infernalis</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/real-vampire-squid">are pretty passive about finding food</a> (<em>SN: 6/25/12</em>). Alongside their arms, they have two long, retractable, sticky filaments <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.1357">that they use like flypaper</a> to collect ”marine snow,” tiny bits of dead plankton or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-squid-take-mommy-breaks">sinking fecal pellets</a> that happen to drift past (<em>SN: 5/19/15</em>).</p>



<p>Fossilized tissue suggests <em>V. rhodanica</em> had a very different lifestyle, report paleontologist Alison Rowe of Sorbonne University in Paris and her colleagues.</p>

<p>Both the ancient and the modern creatures have eight arms bearing suckers flanked by hairlike cirri. But the ancient cephalopod’s suckers are attached to the arms by stalks embedded in round layers of muscle. That muscular arrangement, the team says, would have greatly increased the pressure differential inside the sucker — making its suction more powerful. The creature’s numerous, closely packed cirri may have helped it sense prey, similar to a strategy used by some modern octopuses.</p>



<p><em>V. infernalis’</em> suckers, lacking that muscle arrangement, don’t have such a strong grip. Instead, its suckers secrete mucus that coats whatever the creatures have captured with their filaments. The cirri then slide that slippery food along the arms and into its mouth.</p>

Anderson.</h6><hr><p>Manhood is precarious. Unlike womanhood, manhood is hard won and easily lost and therefore men go to great effort to perform it—for the most part for other boys and men—sometimes to their own and others’ detriment.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/white-fragility-why-its-so-hard-to-talk-to-white-people-about-racism-twlm/">[63]</a>&nbsp;Men will go out of their way to not appear unmanly or feminine—they adhere to an anti-femininity mandate. For example, men are reluctant to take jobs that women do. Men hold out for diminishing coal-mining jobs when they should be applying for home health aid jobs. Women have been flexible and have pushed themselves into men’s jobs; men have not pushed themselves into women’s jobs.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029826">[64]</a>&nbsp;</p><p>There are consequences of the investment in maintaining manhood for individual men, as well as the rest of us. Men learn to be fixated on performing masculinity which often entails aggression. Men tend to believe that aggression is more typical than it actually is—as we learned earlier. They falsely believe that women are attracted to aggressive men, when, in fact, women tend to view aggression as weak and impulsive, a loss of self-control, and not sexy or charming.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653339162/-man-up-how-a-fear-of-appearing-feminine-restricts-men-and-affects-us-all.">[65]</a>&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>Gun popularity among men is linked to threats to their gender status &#8230; How do we know?

In 2018, Markeis McGlockton, an African American man, pushed a White man to the ground because the man was yelling at his partner outside a convenience store. The man pulled out a gun and shot and killed McGlockton and was not prosecuted because of Florida’s stand-your-ground law.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029826">[66]</a>&nbsp;Stand-your-ground laws and gun ownership are manifestations of feeling entitled to never back down. Gun owners often justify owning or carrying a gun with fears of violent crime however, over the same period in which gun purchases have risen, violent crime has dropped. In truth, support for gun rights for White men is linked to perceived threats to their racial privilege.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/07/21/hes-accused-of-killing-someone-in-a-parking-spot-dispute-authorities-say-he-was-standing-his-ground/?utm_term=.6cd681eb0bf2">[67]</a>&nbsp;Gun popularity among men is linked to threats to their gender status as well.

As we saw above, Jonathan Metzl’s work finds that guns are used by White men as a means of preserving racial privilege, even as Whites wind up being disproportionately harmed by the presence of guns.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12565">[71]</a></p><p>&nbsp;It turns out in laboratory studies it’s pretty easy to threaten men’s masculinity into panic that then motivates them toward compensation. It’s worth taking a second look at a study described in&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197578438.001.0001/oso-9780197578438-chapter-5">Chapter 4</a>&nbsp;where Julia Dahl [72] and her colleagues asked young and mostly White men to complete a “gender knowledge test.” During this test participants were asked questions such as, “What is a dime in football?” and “Do you wear Manolo Blahniks on your head or feet?” The respondents were then randomly put into either a threat condition—being told they scored similar to the average women—or a no-threat condition—being told they scored like the typical man. Their grouping had nothing to do with their actual answers on the test. Men threatened by being associated with women were more likely to feel embarrassed by their responses, angry, and wanted to display dominant behaviors. Anger predicted greater endorsement of ideologies that implicitly promote men’s power over women. Specifically, men’s social dominance orientations and benevolent sexism (and both are correlated with entitlement) increased if they were exposed to the masculine threat. How did the threatened men in this study appease that threat to their masculinity?
