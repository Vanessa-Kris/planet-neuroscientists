              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brown-dwarf-sand-cloud-atmosphere-space">Sand clouds are common in atmospheres of brown dwarfs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clouds of sand can condense, grow and disappear in some extraterrestrial atmospheres. A new look at old data shows that clouds made of hot silicate minerals are common in celestial objects known as brown dwarfs.</p>



<p>“This is the first full contextual understanding of any cloud outside the solar system,” says astronomer Stanimir Metchev of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada. Metchev’s colleague Genaro Suárez presented the new work <a href="https://coolstars21.github.io/">July 4 at the Cool Stars meeting</a> in Toulouse, France.</p>





<p>Clouds come in many flavors in our solar system, from Earth’s puffs of water vapor to Jupiter’s bands of ammonia. Astronomers have also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">inferred the presence of “extrasolar clouds</a>” on planets outside the solar system (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>But the only extrasolar clouds that have been directly detected were in the skies of brown dwarfs — dim, ruddy orbs that are too large to be planets but too small and cool to be stars. In 2004, astronomers used NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope to observe brown dwarfs and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/420707">spotted spectral signatures of sand</a> — more specifically, grains of silicate minerals such as quartz and olivine. A few more <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/505637">tentative examples</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/524726">sand clouds</a> were spotted in 2006 and 2008.</p>



<p>Floating in one of these clouds would feel like being in a sandstorm, says planetary scientist Mark Marley of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was involved in one of those early discoveries. “If you could take a scoop out of it and bring it home, you would have hot sand.”</p>



<p>Astronomers at the time found six examples of these silicate clouds. “I kind of thought that was it,” Marley says. Theoretically, there should be a lot more than six brown dwarfs with sandy skies. But part of the Spitzer telescope ran out of coolant in 2009 and was no longer able to measure similar clouds’ chemistry.</p>



<p>While Suárez was looking into archived Spitzer data for a different project, he realized there were unpublished or unanalyzed data on dozens of brown dwarfs. So he analyzed all of the low-mass stars and brown dwarfs that Spitzer had ever observed, 113 objects in total, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/4/5701/6576783?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">68 of which had never been published before</a>, the team reports in the July <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</em></p>



<p>“It’s very impressive to me that this was hiding in plain sight,” Marley says.</p>



<p>Not every brown dwarf in the sample showed strong signs of silicate clouds. But together, the brown dwarfs followed a clear trend. For dwarfs and low-mass stars hotter than about 1700˚ Celsius, silicates exist as a vapor, and the objects show no signs of clouds. But below that temperature, signs of clouds start to appear, becoming thickest around 1300˚ C. Then the signal disappears for brown dwarfs that are cooler than about 1000˚ C, as the clouds sink deep into the atmospheres.</p>



<p>The finding confirms previous suspicions that silicate clouds are widespread and reveals the conditions under which they form. Because brown dwarfs are born hot and cool down over time, most of them should see each phase of sand cloud evolution as they age. “We are learning how these brown dwarfs live,” Suárez says. Future research can extrapolate the results to better understand atmospheres in planets like Jupiter, he notes.</p>



<p>The recently launched <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will also study atmospheric chemistry in exoplanets and brown dwarfs and will specifically look for clouds (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>). Marley looks forward to combining the trends from this study with future results from JWST. “It’s really going to be a renaissance in brown dwarf science,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pitcher-plant-underground-new-species-carnivorous">This pitcher plant species sets its deathtraps underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Biologist Martin Dančák didn’t set out to find a plant species new to science. But on a hike through a rainforest in Borneo, he and colleagues stumbled on a subterranean surprise.</p>



<p>Hidden beneath the soil and inside dark, mossy pockets below tree roots, carnivorous pitcher plants dangled their deathtraps underground. The pitchers can look like hollow eggplants and probably lure unsuspecting prey into their sewer hole-like traps. Once an ant or a beetle steps in, the insect falls to its death, drowning in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-help-carnivorous-plants-drown-their-prey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a stew of digestive juices</a> (<em>SN: 11/22/16</em>). Until now, scientists had never observed pitcher plants with traps almost exclusively entombed in earth.&nbsp;</p>





<p><em>“</em>We were, of course, astonished as nobody would expect that a pitcher plant with underground traps could exist,” says Dančák, of&nbsp;Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic.</p>



<p>That’s because pitchers tend to be fragile. But the new species’ <a href="https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/82872/">hidden traps have fleshy walls that may help them push against soil</a> as they grow underground, Dančák and colleagues report June 23 in <em>PhytoKeys</em>. Because the buried pitchers stay concealed from sight, the team named the species <em>Nepenthes pudica, </em>a nod to the Latin word for bashful.</p>



<p>The work “highlights how much biodiversity still exists that we haven’t fully discovered,” says Leonora Bittleston, a biologist at Boise State University in Idaho who was not involved with the study. It’s possible that other pitcher plant species may have traps lurking underground and scientists just haven’t noticed yet, she says. “I think a lot of people don’t really dig down.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about a paper &quot;Distinct Lateral Inhibitory Circuits Drive Parallel Processing of Sensory Information in the Mammalian Olfactory Bulb&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Splitting sensory information into parallel pathways is a common strategy in
sensory systems. Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to
maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly
understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral
and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the
emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral
inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral
inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described
differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells.
Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted
cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating
that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may
be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">A supersensitive dark matter search found no signs of the substance — yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next generation of dark matter detectors has arrived.</p>



<p>A massive new effort to detect the elusive substance has reported its first results. Following a time-honored tradition of dark matter hunters, the experiment, called LZ, didn’t find dark matter. But it has done that <a href="https://lz.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/LZ_SR1_Paper_7July2022.pdf">better than ever before</a>, physicists report July 7 in a virtual webinar and a paper posted on LZ’s website. And with several additional years of data-taking planned from LZ and other experiments like it, physicists are hopeful they’ll finally get a glimpse of dark matter.</p>





<p>“Dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in particle physics today,” LZ spokesperson Hugh Lippincott, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara said during the webinar.</p>



<p>LZ, or LUX-ZEPLIN, aims to discover the unidentified particles that are thought to make up most of the universe’s matter. Although no one has ever conclusively detected a particle of dark matter, its influence on the universe can be seen in the motions of stars and galaxies, and via <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks">other cosmic observations</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>Located about 1.5 kilometers underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, S.D., the detector is filled with 10 metric tons of liquid xenon. If dark matter particles crash into the nuclei of any of those xenon atoms, they would produce flashes of light that the detector would pick up.</p>



<p>The LZ experiment is one of a new generation of bigger, badder dark matter detectors based on liquid xenon, which also includes XENONnT in Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy and PandaX-4T in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The experiments aim to detect a theorized type of dark matter called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shadows-two-failed-searches-loom-over-physics">WIMPs</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/16</em>). Scientists scaled up the search to allow for a better chance of spying the particles, with each detector containing multiple tons of liquid xenon.</p>



<p>Using only about 60 days’ worth of data, LZ has already surpassed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-particles-elude-scientists-biggest-search-wimps">earlier efforts</a> to pin down WIMPs (<em>SN: 5/28/18</em>). “It’s really impressive what they’ve been able to pull off; it’s a technological marvel,” says theoretical physicist Dan Hooper of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Although LZ’s search came up empty, “the way something’s going to be discovered is when you have multiple years in a row of running,” says LZ collaborator Matthew Szydagis, a physicist at the University at Albany in New York. LZ is expected to run for about five years, and data from that extended period may provide physicists’ best chance to find the particles.</p>



<p>Now that the detector has proven its potential, says LZ physicist Kevin Lesko of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, “we’re excited about what we’re going to see.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-short-arms-tyrannosaurus-rex-meraxes-gigas-paleontology">A newfound dinosaur had tiny arms before T. rex made them cool</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>’s tiny arms have launched a thousand <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/928881-t-rex-s-short-arms">sarcastic memes</a>: I love you <em>this</em> much; can you pass the salt?; row, row, row your … oh.</p>



<p>But back off, snarky jokesters. A newfound species of big-headed carnivorous dinosaur with tiny forelimbs suggests those arms weren’t just an evolutionary punchline. Arm reduction — alongside giant heads — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.05.057">evolved independently in different dinosaur lineages</a>, researchers report July 7 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p><em>Meraxes gigas</em>, named for a dragon in George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, lived between 100 million and 90 million years ago in what’s now Argentina, says Juan Canale, a paleontologist with the country’s CONICET research network who is based in Buenos Aires. Despite the resemblance to <em>T. rex</em>, <em>M. gigas</em> wasn’t a tyrannosaur; it was a carcharodontosaur — a member of a distantly related, lesser-known group of predatory theropod dinosaurs. <em>M. gigas</em> went extinct nearly 20 million years before <em>T. rex</em> walked on Earth.</p>





<p>The <em>M. gigas</em> individual described by Canale and colleagues was about 45 years old and weighed more than four metric tons when it died, they estimate. The fossilized specimen is about 11 meters long, and its skull is heavily ornamented with crests and bumps and tiny hornlets, ornamentations that probably helped attract mates.</p>



<p>Why these dinosaurs had such tiny arms is an enduring mystery. They weren’t for hunting: Both <em>T. rex</em> and <em>M. gigas</em> used their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tyrannosaurus-rex-pulverized-bones-incredible-amount-force">massive heads to hunt prey</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/18</em>). The arms may have shrunk <a href="https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app67/app009212021.pdf">so they were out of the way</a> during the frenzy of group feeding on carcasses.</p>



<p>But, Canale says, <em>M. gigas’</em> arms were surprisingly muscular, suggesting they were more than just an inconvenient limb. One possibility is that the arms helped lift the animal from a reclining to a standing position. Another is that they aided in mating — perhaps showing a mate some love.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-college-campus-coronavirus-deaths-communities">College COVID-19 testing can reduce coronavirus deaths in local communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Getting a COVID-19 test has become a regular part of many college students’ lives. That ritual may protect not just those students’ classmates and professors but also their municipal bus drivers, neighbors and other members of the local community, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Counties where colleges and universities did COVID-19 testing saw <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000065#pdig.0000065.s001">fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths</a> than ones with schools that did not do any testing in the fall of 2020, researchers report June 23 in <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>. While previous analyses have shown that counties with colleges that brought students back to campus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">had more COVID-19 cases</a> than those that continued online instruction, this is the first look at the impact of campus testing on those communities on a national scale (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>).</p>

<p>“It’s tough to think of universities as just silos within cities; it’s just much more permeable than that,” says Brennan Klein, a network scientist at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>



<p>Colleges that tested their students generally did not see significantly lower case counts than schools that didn’t do testing, Klein and his colleagues found. But the communities surrounding these schools did see fewer cases and deaths. That’s because towns with colleges conducting regular testing had a more accurate sense of how much COVID-19 was circulating in their communities, Klein says, which allowed those towns to understand the risk level and put masking policies and other mitigation strategies in place.</p>



<p>The results highlight the crucial role testing can continue to play as students return to campus this fall, says Sam Scarpino, vice president of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute in Washington, D.C. Testing “may not be optional in the fall if we want to keep colleges and universities open safely,” he says.</p>





<h4>Finding a flight path</h4>



<p>As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world in the spring of 2020, it had a swift impact on U.S. college students. Most were abruptly sent home from their dorm rooms, lecture halls, study abroad programs and even spring break outings to spend what would be the remainder of the semester online. And with the start of the fall semester just months away, schools were “flying blind” as to how to bring students back to campus safely, Klein says.</p>



<p>That fall, Klein, Scarpino and their collaborators began to put together a potential flight path for schools by collecting data from COVID-19 dashboards created by universities and the counties surrounding those schools to track cases. The researchers classified schools based on whether they had opted for entirely online learning or in-person teaching. They then divided the schools with in-person learning based on whether they did any testing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a perfect comparison, Klein says, because this method groups schools that did one round of testing with those that did consistent surveillance testing. But the team’s analyses still generally show how colleges’ pandemic response impacted their local communities.</p>



<p>Overall, counties with colleges saw more cases and deaths than counties without schools. However, testing helped minimize the increase in cases and deaths. During the fall semester, from August to December, counties with colleges that did testing saw on average 14 fewer deaths per 100,000 people than counties with colleges that brought students back with no testing — 56 deaths per 100,000 versus about 70.</p>

<h3>College testing advantage</h3>



<p>During the fall of 2020, the first semester colleges and universities brought students back to campus during the pandemic, counties with schools that did COVID-19 testing had a lower death rate on average (red line) than schools that did not do testing (yellow line), a new data analysis shows. Counties with campus testing experienced 56 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents; that average rose to about 70 per 100,000 in counties without any testing. In comparison, the national death rate (black line) for that time period was about 59 deaths per 100,000 but often tracked a little lower than that of college counties, researchers found.</p>

<p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst, with nearly 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students in 2020, is one case study of the value of the testing, Klein says. Throughout the fall semester, the school <a href="https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/news/update-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-program">tested students twice a week</a>. That meant that three times as many tests occurred in the city of Amherst than in neighboring cities, he says. For much of the fall and winter, Amherst had fewer COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents than its neighboring counties and statewide averages.</p>



<p>Once students left for winter break, campus testing stopped – so overall local testing dropped. When students returned for spring semester in February 2021, area cases spiked — possibly driven by students bringing the coronavirus back from their travels and by being exposed to local residents whose cases may have been missed due to the drop in local testing. Students returned “to a town that has more COVID than they realize” Klein says.</p>



<p>Renewed campus testing not only picked up the spike but quickly prompted mitigation strategies. The university moved classes to Zoom and asked students to remain in their rooms, at one point even telling them that they <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/amid-covid-outbreak-umass-amherst-prohibits-students-from-leaving-dorms-for-walks/2299189/">should not go on walks outdoors</a>. By mid-March, the university reduced the spread of cases on campus and the town once again had a lower COVID-19 case rate than its neighbors for the remainder of the semester, the team found.</p>



<h4>The value of testing</h4>



<p>It’s helpful to know that testing overall helped protect local communities, says David Paltiel, a public health researcher at the Yale School of Public Health who was not involved with the study. Paltiel was one of the first researchers to call for <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768923">routine testing on college campuses</a>, regardless of whether students had symptoms.</p>



<p>“I believe that testing and masking and all those things probably were really useful, because in the fall of 2020 we didn&#8217;t have a vaccine yet,” he says. Quickly identifying cases and isolating affected students, he adds, was key at the time.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>But each school is unique, he says, and the benefit of testing probably varied between schools. And today, two and a half years into the pandemic, the cost-benefit calculation is different now that vaccines are widely available and schools are faced with newer variants of SARS-CoV-2. Some of those variants spread so quickly that even testing twice a week may not catch all cases on campus quickly enough to stop their spread, he says.</p>



<p>As colleges and universities prepare for the fall 2022 semester, he would recommend schools consider testing students as they return to campus with less frequent follow-up surveillance testing to “make sure things aren’t spinning crazy out of control.”</p>



<p>Still, the study shows that regular campus testing can benefit the broader community, Scarpino says. In fact, he hopes to capitalize on the interest in testing for COVID-19 to roll out more expansive public health testing for multiple respiratory viruses, including the flu, in places like college campuses. In addition to PCR tests — the kind that involve sticking a swab up your nose — such efforts might also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">analyze wastewater</a> and air within buildings for pathogens (<em>SN: 05/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Unchecked coronavirus transmission continues to disrupt lives — in the United States and globally — and new variants will continue to emerge, he says. “We need to be prepared for another surge of SARS-CoV-2 in the fall when the schools reopen, and we&#8217;re back in respiratory season.”</p>

<h2><span class="caps">CNS</span>*2022 Satellite tutorials: recap<a class="headerlink" href="#cns-2022-satellite-tutorials-recap" title="Permalink to this headline">⋆</a></h2>
<p>The primary agenda for the meeting was to discuss the software working group satellite&nbsp;tutorials.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>there were 256 registrants in&nbsp;total</li>
<li>for each session, more than 85 people had indicated that they would attend, but average turn out was at about 10&#8212;20 for each&nbsp;session</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed ideas for the next round of satellite tutorials to increase turn&nbsp;out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we could send out daily reminders with links during the tutorial days<ul>
<li>per session e-mails could also be sent out, but would be too much work to do manually (and error&nbsp;prone)</li>
<li>needs to be automated in a way that e-mails don&#8217;t end up in spam: can be scripted using tool such as <a class="reference external" href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/python-mail-merge/">mailmerge</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>also generate and attach an <span class="caps">ICS</span> calendar file to e-mails so attendees can add to their&nbsp;calendars</li>
<li>we could require additional confirmation/cancellation before starting; this will give us better idea of who will attend, but won&#8217;t necessarily increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
<li>we could have a low registration fee: this will filter out people who &#8220;just sign up&#8221;, but may not increase actual attendance<ul>
<li>could include registration waivers for&nbsp;students</li>
<li>could make it free for <span class="caps">INCF</span>/<span class="caps">OCNS</span> members: encourage&nbsp;memberships</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>people may not have known enough about tools to know what sessions to attend<ul>
<li>we could have a starting keynote on introduction to comp neuro, and then it gives attendees an idea of what is going to be featured during the tutorials<ul>
<li>it&#8217;ll be good to get a high profile speaker who would be happy to do this to increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>see also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/61">https://github.com/<span class="caps">OCNS</span>/SoftwareWG/issues/61</a></li>
<li>we could also have a recording with a few minutes about each tool that&#8217;s featured in the satellite tutorials: teaser type video; so that people can watch a quick YouTube video and get an idea of all&nbsp;tutorials</li>
<li>we could also have a set of slides based on a template showing the features of each&nbsp;tool</li>
<li>these last few ideas require some extra work from participating&nbsp;tutors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spreading the sessions over weeks instead of days in a week may not necessarily increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
<li><span class="caps">ACTION</span>: Ankur create and send out feedback survey to registrants to gather information on what went well and why people were not able to attend; it&#8217;s important to understand if it was because people missed sessions because the information/calendar wasn&#8217;t clearly accessible so that we can improve on&nbsp;these</li>
<li>does it make sense to do it <em>after</em> the conferences to build on the momentum of the conference: can be done, the next ones in ~6 months time will be independent of the&nbsp;conference</li>
<li>we must push both <span class="caps">INCF</span> and <span class="caps">OCNS</span> to send out communications about the&nbsp;sessions</li>
<li>we may repeat this again in 6 months, with improvements: &#8220;Simulator week&#8221;?<ul>
<li>Depends on how many software <span class="caps">WG</span> folks can commit to spending time on helping with&nbsp;organisation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="caps">ACTION</span>: Ankur e-mail all tutors with our discussion and improvements for the next iteration, asking if they&#8217;d be happy to re-do sessions if we repeat in 6&nbsp;months.</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-stupa-tower-india-drinking-water-irrigation">How to build better ice towers for drinking water and irrigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a better way to build a glacier.</p>



<p>During winter in India’s mountainous Ladakh region, some farmers use pipes and sprinklers to construct building-sized cones of ice. These towering, humanmade glaciers, called ice stupas, slowly release water as they melt during the dry spring months for communities to drink or irrigate crops. But the pipes often freeze when conditions get too cold, stifling construction.</p>



<p>Now, preliminary results show that <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/hydrology22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1027738">an automated system</a> can erect an ice stupa while avoiding frozen pipes, using local weather data to control when and how much water is spouted. What’s more, the new system uses roughly a tenth the amount of water that the conventional method uses, researchers reported June 23 at the Frontiers in Hydrology meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>





<p>“This is one of the technological steps forward that we need to get this innovative idea to the point where it&#8217;s realistic as a solution,” says glaciologist Duncan Quincey of the University of Leeds in England who was not involved in the research. Automation could help communities build larger, longer-lasting ice stupas that provide more water during dry periods, he says.</p>



<p>Ice stupas emerged in 2014 as a means for communities to cope with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/himalayan-glacier-melting-threatens-water-security-millions-people">shrinking alpine glaciers</a> due to human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 5/29/19</em>). Typically, high-mountain communities in India, Kyrgyzstan and Chile pipe glacial meltwater into gravity-driven fountains that sprinkle continuously in the winter. Cold air freezes the drizzle, creating frozen cones that can store millions of liters of water.</p>



<p>The process is simple, though inefficient. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.771342/full">More than 70 percent</a> of the spouted water may flow away instead of freezing, says glaciologist Suryanarayanan Balasubramanian of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.</p>



<p>So Balasubramanian and his team outfitted an ice stupa’s fountain with a computer that automatically adjusted the spout’s flow rate based on local temperatures, humidity and wind speed. Then the scientists tested the system by building two ice stupas in Guttannen, Switzerland — one using a continuously spraying fountain and one using the automated system.</p>



<p>After four months, the team found that the continuously sprinkling fountain had spouted about 1,100 cubic meters of water and amassed 53 cubic meters of ice, with pipes freezing once. The automated system sprayed only around 150 cubic meters of water but formed 61 cubic meters of ice, without any frozen pipes.</p>



<p>The researchers are now trying to simplify their prototype to make it more affordable for high-mountain communities around the world. “We eventually want to reduce the cost so that it is within two months of salary of the farmers in Ladakh,” Balasubramanian says. “Around $200 to $400.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593133231">An Immense World</a><br><em>Ed Yong<br>Random House, $30</em></p>



<p>Emerald jewel wasps know what cockroach brains feel like.</p>



<p>This comes in handy when a female wasp needs to turn a cockroach into an obedient zombie that will host her larvae and serve as dinner. First, the wasp plunges its stinger into the cock­roach’s midsection to briefly paralyze the legs. Next comes a more delicate operation: stinging the head to deliver a dose of venom to specific nerve cells in the brain, which gives the wasp control over where its victim goes. But how does a wasp know when it’s reached the brain? The stinger’s tip is a sensory probe. In experiments using brainless cockroaches, a wasp will sting the head over and over again, searching fruitlessly for its desired target.</p>





<p>A brain-feeling stinger is just one example of the myriad ways animals sense the world around them. We humans tend to think the world is as we perceive it. But for everything that we can see, smell, taste, hear or touch, there’s so much more that we’re oblivious to.</p>



<p>In <em>An Immense World</em>, science journalist Ed Yong introduces that hidden world and the concept of <em>Umwelt</em>, a German word that refers to the parts of the environment an animal senses and experiences. Every creature has its own <em>Umwelt</em>. In a room filled with different types of organisms, or even multiple people, each individual would experience that shared atmo­sphere in wholly different ways.</p>



<p>Yong eases readers into the truly immense world of senses by starting with ones that we are intimately familiar with. In some cases, he tests the limits of his own abilities. Dog noses, for instance, are better than human noses at sniffing out a scent long after the source is gone, as Yong demonstrates. While crawling around on his hands and knees with his eyes closed, he was able to track a chocolate-scented string that a researcher had put on the ground. But he lost the scent when the string was removed. That wouldn’t happen to a dog. It would pick up the trace, string or no string.</p>





<p>In exploring the vast sensory world, it helps to have a good imagination, as even familiar senses can seem quite strange. Scallops, for instance, have eyes and somehow “see” despite having a crude brain that can’t process the images. Crickets have hairs that are so responsive to an approaching spider that trying to make the hairs more sensitive might break the rules of physics. A blind Ecuadorian catfish senses raging water with durable teeth that cover its skin. The animal uses the dentures to find calmer waters.</p>



<p>Going through these imagination warm-up exercises makes it somewhat easier to ponder what it might be like to be an echolocating bat, a bird that detects magnetic fields or a fish that communicates using electricity. Yong’s vivid descriptions also help readers fathom these senses: “A river full of electric fish must be like a cocktail party where no one <em>ever </em>shuts up, even when their mouths are full.” In a forest, foliage may seem largely silent, but some insects “talk” through plant stems using vibration. With headphones hooked up to plants so that scientists can listen in, “chirping cicadas sound like cows and katydids sound like revving chainsaws.”</p>



<p>For all the book’s wonder, the last chapter brings readers crashing back to today’s reality. Humans are polluting animals’ <em>Umwelten</em>; we’re forcing animals to exist in environments con­taminated with human-made stimuli. And the consequences can be deadly, Yong warns. Adding artificial light in the dark­ness of night is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">killing birds and insects</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peace-and-quiet-becoming-more-elusive-us-wild-areas">Making environments louder</a> is masking the sounds of preda­tors and forcing prey to spend more time keeping an eye out than eating (<em>SN: 5/4/17</em>). “We are closer than ever to understanding what it is like to be another animal,” Yong writes, “but we have made it harder than ever for other animals to be.” </p>



<p>Since each of us has our own <em>Umwelt</em>, fully understand­ing the foreign worlds of animals is close to impossible, Yong writes. How do we know, for instance, which animals feel pain? Researchers can dissect the signals or stimuli an ani­mal might receive. But what that creature experiences often remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trauma-ptsd-growth-myth-cultural-narrative-mental-health">The idea that many people grow following trauma may be a myth</a></h4>

              
                <p>“What does not kill me, makes me stronger,” 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously wrote. Variations of that aphorism abound in literary, spiritual and, more recently, psychological texts.</p>



<p>That psychological research suggests that at least half of survivors not only recover from traumatic experiences but also go on to develop more appreciation for life, stronger relationships and emotional strength — a phenomenon researchers call “posttraumatic growth.”</p>



<p>The idea that bad events can often lead to good outcomes is appealing, especially in this present and difficult moment. More than 6.3 million people worldwide have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">died from COVID-19</a>, and deaths continue to mount (<em>SN: 5/18/22</em>). Russia’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">invasion of Ukraine</a> has surpassed a hundred days (<em>SN 4/12/22</em>). And a recent string of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-violence-mass-shootings-increase-united-states-data-uvalde-buffalo">mass shootings</a> — including at a July 4 parade in Highland Park, Ill., an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. — has left U.S. communities reeling (<em>SN: 5/26/22</em>).</p>





<p>But in a <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Program_Book_APS_2022-Online.pdf">series of talks</a> presented in May in Chicago at the Association for Psychological Science conference, some researchers called findings of posttraumatic growth “largely illusory.” Growth studies suffer from serious methodological flaws, these researchers say. That includes a reliance on surveys that require people to assess their personal growth over time, a task that most people struggle with.</p>



<p>Better research tools may not remedy the problem. That’s because these studies are fundamentally flawed, the researchers say. They argue that the impetus to study trauma in terms of growth stems from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/december-7-2019">Western mind-set</a> that tends to value positive emotions and devalue or even avoid negative emotions (<em>SN: 12/7/19</em>). That can pressure survivors to deny or suppress their negative feelings, which could have harmful consequences.</p>



<p>That yearning for positive outcomes can create “toxic cultural narratives,” says personality psychologist Eranda Jayawickreme of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Referring to parents who lost a child in the Uvalde mass shooting, he says: “There is something grotesque about this expectation that people could come back from something like this.”</p>



<h4>Focusing on the good</h4>



<p>A half-century ago, psychologists largely treated a person’s difficulty in rebounding from traumatic events as a personal failing. But research on returning Vietnam War veterans and other trauma survivors began shifting that way of thinking. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association created a category for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-survivors-ptsd-mental-health">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, or PTSD, in its manual of mental disorders. Those struggling with the disorder might experience flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety.</p>



<p>“Thirty years ago, everyone was focused on the worst outcomes,” says trauma and resilience expert George Bonanno of Columbia University.</p>



<p>But only about one-fifth of people who experience trauma develop PTSD, psychologists realized. In the mid-1990s, psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun, both then at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, wrote in the 1996 <em>Journal of Traumatic Stress </em>that a focus on suffering obscured the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490090305">good that can emerge from trauma</a><em>.</em></p>



<p>The pair developed a now widely used “growth inventory” to assess positive outcomes that people reported after experiencing a traumatic event. In the 21-item survey, respondents rate statements such as “I have more compassion for others” and “I established a new path for my life.” Respondents can choose from a score of 0 for “I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis” to 5 for “I experienced this change to a very great degree as a result of my crisis.”&nbsp; The items reflect five broad categories: relating to others, personal strength, new possibilities, appreciation of life and spiritual change. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Posttraumatic growth is you go down to the depths and then at some later point, rise above that baseline into some other realm,” says Tedeschi, now the chair of Boulder Crest Institute for Posttraumatic Growth, an organization in Bluemont, Va., that uses research on posttraumatic growth to help combat veterans, first responders and their families.</p>



<h4>Cracks in the theory</h4>



<p>But some researchers soon began to question people’s ability to accurately respond to the growth survey.</p>



<p>In a now-seminal 2009 study in <em>Psychological Science, </em>researchers recruited about 1,500 undergraduate students and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02381.x">tracked them for eight weeks</a>. Once at the start of the study and once at the end, students responded to surveys for each of the five growth categories covered by the growth inventory, along with a modified version of the inventory.</p>



<p>Unlike Tedeschi and Calhoun’s inventory, which asks respondents to compare their present state of mind to the past, the five surveys and modified inventory asked respondents to reflect on the present. For instance, in the relationship quality category, respondents rated the statement: “I enjoy personal and mutual conversations with family members or friends.”</p>



<p>During that eight-week period, 122 students reported experiencing a traumatic event that caused high levels of distress. Those students also completed the standard growth inventory at the end of the eight weeks. The researchers found no correlation between high perceived growth scores on the standard inventory and actual growth scores on the modified inventory and five surveys related to well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That mismatch occurs because people are terrible at remembering how they felt in the past, says study coauthor Crystal Park, a clinical health psychologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. “I want to throw out the concept of people being able to accurately report that they have grown.”</p>



<p>Tedeschi counters that trauma cleaves one’s life into a before and after, making it more feasible for many people to distinguish changes over time. What’s more, growth takes time, he says. “You can’t expect people to change their spiritual beliefs in eight weeks.”</p>



<p>But how much time? And if enough time passes, how does one know that the growth arises from the trauma and not some other major life experience, like moving across the country or having children? Research shows that people are not great at introspection, Jayawickreme says. “We tend to come up with all types of stories for change, but those stories are just stories. They don’t really reflect what actually caused that change.”</p>



<h4>‘Pulling for growth’</h4>



<p>Other problems come with the design of the original inventory, Jayawickreme and others argue. For example, the questions account for positive changes only, and the worst or lowest outcome a respondent can give is that they experienced no change as a result of their crisis. That framing puts pressure on survivors to report growth when they may feel worse, Jayawickreme says. “The items are pulling for growth.”</p>



<p>Tedeschi and colleagues have recently developed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304116#ec0005">a new growth survey</a> that also accounts for negative changes following trauma. But it’s not yet as widely used in research on posttraumatic growth as the original.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in unpublished work, trauma researcher Adriel Boals of the University of North Texas in Denton sought to overcome what he sees as the original survey’s growth bias in a different way. He asked people whether they changed <em>because </em>of a traumatic event, a measure of growth, or <em>despite</em> the event.</p>



<p>“Half the people are picking, ‘I changed despite this event,’” Boals says. That suggests that people who may report growth on the original inventory do not actually attribute that growth to the trauma but to other life experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, say Jayawickreme and others, unlike most psychological surveys, which require respondents to complete a single cognitive task along the lines of “how are you doing now” or “reflect on the present,” the original growth inventory requires four cognitive tasks. Respondents must consider how they are doing at the moment and how they were doing prior to the trauma. They then must compute that difference in well-being, as well as determine if the trauma, or some other life event such as aging or having a child, caused the change.</p>



<p>But people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615806.2022.2047949?journalCode=gasc20">don’t actually go through those steps</a>. That finding was reported in March in <em>Anxiety, Stress and Coping</em> and at the May conference by Boals, Park and Elizabeth Griffith, a psychologist also at the University of North Texas.</p>



<p>When the team compared response times among college students taking the standard growth inventory with students taking a simplified version involving a single cognitive task, the researchers found that the students completing the standard inventory took just 8 percent longer than the other students. That equates to just a half-second longer response time per item, Boals says. “If you can go through steps 2, 3 and 4 … in half a second, you’re drinking stronger coffee than I am.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Avoiding negative emotions</h4>



<p>Beyond the methodological particulars, some researchers studying trauma across cultures question some Western psychologists’ focus on personal growth and, to a lesser degree, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/kids-will-be-all-right">resilience</a> — a phenomenon marked by stability during hard times, rather than a steep increase in well-being after an initial decline as observed in posttraumatic growth (<em>SN: 10/19/14</em>).</p>



<p>“In Euro-American societies, ‘resilience’ and ‘posttraumatic growth’ are commonly used metaphorical terms for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363461519844355?journalCode=tpse">positive responses to extreme adversity</a>,” write University of Zurich psychologists Iara Meili and Andreas Maercker in 2019 in <em>Transcultural Psychiatry. </em>They attribute the popularity of these Western “metaphors” to individualistic societies’ emphasis on self-determination and agency, even in the face of illness or death. These concepts exist elsewhere, Maercker says. But they rarely take on such outsize significance — what he calls “almost a religious approach.”</p>



<p>A societal expectation of growth can put tremendous pressure on survivors to hide their suffering, Jayawickreme says.</p>



<p>Take, for instance, a study where researchers compared outcomes among about 380 Norwegian soldiers who deployed to Iraq in 2004. Soldiers who reported the most personal growth five months after returning home <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702614549800">also reported the most posttraumatic stress symptoms 10 months later</a>, researchers noted in 2015 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>.</p>



<p>“Self-reports of posttraumatic growth should be highly correlated with doing well on other measurements, like less depression, more satisfaction with life, those types of things,” says Boals, who was not involved with this research. “But if anything, [growth] is positively correlated with PTSD symptoms.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, the most compassionate response to suffering is to validate survivors’ feelings, Jayawickreme says. “How people respond to adversity is nuanced. People can change in positive ways. People can change in negative ways. People cannot change at all. And that’s fine.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-anemone-venomous-stinger-launch-prey">Here’s how sea anemones launch their venomous stingers</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the starlet sea anemone’s stinger gets right to the point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Live-animal images and 3-D computer reconstructions have revealed the complex architecture of the tiny creature’s needlelike weapons.&nbsp;Like a harpoon festooned with venomous barbs, the stinger <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31090-0">rapidly transforms as it fires</a>, biologists Matt Gibson, Ahmet Karabulut and colleagues report June 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists can now see in exquisite detail “what this apparatus looks like before, during and&nbsp;after firing,” says Gibson, of the&nbsp;Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo.</p>





<p>In the wild, the starlet sea anemone (<em>Nematostella vectensis</em>) can live in salty lagoons or shallow estuaries, where freshwater rivers meet the sea. Its tubular body burrows into the mud, and a crown of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-sea-anemone-grows-its-tentacles">Medusa-like tentacles</a> reaches up into the water, waiting for dinner to drift by (<em>SN: 5/7/13</em>). Each tentacle is packing heat: hundreds of stingers that can mean death for brine shrimp or free-floating plankton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These stingers are among the fastest micromachines in nature. An anemone can jab a predator or nab some lunch in about a hundredth of a second, says Karabulut, also of the Stowers Institute. Scientists had an idea of how such stingers worked, but until now, had never gotten so up close and personal.</p>



<p>The researchers used fluorescent dye to see the stingers in action and scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct their three-dimensional structure. The work reveals the precise, step-by-step mechanics of the speedy shooters.</p>

<p>Packed inside a stinger’s capsule, a venomous thread coils around a central shaft.

Finally, the thread races up through the shaft, sending its barbs into an animal’s soft tissue.</p>



<p>Each stinger is good for just one shot. “It’s a one-hit wonder,” Karabulut says. “Once <em>Nematostella</em> uses it, it’s gone.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">Aliens could send quantum messages to Earth, calculations suggest</a></h4>

              
                <p>An intelligent alien civilization could beam quantum messages to Earth.</p>



<p>Particles of light, or photons, could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.123033">be transmitted over vast, interstellar distances</a> without losing their quantum nature, researchers report June 28 in <em>Physical Review D</em>. That means scientists searching for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-say-time-start-taking-search-aliens-seriously">extraterrestrial signals</a> could also look for quantum messages (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists are currently developing Earth-based <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-satellite-shatters-entanglement-record">quantum communication</a>, a technology that uses quantum particles to send information and has the potential to be more secure than standard, or classical, communication (<em>SN: 6/15/17</em>). Intelligent extraterrestrials, if they’re out there, may have also adopted quantum communication, says theoretical physicist Arjun Berera.</p>





<p>A major obstacle to quantum communication is decoherence, in which a quantum particle loses its quantumness as it interacts with its surroundings. “Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there’s any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,” Berera says.</p>



<p>Since the average density of matter in space is much less than on Earth, particles could be expected to travel farther before succumbing to decoherence. So Berera and theoretical physicist Jaime Calderón Figueroa, both of the University of Edinburgh, calculated how far light — in particular, X-rays — could travel unscathed through interstellar space.</p>



<p>X-ray photons could more than traverse the Milky Way, potentially traveling hundreds of thousands of light-years or even more, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Based on the findings, Berera and Calderón Figueroa considered strategies to search for E.T.’s quantum dispatches.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diet-food-dementia-alzheimers-disease-research">How scientists are shifting their search for links between diet and dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The internet is rife with advice for keeping the brain sharp as we age, and much of it is focused on the foods we eat. Headlines promise that oatmeal will fight off dementia. Blueberries improve memory. Coffee can slash your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Take fish oil. Eat more fiber. Drink red wine. Forgo alcohol. Snack on nuts. Don’t skip breakfast. But definitely don’t eat bacon.</p>



<p>One recent diet study got media attention, with one headline claiming, “<a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20211111/many-people-may-be-eating-their-way-to-dementia">Many people may be eating their way to dementia</a>.” The study, published last December in <em>Neurology</em>, found that people who ate a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, beans and tea or coffee <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/97/24/e2381">had a lower risk of dementia</a> than those who ate foods that boost inflammation, such as sugar, processed foods, unhealthy fats and red meat.</p>





<p>But the study, like most research on diet and dementia, couldn’t prove a causal link. And that’s not good enough to make recommendations that people should follow. Why has it proved such a challenge to pin down whether the foods we eat can help stave off dementia?</p>



<p>First, dementia, like most chronic diseases, is the result of a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment that researchers don’t fully understand. Diet is just one factor. Second, nutrition research is messy. People struggle to recall the foods they’ve eaten, their diets change over time, and modifying what people eat — even as part of a research study — is exceptionally difficult.</p>



<p>For decades, researchers devoted little effort to trying to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia because they thought there was no way to change the trajectory of these diseases. Dementia seemed to be the result of aging and an unlucky roll of the genetic dice.</p>



<p>While scientists have identified genetic variants that boost risk for dementia, researchers now know that people can cut their risk by adopting a healthier lifestyle: avoiding smoking, keeping weight and blood sugar in check, exercising, managing blood pressure and avoiding too much alcohol — the same healthy behaviors that lower the risk of many chronic diseases.</p>



<p>Diet is wrapped up in several of those healthy behaviors, and many studies suggest that diet may also directly play a role. But what makes for a brain-healthy diet? That’s where the research gets muddled.</p>



<p>Despite loads of studies aimed at dissecting the influence of nutrition on dementia, researchers can’t say much with certainty. “I don’t think there’s any question that diet influences dementia risk or a variety of other age-related diseases,” says Matt Kaeberlein, who studies aging at the University of Washington in Seattle. But “are there specific components of diet or specific nutritional strategies that are causal in that connection?” He doubts it will be that simple.</p>



<h4>Worth trying</h4>



<p>In the United States, an estimated 6.5 million people, the vast majority of whom are over age 65, are living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Experts expect that by 2060, as the senior population grows, nearly 14 million residents over age 65 will have Alzheimer’s disease. Despite decades of research and more than 100 drug trials, scientists have yet to find a treatment for dementia that does more than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-fda-approved-controversy-aducanumab">curb symptoms temporarily</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 8</em>). “Really what we need to do is try and prevent it,” says Maria Fiatarone Singh, a geriatrician at the University of Sydney.</p>



<p>Forty percent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by modifying a dozen risk factors, according to a 2020 report commissioned by the <em>Lancet</em>. The report doesn’t explicitly call out diet, but some researchers think it plays an important role. After years of fixating on specific foods and dietary components — things like fish oil and vitamin E supplements — many researchers in the field have started looking at dietary patterns.</p>



<p>That shift makes sense. “We do not have vitamin E for breakfast, vitamin C for lunch. We eat foods in combination,” says Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and Columbia University. He led the study on dementia and anti-inflammatory diets published in <em>Neurology</em>. But a shift from supplements to a whole diet of myriad foods complicates the research. A once-daily pill is easier to swallow than a new, healthier way of eating.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where diet fits&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Up to 40 percent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by modifying 12 risk factors. Targeting some of these risks reduces nerve cell loss in the brain; other interventions protect the brain’s ability to function and adapt even if some nerve loss has occurred, a concept called cognitive reserve. Diet plays a role in at least four of these risk factors. </p>

<h4>Earning points</h4>



<p>Suspecting that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486891/">inflammation plays a role in dementia</a>, many researchers posit that an anti-inflammatory diet might benefit the brain. In Scarmeas’ study, more than 1,000 older adults in Greece completed a food frequency questionnaire and earned a score based on how “inflammatory” their diet was. The lower the score, the better. For example, fatty fish, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, was considered an anti-inflammatory food and earned negative points. Cheese and many other dairy products, high in saturated fat, earned positive points.</p>



<p>During the next three years, 62 people, or 6 percent of the study participants, developed dementia. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759053/">People with the highest dietary inflammation scores were three times as likely to develop dementia</a> as those with the lowest. Scores ranged from –5.83 to 6.01. Each point increase was linked to a 21 percent rise in dementia risk.</p>



<p>Such epidemiological studies make connections, but they can’t prove cause and effect. Perhaps people who eat the most anti-inflammatory diets also are those least likely to develop dementia for some other reason. Maybe they have more social interactions. Or it could be, Scarmeas says, that people who eat more inflammatory diets do so because they’re already experiencing changes in their brain that lead them to consume these foods and “what we really see is the reverse causality.”</p>



<p>To sort all this out, researchers rely on randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for providing proof of a causal effect. But in the arena of diet and dementia, these studies have challenges.</p>



<p>Dementia is a disease of aging that takes decades to play out, Kaeberlein says. To show that a particular diet could reduce the risk of dementia, “it would take two-, three-, four-decade studies, which just aren’t feasible.” Many clinical trials last less than two years.</p>



<p>As a work-around, researchers often rely on some intermediate outcome, like changes in cognition. But even that can be hard to observe. “If you’re already relatively healthy and don’t have many risks, you might not show much difference, especially if the duration of the study is relatively short,” says Sue Radd-Vagenas, a nutrition scientist at the University of Sydney. “The thinking is if you’re older and you have more risk factors, it’s more likely we might see something in a short period of time.” Yet older adults might already have some cognitive decline, so it might be more difficult to see an effect.</p>



<p>Many researchers now suspect that intervening earlier will have a bigger impact. “We now know that the brain is stressed from midlife and there’s a tipping point at 65 when things go sour,” says Hussein Yassine, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But intervene too early, and a trial might not show any effect. Offering a healthier diet to a 50- or 60-year-old might pay off in the long run but fail to make a difference in cognition that can be measured during the relatively short length of a study.</p>



<p>And it’s not only the timing of the intervention that matters, but also the duration. Do you have to eat a particular diet for two decades for it to have an impact? “We’ve got a problem of timescale,” says Kaarin Anstey, a dementia researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.</p>



<p>And then there are all the complexities that come with studying diet. “You can’t isolate it in the way you can isolate some of the other factors,” Anstey says. “It’s something that you’re exposed to all the time and over decades.”</p>



<h4>Food as medicine?</h4>



<p>In a clinical trial, researchers often test the effectiveness of a drug by offering half the study participants the medication and half a placebo pill. But when the treatment being tested is food, studies become much more difficult to control. First, food doesn’t come in a pill, so it’s tricky to hide whether participants are in the intervention group or the control group.</p>



<p>Imagine a trial designed to test whether the Mediterranean diet can help slow cognitive decline. The participants aren’t told which group they’re in, but the control group sees that they aren’t getting nuts or fish or olive oil. “What ends up happening is a lot of participants will start actively increasing the consumption of the Mediterranean diet despite being on the control arm, because that’s why they signed up,” Yassine says. “So at the end of the trial, the two groups are not very dissimilar.”</p>



<p>Second, we all need food to live, so a true placebo is out of the question. But what diet should the control group consume? Do you compare the diet intervention to people’s typical diets (which may differ from person to person and country to country)? Do you ask the comparison group to eat a healthy diet but avoid the food expected to provide brain benefits? (Offering them an unhealthy diet would be unethical.)</p>



<p>And tracking what people eat during a clinical trial can be a challenge. Many of these studies rely on food frequency questionnaires to tally up all the foods in an individual’s diet. An ongoing study is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480203/">assessing the impact of the MIND diet</a> (which combines part of the Mediterranean diet with elements of the low-salt DASH diet) on cognitive decline. Researchers track adherence to the diet by asking participants to fill out a food frequency questionnaire every six to 12 months. But many of us struggle to remember what we ate a day or two ago. So some researchers also rely on more objective measures to assess compliance. For the MIND diet assessment, researchers are also tracking biomarkers in the blood and urine — vitamins such as folate, B12 and vitamin E, plus levels of certain antioxidants.</p>

<h3>Weighty survey&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Lengthy food frequency questionnaires (a snapshot of some questions below) are a common tool for assessing an individual’s eating habits over time. But the accuracy of results depends on how well participants can recall what they ate and how often.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="3115171" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/070222_dementia-diet_inline" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline.jpg" data-orig-size="680,733" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="070222_dementia-diet_inline" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-355x383.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-417x450.jpg" loading="lazy" width="680" height="733" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline.jpg" alt="food frequency questionnaire screenshot showing questions about how often you eat doughnuts, french fries and fresh peaches" class="wp-image-3115171" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-355x383.jpg 355w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-417x450.jpg 417w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-173x186.jpg 173w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070222_dementia-diet_inline-538x580.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3115171">NIH</span></figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>Another difficulty is that these surveys often don’t account for variables that could be really important, like how the food was prepared and where it came from. Was the fish grilled? Fried? Slathered in butter? “Those things can matter,” says dementia researcher Nathaniel Chin of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<p>Plus there are the things researchers can’t control. For example, how does the food interact with an individual’s medications and microbiome? “We know all of those factors have an interplay,” Chin says.</p>



<p>The few clinical trials looking at dementia and diet seem to measure different things, so it’s hard to make comparisons. In 2018, Radd-Vagenas and her colleagues looked at all the trials that had studied the impact of the Mediterranean diet on cognition. There were five at the time. “What struck me even then was how variable the interventions were,” she says. “Some of the studies didn’t even mention olive oil in their intervention. Now, how can you run a Mediterranean diet study and not mention olive oil?”</p>



<p>Another tricky aspect is recruitment. The kind of people who sign up for clinical trials tend to be more educated, more motivated and have healthier lifestyles. That can make differences between the intervention group and the control group difficult to spot. And if the study shows an effect, whether it will apply to the broader, more diverse population comes into question. To sum up, these studies are difficult to design, difficult to conduct and often difficult to interpret.</p>



<p>Kaeberlein studies aging, not dementia specifically, but he follows the research closely and acknowledges that the lack of clear answers can be frustrating. “I get the feeling of wanting to throw up your hands,” he says. But he points out that there may not be a single answer. Many diets can help people maintain a healthy weight and avoid diabetes, and thus reduce the risk of dementia. Beyond that obvious fact, he says, “it’s hard to get definitive answers.”</p>



<h4>A better way</h4>



<p>In July 2021, Yassine gathered with more than 30 other dementia and nutrition experts for a virtual symposium to discuss the myriad challenges and map out a path forward. The speakers noted several changes that might improve the research.</p>



<p>One idea is to focus on populations at high risk. For example, one clinical trial is looking at the impact of low- and high-fat diets on short-term changes in the brain in people who carry the genetic variant <em>APOE4</em>, a risk factor for Alzheimer’s. One small study suggested that a high-fat Western diet actually improved cognition in some individuals. Researchers hope to get clarity on that surprising result.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I get the feeling of wanting to throw up your hands.”</p><cite>Matt Kaeberlein</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Another possible fix is redefining how researchers measure success. Hypertension and diabetes are both well-known risk factors for dementia. So rather than running a clinical trial that looks at whether a particular diet can affect dementia, researchers could look at the impact of diet on one of these risk factors. Plenty of studies have assessed the impact of diet on hypertension and diabetes, but Yassine knows of none launched with dementia prevention as the ultimate goal.</p>



<p>Yassine envisions a study that recruits participants at risk of developing dementia because of genetics or cardiovascular disease and then looks at intermediate outcomes. “For example, a high-salt diet can be associated with hypertension, and hypertension can be associated with dementia,” he says. If the study shows that the diet lowers hypertension, “we achieved our aim.” Then the study could enter a legacy period during which researchers track these individuals for another decade to determine whether the intervention influences cognition and dementia.</p>



<p>One way to amplify the signal in a clinical trial is to combine diet with other interventions likely to reduce the risk of dementia. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability, or FINGER, trial, which began in 2009, did just that. Researchers enrolled more than 1,200 individuals ages 60 to 77 who were at an elevated risk of developing dementia and had average or slightly impaired performance on cognition tests. Half received nutritional guidance, worked out at a gym, engaged in online brain-training games and had routine visits with a nurse to talk about managing dementia risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. The other half received only general health advice.</p>



<p>After two years, the control group had a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60461-5/fulltext">25 percent greater cognitive decline than the intervention group</a>. It was the first trial, reported in the <em>Lancet </em>in 2015, to show that targeting multiple risk factors could slow the pace of cognitive decline.</p>



<p>Now researchers are testing this approach in more than 30 countries. Christy Tangney, a nutrition researcher at Rush University in Chicago, is one of the investigators on the U.S. arm of the study, <a href="https://www.alzheimers-illinois.org/wp/2021/12/20/new-phase-for-u-s-pointer-study/">enrolling 2,000 people ages 60 to 79 who have at least one dementia risk factor</a>. The study is called POINTER, or <a href="https://alz.org/us-pointer/overview.asp">U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the research — <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.055289">organizers had to pause the trial briefly</a> — but Tangney expects to have results in the next few years.</p>



<p>This kind of multi-intervention study makes sense, Chin says. “One of the reasons why things are so slow in our field is we’re trying to address a heterogeneous disease with one intervention at a time. And that’s just not going to work.” A trial that tests multiple interventions “allows for people to not be perfect,” he adds. Maybe they can’t follow the diet exactly, but they can stick to the workout program, which might have an effect on its own. The drawback in these kinds of studies, however, is that it’s impossible to tease out the contribution of each individual intervention.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Embracing complexity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To untangle the role of diet in dementia, researchers are designing trials that intervene earlier in life and last longer. Some studies combine multiple interventions, like diet, exercise and brain training, as well as measure a wider range of outcomes. </p>



<h6>Dementia and diet studies are due a makeover</h6>

<h4>Preemptive guidelines</h4>



<p>Two major reports came out in recent years addressing dementia prevention. The first, from the World Health Organization in 2019, <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550543">recommends a healthy, balanced diet for all adults</a>, and notes that the Mediterranean diet may help people who have normal to mildly impaired cognition.</p>



<p>The 2020<em> Lancet </em>Commission report, however, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext">does not include diet in its list of modifiable risk factors, at least not yet</a>. “Nutrition and dietary components are challenging to research with controversies still raging around the role of many micronutrients and health outcomes in dementia,” the report notes. The authors point out that a Mediterranean or the similar Scandinavian diet might help prevent cognitive decline in people with intact cognition, but “how long the exposure has to be or during which ages is unclear.” Neither report recommends any supplements.</p>



<p>Plenty of people are waiting for some kind of advice to follow. Improving how these studies are done might enable scientists to finally sort out what kinds of diets can help hold back the heartbreaking damage that comes with Alzheimer’s disease. For some people, that knowledge might be enough to create change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“One of the reasons why things are so slow in our field is we’re trying to address a heterogeneous disease with one intervention at a time. And that’s just not going to work.”</p><cite>Nathaniel Chin</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Inevitably, if you’ve had Alzheimer’s in your family, you want to know, ‘What can I do today to potentially reduce my risk?’ ” says molecular biologist Heather Snyder, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer’s Association.</p>



<p>But changing long-term dietary habits can be hard. The foods we eat aren’t just fuel; our diets represent culture and comfort and more. “Food means so much to us,” Chin says.</p>



<p>“Even if you found the perfect diet,” he adds, “how do you get people to agree to and actually change their habits to follow that diet?” The MIND diet, for example, suggests people eat less than one serving of cheese a week. In Wisconsin, where Chin is based, that’s a nonstarter, he says.</p>



<p>But it’s not just about changing individual behaviors. Radd-Vagenas and other researchers hope that if they can show the brain benefits of some of these diets in rigorous studies, policy changes might follow. For example, research shows that lifestyle changes can have a big impact on type 2 diabetes. As a result, many insurance providers now pay for coaching programs that help participants maintain healthy diet and exercise habits.</p>



<p>“You need to establish policies. You need to change cities, change urban design. You need to do a lot of things to enable healthier choices to become easier choices,” Radd-Vagenas says. But that takes meatier data than exist now.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/07/05/most-of-us-dont-have-a-desire-for-unlimited-wealth/">Most of us don’t have a desire for unlimited wealth</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Do humans always want more, or are we sometimes just happy with our lot? This debate has long raged in multiple disciplines: economics, politics, and even philosophy. And whether an unlimited desire for more is inherent or a product of capitalism is equally hotly contested.</p>



<p>Paul G. Bain from the University of Bath and Renata Bongiorno from Bath Spa University explore this question in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00902-y">new paper</a> published in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>. They find that the assumption we always want more, no matter how much we have, may not be completely accurate: while some of us do have unlimited desire for wealth, they are not the majority.</p>



<span id="more-47935"></span>



<p>The first study included around 2000 participants from both advanced and economically developing countries, including the US, UK, France, South Africa, China, Russia, and Brazil. As part of a larger study, participants were asked to imagine their absolutely ideal life, and to consider how much money they would want in this ideal life. They were then asked whether they wanted to enter one of eight hypothetical lotteries, each with a prize ranging from $10,000 to $100 billion. After this, participants indicated the most important change they would make with the money.</p>



<p>The second study recruited nearly 6000 participants from a wider number of countries, including from the Middle East, Africa, Central America, North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Participants in this study completed the same measures as in the first.</p>



<p>The results were similar in both studies. Relatively few participants chose the smallest values, but there was a peak between $1 million and $10 million, with a large number of participants choosing these lotteries. Interest in the larger figures then declined, with only a small number of people choosing $1 billion. But a significant number of people chose the largest, essentially “unlimited” figure of $100 billion. In the first study, for instance, 32% of Americans picked this amount, though only 8% of those from China chose this. In the second study, Indonesia had the highest proportion of participants selecting unlimited amounts at 39%, and Russia the lowest at 11%. However, it’s worth noting that although a substantial number of people did pick this “unlimited” amount of money across the studies, they were always a minority.</p>



<p>In terms of the nationality of participants, the proportion of those selecting unlimited amounts was similar across more and less developed countries, despite the fact “luxury and consumption” is encouraged in more developed countries, as the authors point out. Where there was a difference, however, was between countries where the group is prioritised over the self: participants from these countries were more likely to select the unlimited lottery than those from more individualistic nations. Younger people and those who live in cities were also more likely to select the unlimited lottery, though there was no variation by gender, class, education or political ideology.</p>



<p>When asked what they would use the money for, those who selected the unlimited lottery were  more likely to say they wanted to use their money to address social problems — perhaps why this choice was more prevalent in collectivist societies. However, the majority of these participants still stated they would use the money for themselves. When asked about their values, participants who chose the unlimited figure were also no more likely to care about the welfare of others, but did place more importance on their own personal interests.</p>



<p>The study suggests that the idea we all want unlimited resources is probably not accurate. Further research could help us pinpoint exactly what drives our desire for certain amounts of money, limited or unlimited: for instance, it would be interesting to know whether people&#8217;s views on extreme wealth and inequality influence their decisions.</p>



<p>Overall, the study’s results could help us move towards a more sustainable and less unequal way of thinking about resources and wealth. As the team writes, “normative beliefs guide behaviour even as they are inaccurate”: in other words, we sometimes fail to act on our own values because we think we are in the minority. Having limited wants, the study suggests, is normal; understanding this more thoroughly could help us consume less, even as materialistic societies encourage us to consume more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/07/04/racial-biases-shape-the-way-people-interpret-body-poses/">Racial biases shape the way people interpret body poses</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>People reliably interpret expansive poses — with the arms and legs spread and the head held high — as a signal of dominance, or power. But work to date on perceptions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc">body poses</a> has focused on White targets, note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-62512-001">new paper</a> in the J<em>ournal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em>. As research shows that Black people are often stereotyped as aggressive, hostile and threatening, might an expansive pose lead others to perceive them as being more aggressive than a White person holding their body in exactly the same way?</p>



<p>Francine Karmali at the University of Toronto and Kerry Kawakami at York University found this is indeed the case — at least for Black men. They also report evidence that this could have all kinds of impacts on a Black man’s professional and personal life.</p>



<span id="more-47930"></span>



<p>In an initial study, 111 White undergraduate students were shown photos of White and Black men in a range of settings (behind or in front of a table, for example), adopting either an expansive pose or a constrictive pose (with the limbs held close to the body). Based on their impressions from the photos alone, they rated each target for dominance, aggression, competence and warmth. The team found that, compared with constrictive poses, expansive poses got higher dominance ratings for both racial groups. However, while this higher dominance was linked to greater competence in White men, for Black men it was linked to greater competence but also more aggression.</p>



<p>The second study involved not just White but other non-Black students. They were told that they were going to see images of business school students who had just finished a summer internship and been offered paid internships for the next year — but some had got more prestigious internships with better salaries. Their task was to rate how well they thought each student had done on their summer internship assessment and to predict the salary range for their new internship. The researchers found that White and Black men in expansive poses got better ratings than those in constrictive poses — they were judged to be more successful. But this effect was significantly bigger for White targets.</p>



<p>Next, a fresh group of participants (again all non-Black) were shown a selection of the photos, and asked to choose a partner to work with on a relationship-building task. The results showed that participants were more likely to pick White men in expansive vs constrictive poses. However, an expansive vs constrictive pose didn’t make Black men any more likely to be chosen as partners. A follow-up study replicated this finding and also suggested that perceptions of aggression could be responsible: for Black, but not White, targets, expansive poses were associated with more aggression.</p>



<p>While there were a few inconsistencies in some findings on individual ratings across the studies, the work suggests that White men benefit more from expansive poses than Black people do. Whether or not this is also the case for White and Black women is yet to be explored.</p>



<p>But, as the team notes, there could be all kinds of ramifications. For example, adopting an expansive pose in a job interview in an attempt to convey confidence and competence could be less effective for a Black than for a White man. And for a Black but not White man, adopting an expansive pose in a criminal trial in an attempt to project self-assured innocence might be interpreted by non-Black jury members as aggression, and affect judgements of guilt. If expansive poses are linked with aggression for Black men, this might even influence a police officer’s decision to shoot, they argue. They also make this point: “When officers instruct people to raise their hands and to spread their arms and legs, these expansive poses may increase racial biases.”</p>



<p>In fact, write Karmali and Kawakami, there are all kinds of potential scenarios (including in demonstrations and protest marches) when expansive poses may have a positive impact for White people but have little effect or even a negative impact for Black people. “Thus, while one aspect of White male privilege is that White men are allowed to act bold, and may even be rewarded for this boldness, Black men do not benefit to the same extent or are even penalised for such nonverbal behaviours,” the pair concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-triassic-mass-extinction-volcano-survival">Feathers may have helped dinosaurs survive the Triassic mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Widespread volcanic eruptions around 202 million years ago had a profound effect on Earth’s climate, triggering a mass extinction event that killed off three-fourths of the planet’s species, including many large reptiles. Yet dinosaurs, somehow, survived and went on to thrive.</p>



<p>Dinosaurs are often thought of as heat-loving, well suited to the steamy greenhouse environment of the Triassic Period. But the secret to their survival may have been how well adapted they were to the cold, unlike other reptiles of the time. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abo6342">dinosaurs’ warm coats of feathers</a> could have helped the creatures weather relatively brief but intense bouts of volcanic winter associated with the massive eruptions, researchers report July 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>&#8220;We’ve known for a while that there were probably volcanic winters” associated with the massive eruptions, says paleontologist Paul Olsen of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Along with carbon dioxide, volcanoes spew sulfur particles into the atmosphere that can darken skies for years and lower global temperatures — as the Philippines’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geoengineering-tactic-cool-planet-could-hurt-crops">Mount Pinatubo did after its powerful 1991</a> eruption (<em>SN: 8/8/18</em>). “But how [such winters] fit into the picture of the end-Triassic mass extinction has been very unclear.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Olsen and his colleagues present the first physical evidence that not only did such winters occur at the end of the Triassic, but also that dinosaurs were there to weather them. At a site called the Junggar Basin, which at the close of the Triassic was found high in the Arctic Circle, the team identified rock fragments that could only have been deposited by ancient ice alongside the footprints of dinosaurs.</p>



<p>“There is a stereotype that dinosaurs always lived in lush tropical jungles,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. “But this new research shows convincingly that the higher latitudes would have been freezing and even covered in ice during parts of the year” at the beginning of the rise of the dinosaurs, he says.</p>



<p>The Triassic Period ended with a bang beginning around 202 million years ago, as the supercontinent Pangea began to break apart. Massive volcanic eruptions burst forth as the crust split, opening up a basin that became the Atlantic Ocean. The hardened lava from those eruptions now spans 7 million square kilometers across Africa, Europe and North and South America, forming a rock sequence collectively known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, or CAMP.</p>



<p>Carbon dioxide levels were extremely high during the late Triassic and early Jurassic, much of it now thought to have been pumped into the atmosphere by those eruptions. Earth has been assumed to have been in a steamy greenhouse state as a result. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that there’s no evidence of any polar ice sheets at the time; instead, thick forests extended all the way to the poles.</p>



<p>The Junggar Basin, in what’s now northwestern China, was one such region, covered with forests of conifers and deciduous trees growing alongside a massive ancient lake. Dinosaurs certainly lived there: No bones have yet been discovered at the site, but many footprints of the creatures are preserved in the shallow-water siltstones and sandstones that formed at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>About 202 million years ago, most of the world’s landmasses were stitched together into the supercontinent Pangea (illustrated). Dinosaur fossils, including footprints, have been found at sites (dots) across the supercontinent. At the Junggar Basin (red oval) in what’s now northwestern China, scientists discovered evidence of frigid winters at the end of the Triassic Period alongside dinosaur tracks.</p>

<p>The new data suggest that — despite the extremely high CO<sub>2 </sub>levels — this region also experienced harsh, frigid winters, with the lake at least partially freezing over. The evidence comes from the same rocks that bear the footprints. Analyzing the distribution of grain sizes in the rocks, the researchers determined that a large portion of the grains weren’t part of the original lake mud, but had been carried there from elsewhere.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation, Olsen says, is that these grains are “ice-rafted debris” — a well-known phenomenon in which bits of rock freeze to the base of ice along a shoreline, and then hitch a ride with the ice as it eventually drifts into open water. As the floating ice melts, the bits of rock sink, deposited in new territory.</p>



<p>Volcanic winters might last for tens or even hundreds of years, Olsen says, depending on how long volcanoes continue to erupt. In this case, the huge sheets of lava linked to the CAMP eruptions point to at least tens of thousands of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1705378114">years of eruption pulses</a>, maybe even a million years. That could have kept the winters going for a good long time — long enough to drive many less-well-insulated reptiles off the face of the Earth, he adds. Episodes of those freezing conditions may have even extended all the way to the tropics, the team says.</p>



<p>Evidence of feathers has been found in the fossils of many types of dinosaurs, from carnivorous theropods to herbivorous ornithischians. Recent reports that flying reptiles called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-brightly-colored-feathers-heads-fossil-skull-soft-tissue">pterosaurs had feathers</a> too now suggests that the insulating fuzz has been around for even longer than once thought — possibly appearing as early as 250 million years ago, in a common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>).</p>



<p>Thanks to those insulating feathers, dinosaurs were able to survive the lengthy winters that ensued during the end-Triassic mass extinction, Olsen and colleagues say. Dinosaurs might then have been able to spread rapidly during the Jurassic, occupying niches left vacant by less hardy reptiles.</p>



<p>This study “shows the complexity of disentangling not only the success of certain groups, but also the causes and effects of mass extinction events,” says paleontologist Randall Irmis of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not connected with the study. “There’s a pretty good consensus that [the CAMP eruptions are] the cause of the mass extinction — but there are a lot of subtleties we haven’t appreciated.”</p>



<p>That dinosaurs living in the far north at the time were able to survive due to their feathery insulation makes sense, Irmis says. But whether a volcanic winter caused by dimming could have extended far enough south to freeze the tropics too — giving dinosaurs a similar advantage there — isn’t yet clear. “Dimming is a global effect, but how that plays out is a lot more severe at the poles compared to low latitudes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feathers are probably just one of many reasons why dinosaurs diversified and spread rapidly across the globe at the start of the Jurassic, Irmis says. “There’s a lot that plays into why they became such a successful group.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-mineral-kingdom-classification-crystal-search-life">A new look at the ‘mineral kingdom’ may transform how we search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>If every mineral tells a story, then geologists now have their equivalent of <em>The Arabian Nights</em>.</p>



<p>For the first time, scientists have cataloged every different way that every known mineral can form and put all of that information in one place. This collection of mineral origin stories hints that Earth could have harbored life earlier than previously thought, quantifies the importance of water as the most transformative ingredient in geology, and may change how researchers look for signs of life and water on other planets.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“This is just going to be an explosion,” says Robert Hazen, a mineralogist and astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “You can ask a thousand questions now that we couldn’t have answered before.”</p>



<p>For over 100 years, scientists have defined minerals in terms of “what,” focusing on their structure and chemical makeup. But that can make for an incomplete picture. For example, though all diamonds are a kind of crystalline carbon, three different diamonds might tell three different stories, Hazen says. One could have formed 5 billion years ago in a distant star, another may have been born in a meteorite impact, and a third could have been baked deep below the Earth’s crust.</p>

<p>So Hazen and his colleagues set out to define a different approach to mineral classification. This new angle focuses on the “how” by thinking about minerals as things that evolve out of the history of life, Earth and the solar system, he and his team report July 1 in a pair of studies in <em>American Mineralogist. </em>The researchers <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8099">defined 57 main ways</a> that the “mineral kingdom” forms, with options ranging from condensation out of the space between stars to formation in the excrement of bats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The information in the catalog isn’t new, but it was previously scattered throughout thousands of scientific papers. The “audacity” of their work, Hazen says, was to go through and compile it all together for the more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8105">5,600 known types of minerals</a>. That makes the catalog a one-stop shop for those who want to use minerals to understand the past.</p>



<p>The compilation also allowed the team to take a step back and think about mineral evolution from a broader perspective. Patterns immediately popped out. One of the new studies shows that over half of all known mineral kinds form in ways that ought to have been possible on the newborn Earth. The implication: Of all the geologic environments that scientists have considered as potential <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">crucibles for the beginning of life on Earth</a>, most could have existed as early as 4.3 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/24/20)</em>. Life, therefore, may have formed almost as soon as Earth did, or at the very least, had more time to arise than scientists have thought. Rocks with traces of life <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">date to only 3.4 billion years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That would be a very, very profound implication — that the potential for life is baked in at the very beginning of a planet,” says Zachary Adam, a paleobiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved in the new studies.</p>



<p>The exact timing of when conditions ripe for life arose is based on “iffy” models, though, says Frances Westall, a geobiologist at the Center for Molecular Biophysics in Orléans, France, who was also not part of Hazen’s team. She thinks that scientists need more data before they can be sure. But, she says, “the principle is fantastic.”</p>



<p>The new results also show how essential water has been to making most of the minerals on Earth. Roughly 80 percent of known mineral types need H<sub>2</sub>O to form, the team reports.</p>



<p>“Water is just incredibly important,” Hazen says, adding that the estimate is conservative. “It may be closer to 90 percent.”</p>

<p>Taken one way, this means that if researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-lost-missing-crust-space-simulation">see water</a> on a planet like Mars, they can guess that it has a rich mineral ecosystem (<em>SN: 3/16/21)</em>. But flipping this idea may be more useful: Scientists could identify what minerals are on the Red Planet and then use the new catalog to work backward and figure out what its environment was like in the past. A group of minerals, for example, might be explainable only if there had been water, or even life.</p>



<p>Right now, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">do this sort of detective work</a> on just a few minerals at a time (<em>SN: 5/11/20)</em>. But if researchers want to make the most of the samples collected on other planets, something more comprehensive is needed, Adam says, like the new study’s framework.</p>



<p>And that’s just the beginning. “The value of this [catalog] is that it’s ongoing and potentially multigenerational,” Adam says. “We can go back to it again and again and again for different kinds of questions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we have a lot more we can do,” agrees Shaunna Morrison, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution and coauthor of the new studies. “We’re just scratching the surface.”</p>

<p>In the beginning, scientists believe there was an interstellar gas cloud of all the elements comprising the Earth. A billion or so years later, the Earth was a globe of concentric spheres with a solid iron inner core, a liquid iron outer core and a liquid silicate mantle…. The current theory is that the primeval cloud’s materials accreted … and that sometime after accretion, the iron, melted by radioactive heating, sank toward the center of the globe…. Now another concept is gaining ground: that the Earth may have accreted … with core formation and accretion occurring simultaneously.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Most scientists now agree that the core formed as materials that make up Earth collided and glommed together and that the process was driven by heat from the smashups. The planet’s heart is primarily made of iron, nickel and some oxygen, but what other elements may dwell there and in what forms remains an open question. Recently, scientists proposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">the inner core could be superionic</a>, with liquid hydrogen flowing through an iron and silicon lattice (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/07/01/people-with-no-minds-eye-have-less-vivid-and-detailed-memories/">People with no mind’s eye have less vivid and detailed memories</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>When we’re asked to imagine a scene or object, most of us are able to conjure up an image in our mind’s eye. But about 2-5% of the population can’t do this: they have a condition called <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/03/bonus-episode-whats-it-like-to-have-no-minds-eye/">aphantasia</a>, and are unable to produce mental imagery at all.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001809#">a study</a> published in <em>Cognition</em> has found that aphantasia can affect memory abilities too. The researchers report that aphantasics have less detailed and rich memories for events in their lives: a finding that not only reveals more about the condition, but also highlights the key role of mental imagery in memory generally.</p>



<span id="more-47921"></span>



<p>Past work had shown that people with aphantasia report almost no mental imagery when recalling past events from their lives or when thinking about potential future events. But these findings were based on participants rating their own abilities, note Alexei Dawes and colleagues from the University of New South Wales. So the team decided to examine whether aphantasic participants also show memory deficits in more objective measures.</p>



<p>The researchers recruited 30 participants with aphantasia and 30 control participants who didn’t have any problems with mental imagery.  All participants filled in questionnaires asking them to report the vividness off various kinds of mental imagery, including when recalling scenes from their lives. The researchers found that — as in past studies — the aphantasic participants reported having less vivid mental imagery (although, again consistent with past work, their spatial imagery was just as good as that of control participants).</p>



<p>To get a more “objective” measure of memory deficits, the team then looked at the kind of information people provided when describing their memories. Participants were asked to remember six events in their lives, as well as think about six hypothetical future events, and write a description of each. For their analysis, the researchers looked at different categories of details contained in these descriptions (for instance, details relating to participants’ sensations, thoughts, or emotions). After writing each description, participants also reported their own subjective experiences of that particular event, such as how vivid it was and how much emotion they felt.</p>



<p>The team found that aphantasic participants gave fewer details than control participants about both kinds of event. This effect seemed to be driven specifically by the fact that they wrote down fewer visual details; the groups didn’t differ in the amount of detail they gave that involved other senses like smell or hearing, or that concerned other aspects of the event like thoughts or emotions they experienced.</p>



<p>The two groups also differed in how they reported experiencing the memories and imagining the future events. Compared to controls, aphantasics indicated that the events were less vivid and contained fewer sensory or spatial details, for instance, and they also reported experiencing less emotion when thinking about the event.</p>



<p>Overall, the results show that people with aphantasia have less vivid and detailed memories — particularly when it comes to visual details — and this this effect is clear whether they are asked about their experience or tested in more &#8220;objective&#8221; ways. The authors write that their findings represent the “first robust behavioural evidence that visual imagery absence is associated with a significantly reduced capacity to simulate the past and construct the future”.</p>



<p>The very fact that aphantasics show these deficits also implies that mental imagery is generally an important part of recalling events or imagining future ones. This probably isn’t a huge surprise — but as the authors point out, is something that has been hard to test empirically until now. However, the study also shows that mental imagery isn’t everything: people with aphantasia were still able to retrieve memories, after all. Instead, it seems that mental imagery is specifically involved in that aspect of memory that involves “re-living” events in our minds.</p>

                <p>This month, a <em>PLOS Medicine</em> study has found that children exposed to road traffic noise at school exhibit signs of relatively slower attention spans and working memory development compared to those educated in a quieter environment. The study done in Europe could spark the creation of environmental noise policies to protect school environments. Learn more about the study design in our monthly Research Highlights summary below or check out the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Road traffic noise is the most widespread environmental and transportation noise source in Europe and the second most detrimental environmental factor for ill health in Europe after air pollution. An increasing number of epidemiological studies in adults detail the health impacts of transportation noise, but little is known about the effects in children.</p>

<p>Maria Foraster and colleagues at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) studied a sample of 2,680 children aged 7-10 years at 38 schools in Barcelona, Spain between January 2012 and March 2013. The children completed computerized cognitive tests four times during one year to assess the development of working memory, complex working memory, and inattentiveness. The researchers measured markers of annual exposure to intensity levels and fluctuation in road traffic noise both inside and outside the schools at the beginning of the year and estimated exposure to intensity levels outdoors at home using Barcelona&rsquo;s road traffic noise map for 2012. Their analyses also controlled for levels of traffic-related air pollution and sociodemographics, among other factors.</p>



<p>In the children, exposure to higher intensity and fluctuation in road traffic noise measured outside the school was associated with a slower development of working memory, complex working memory, and attention over 12 months. Inside the classroom, associations with all cognitive development measures were more evident for exposure to noise fluctuation than for intensity levels. No associations were found for exposure to road traffic noise at home.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The team did not measure past noise exposure in their population which could affect the test scores. However, the authors reported that 98% of the children had attended the same school at least for one year and that noise levels are generally steady over time. The findings are of public health relevance given the number of children around the world who are exposed to road traffic noise in schools, but similar testing should be done elsewhere before the findings are generalized to other populations.</p>



<p>Foraster adds, &ldquo;Children exposed to road traffic noise at school and in the classroom showed slower cognitive development in terms of working memory and attention compared to children attending quieter schools.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nerve-cooler-pain-relief-electronic-implant">This soft, electronic ‘nerve cooler’ could be a new way to relieve pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>A flexible electronic implant could one day make pain management a lot more chill.</p>



<p>Created from materials that dissolve in the body, the device encircles nerves with an evaporative cooler. Implanted in rats, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8532">the cooler blocked pain signals</a> from zipping up to the brain, bioengineer John Rogers and colleagues report in the July 1 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Though far from ready for human use, a future version could potentially let “patients dial up or down the pain relief they need at any given moment,” says Rogers, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists already knew that low temperatures can numb nerves in the body. Think of frozen fingers in the winter, Rogers says. But mimicking this phenomenon with an electronic implant isn’t easy. Nerves are fragile, so scientists need something that gently hugs the tissues. And an ideal implant would be absorbed by the body, so doctors wouldn’t have to remove it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Made from water-soluble materials, the team’s device features a soft cuff that wraps around a nerve like toilet paper on a roll. Tiny channels snake down its rubbery length. When liquid coolant that’s pumped through the channels evaporates, the process draws heat from the underlying nerve. A temperature sensor helps scientists hit the sweet spot — cold enough to block pain but not too cold to damage the nerve.</p>



<p>The researchers wrapped the implant around a nerve in rats and tested how they responded to having a paw poked. With the nerve cooler switched on, scientists could apply about seven times as much pressure as usual before the animals pulled their paws away. That’s a sign that the rats’ senses had grown sluggish, Rogers says.</p>



<p>He envisions the device being used to treat pain after surgery, rather than chronic pain. The cooler connects to an outside power source and would be tethered to patients like an IV line. They could control the level of pain relief by adjusting the coolant’s flow rate. Such a system might offer targeted relief without the downsides of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-oklahoma-opioid-trial-highlights-deadly-drugs-epidemic">addictive pain medications like opioids</a><em>,</em> Rogers suggests <em>(SN: 8/27/19)</em>.</p>



<p>Now the researchers want to explore how long they can apply the cooling effect without damaging tissues, Rogers says. In experiments, the longest that they cooled rats’ nerves was for about 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If treating pain, cooling would have to go on for a much longer period of time,” says Seward Rutkove, a nerve physiologist at Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. Still, he adds, the device is “an interesting proof of concept and should definitely be pursued.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bone-loss-density-astronaut-recovery-gravity">Six months in space leads to a decade’s worth of long-term bone loss</a></h4>

              
                <p>You might want to bring your dumbbells on that next spaceflight.</p>



<p>During space missions lasting six months or longer, astronauts can experience bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging. A year of recovery in Earth’s gravity <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13461-1">rebuilds about half of that lost bone strength</a>, researchers report June 30 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Bones “are a living organ,” says Leigh Gabel, an exercise scientist at the University of Calgary in Canada. “They’re alive and active, and they&#8217;re constantly remodeling.” But without gravity, bones lose strength.</p>





<p>Gabel and her colleagues tracked 17 astronauts, 14 men and three women with the average age of 47, who spent from four to seven months in space. The team used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, or HR-pQCT, which can measure 3-D bone microarchitecture on scales of 61 microns, finer than the thickness of human hair, to image the bone structure of the tibia in the lower leg and the radius in the lower arm. The team took these images at four points in time — before spaceflight, when the astronauts returned from space, and then six months and one year later — and used them to calculate bone strength and density.</p>



<p>Astronauts in space for less than six months were able to regain their preflight bone strength after a year back in Earth’s gravity. But those in space longer had permanent bone loss in their shinbones, or tibias, equivalent to a decade of aging. Their lower-arm bones, or radii, showed almost no loss, likely because these aren’t weight-bearing bones, says Gabel.</p>



<p>Increasing weight lifting exercises in space could help alleviate bone loss, says Steven Boyd, also a Calgary exercise scientist. “A whole bunch of struts and beams all held together give your bone its overall strength,” says Boyd. “Those struts or beams are what we lose in spaceflight.” Once these microscopic tissues called trabeculae are gone, you can’t rebuild them, but you can strengthen the remaining ones, he says. The researchers found the remaining bone thickened upon return to Earth’s gravity.</p>

<p>“With longer spaceflight, we can expect bigger bone loss and probably a bigger problem with recovery,” says physiologist Laurence Vico of the University of Saint-Étienne in France, who was not part of the study. That’s especially concerning given that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">a crewed future mission to, say, Mars</a> would last at least two years (<em>SN: 7/15/20</em>). She adds that space agencies should also consider other bone health measures, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-for-thought/zero-gravity-diet">such as nutrition</a>, to reduce bone absorption and increase bone formation (<em>SN: 3/8/05</em>). “It&#8217;s probably a cocktail of countermeasure that we will have to find,” Vico says.</p>



<p>Gabel, Boyd and their colleagues hope to gain insight on how spending more than seven months in space affects bones. They are part of a planned NASA project to study the effects of a year in space on more than a dozen body systems. “We really hope that people hit a plateau, that they stop losing bone after a while,” says Boyd.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Few things are as stressful as listening to your baby crying — and excessive crying is clearly not good for the baby, either. <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/kangaroo-mother-care-may-boost-the-survival-of-newborn-premature-babies/">Skin-to-skin contact is widely used in the first hours after a birth</a>, with benefits for infants and parents. But, according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-66006-001">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>, a daily hour of skin-to-skin contact for weeks afterwards is beneficial, too: it reduces crying and improves sleep.</p>



<span id="more-47916"></span>



<p>Kelly Cooijmans at Radboud University, in the Netherlands, and her colleagues recruited Dutch healthy first-time mothers with full-term infants for their randomized controlled trial. On signing up while pregnant, the women knew they were taking part in a trial aimed at improving infant crying and sleep, but not what the intervention would be.</p>



<p>Prolonged mother-infant skin-to-skin contact is not part of Dutch culture, the team notes. So when one group was instructed to perform &#8220;care as usual&#8221;, extended skin-to-skin contact took place only immediately after birth. The other group was asked to ensure that their baby had an hour a day of this contact for five weeks. The mothers were also asked to report on a range of measures, including how long their infant cried and slept, for the first 12 weeks of their baby’s life. (As women in the Netherlands get 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, the team felt that this would all be practically feasible.)</p>



<p>Only relatively few women — 16 of an initial 64 in the daily contact group — did actually fully follow the protocol. Their babies cried less overall and had shorter individual crying bouts. In their first few days of life, they slept for longer, too. The data also suggested a dose-response relationship between skin contact and crying: more minutes of contact was associated with less crying and also, in the first days at least, more sleep. “Our findings suggest that extended [skin to skin contact] adds to the already beneficial effects during the first postnatal hours/days, at least regarding infant crying and sleeping,” the team writes.</p>



<p>There are various potential mechanisms. Warm, soft, human touch signals that a caregiver is there, close at hand. It is known to be calming. Skin-to-skin contact also specifically triggers the release of oxytocin in both the mother and infant, the team adds — and this has known stress-reducing effects. Advantages of the intervention are, the team writes, that it is “uncomplicated and low cost”.</p>



<p>However, while it might carry no immediate financial cost for women on paid maternity leave, the high drop-out rate certainly suggests that the mothers did perceive it to have other kinds of costs. In fact, 10% reported having trouble fitting it into their daily routine and 14% said that their own mental or physical recovery problems made it difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s true that when these women were recruited, there was no evidence that time invested in regular daily skin-to-skin contact could have a pay-off in terms of reduced crying, the team notes. Perhaps the new, preliminary data might encourage some new mothers to try the protocol. And there were some significant benefits. In week 2, for example, the team reports a daily crying duration of 106 minutes for those mothers who fully followed the protocol vs 129 for the control. That’s an average of 23 fewer minutes spent crying per day.</p>



<p>Still, it’s worth noting that the mothers in the intervention group paid for this with an hour a day of their time. Keeping a baby close in a sling can be tricky enough; ensuring you’re in a suitable place each day for an hour of bare skin-to-skin contact is clearly even more demanding. Whatever a mother’s circumstances, let’s not pretend that there are no or &#8220;low&#8221; costs attached to the potential benefits, because that places very little value on her invested time. </p>
