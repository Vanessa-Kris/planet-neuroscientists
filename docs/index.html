              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alhambra-palace-gold-ceiling-corrosion-purple-chemistry-spain">Why once-gold ceilings in Spain’s Alhambra palace have purple stains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Once upon a time, Spain&#8217;s hilltop Alhambra palace glittered with gold. Over the centuries, though, the Islamic citadel’s ornate, gilded structures on its ceilings and elsewhere fell into disrepair, with curious purple splotches marring them. The stains’ origins were a mystery. But scientists say they now understand the chemistry behind the purple tinge.</p>



<p>Analyses reveal that as the gilding decayed, it formed <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn2541">gold spheres invisible to the naked eye that are responsible for the purple color</a>, the researchers report online September 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The finding may have implications for understanding how other art and architecture degrades with time.</p>





<p>Medieval artisans crafted some Alhambra ceilings to look like a cave’s stalactites, then gilded them with a layer of tinfoil topped by a gold-and-silver alloy. In the 19th century, people covered the degrading gilding with gypsum, a white mineral found in plaster.</p>



<p>Geologist Carolina Cardell of Spain&#8217;s University of Granada first noticed purple stains on the gypsum in 1993, but she and her colleagues didn&#8217;t have the tools to understand the splotches back then. Things changed when the university obtained two types of electron microscopes. The microscopes couple to other instruments that reveal a sample&#8217;s chemical elements and compounds at the nanoscale.</p>

The blue color is the pigment lapis lazuli.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117060">C. Drahl</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Cardell&#8217;s colleague Carmen Navarrete, a former head of restoration at the Alhambra, died before the team could get answers. Cardell and electron microscopy expert Isabel Guerra, also of the University of Granada, soldiered on without Navarrete to examine layers of gilding, gypsum and stains from the Alhambra. “We said we have to finish this and dedicate this work to her,” Cardell says.</p>



<p>Dots in microscope images of the gypsum proved to be pure gold nanospheres, most of which are about 70 nanometers wide. Nanoparticles’ colors depend on their size, which influences their interactions with light, and 70 nanometers is the right size for a purple hue.</p>



<p>Based on the elements and compounds detected, Cardell and Guerra conclude that multiple <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rust-chronicles-humankinds-incessant-battle-corrosion">corrosion processes</a> formed the nanoparticles (<em>SN: 3/21/15</em>). Though pure gold is resistant to corrosion, the gold-and-silver alloy in the Alhambra is not. Flaws in the gilding let in moisture, including the Mediterranean&#8217;s chloride-rich airborne sea spray. That created chemical contacts between the gilding&#8217;s metals akin to those in a battery. As a result, the underlying tin corroded, pushing its way through defects in the alloy and covering some of the gold as grayish grime.</p>

<p>Different parts of the gold were thus exposed to different oxygen concentrations. That triggered further chemical reactions that dissolved some of the gold, paving the way for the spheres’ formation. Those spheres ended up settling in the gypsum, Cardell says.</p>



<p>&#8220;The level of detail of the study is phenomenal,&#8221; says Francesca Casadio, who heads the conservation science department at the Art Institute of Chicago. “Others are going to see these purplish hues and they are going to have a rubric to understand the phenomenon.”</p>



<p>Few reports of purple gold on damaged artwork and architecture exist. Cardell thinks that the white gypsum coating added to the Alhambra in the 19th century made the purple easy to notice. &#8220;We think that this purple color&#8230; is more widespread than people imagine.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-footprint-products-life-cycle-assessment-greenwashing">A carbon footprint life cycle assessment can cut down on greenwashing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today, you can buy a pair of sneakers partially made from carbon dioxide pulled out of the atmosphere. But measuring the carbon-reduction benefits of making that pair of sneakers with CO<sub>2</sub> is complex. There’s the fossil fuel that stayed in the ground, a definite carbon savings. But what about the energy cost of cooling the CO<sub>2</sub> into liquid form and transporting it to a production facility? And what about when your kid outgrows the shoes in six months and they can’t be recycled into a new product because those systems aren’t in place yet?</p>



<p>As companies try to reduce their carbon footprint, many are doing life cycle assessments to quantify the full carbon cost of products, from procurement of materials to energy use in manufacturing to product transport to user behavior and end-of-life disposal. It’s a mind-bogglingly difficult metric, but such bean-counting is needed to hold the planet to a livable temperature, says low-carbon systems expert Andrea Ramirez Ramirez of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.</p>





<p>Carbon accounting is easy to get wrong, she says. Differences in starting points for determining a product’s “lifetime” or assumptions about the energy sources can all affect the math.</p>



<p>Carbon use can be reduced at many points along the production chain—by using renewable energy in the manufacturing process, for instance, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3116899">by adding atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to the product</a>. But if other points along the chain are energy-intensive or emit CO<sub>2</sub>, she notes, the final tally may show a positive rather than a negative number.</p>



<p>A product is carbon negative only when its production actually removes carbon from the environment, temporarily or permanently. The Global CO<sub>2</sub> Initiative, with European and American universities, has created a <a href="https://www.globalco2initiative.org/evaluation/#feasibility">set of LCA guidelines</a> to standardize measurement so that carbon accounting is consistent and terms such as “carbon neutral” or “carbon negative” have a verifiable meaning.</p>

<p>Life cycle assessments are an attempt to measure the carbon costs of each step of the production, transport, use and disposal or recycling of a product.</p>

<p>In the rush to create products that can be touted as fighting climate change, however, some firms have been accused of “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-corporate-greenwashing-environment-climate">greenwashing</a>” – making products or companies appear more environmentally friendly than they really are. <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/171930/Greenwashing%20of%20Carbon%20Utilization%202022.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y">Examples of greenwashing</a>, according to a March 2022 analysis by mechanical engineers Grant Faber and Volker Sick of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor include labeling plastic garbage bags as recyclable when their whole purpose is to be thrown away; using labels such as “eco-friendly” or “100% Natural” without official certification; and claiming a better carbon footprint without acknowledging the existence of even better choices. An example would be “fuel-efficient” sport utility vehicles, which are only fuel efficient when compared with other SUVs rather than with smaller cars, public transit or bicycles. <s></s></p>



<p>Good LCA analysis, Sick says, can distinguish companies that are carbon-friendly in name only, from those that are truly helping the world clear the air.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-carbon-dioxide-capture-recycling-climate-change">How to make recyclable plastics out of CO2 to slow climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">It’s morning and you wake on a comfortable foam mattress made partly from greenhouse gas. You pull on a T-shirt and sneakers containing carbon dioxide pulled from factory emissions. After a good run, you stop for a cup of joe and guiltlessly toss the plastic cup in the trash, confident it will fully biodegrade into harmless organic materials. At home, you squeeze shampoo from a bottle that has lived many lifetimes, then slip into a dress fashioned from smokestack emissions. You head to work with a smile, knowing your morning routine has made Earth’s atmosphere a teeny bit carbon cleaner.</p>



<p>Sound like a dream? Hardly. These products are already sold around the world. And others are being developed. They’re part of a growing effort by academia and industry to reduce the damage caused by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">centuries of human activity that has sent CO<sub>2</sub></a> and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 16</em>).</p>





<p>The need for action is urgent. In its 2022 report, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, stated that<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf"> rising temperatures have already caused irreversible damage to the planet</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">increased human death and disease</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 8</em>). Meanwhile, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted continues to rise. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted last year that if current policy and growth trends continue, annual global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could rise from about 34 billion metric tons in 2020 to almost 43 billion by 2050.</p>



<p>Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, is one strategy for mitigating climate change long noted by the IPCC as having “considerable” potential. A technology that has existed since the 1970s, CCS traps CO<sub>2</sub> from smokestacks or ambient air and pumps it underground for permanent sequestration. Today, 27 CCS facilities operate around the world — 12 in the United States — <a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/resources/global-status-report/">storing an estimated 36 million tons of carbon per year</a>, according to the Global CCS Institute. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $3.5 billion in funding for four additional U.S. direct capture facilities.</p>



<p>But rather than just storing it, the captured carbon could be used to make things. This year for the first time, <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_Chapter06.pdf">the IPCC added carbon capture and utilization</a>, or CCU, to its list of options for drawing down atmospheric carbon. CCU captures CO<sub>2</sub> and incorporates it into carbon-containing products like cement, jet fuel and the raw materials for making plastics. Still in early stages of development and commercialization, CCU could reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 20 billion tons in 2050 — more than half of the world’s global emissions today, the IPCC estimates.</p>



<p>Such recognition was a big victory for a movement that has struggled to emerge from the shadow of its more established cousin, CCS, says chemist and global CCU expert Peter Styring of the University of Sheffield in England. Many CCU-related companies are springing up and collaborating with each other and with governments around the world, he adds.</p>



<p>The potential of CCU is “enormous,” both in terms of its volume and monetary potential, said mechanical engineer Volker Sick at a CCU conference in Brussels in April. Sick, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, directs the Global CO<sub>2</sub> Initiative, which promotes CCU as a mainstream climate solution. “We’re not talking about something that’s nice to do but doesn’t move the needle,” he added. “It moves the needle in many, many aspects.”</p>

<h4>The plastics paradox</h4>



<p>The use of carbon dioxide in products is not new. CO<sub>2</sub> is used to make soda fizzy, keep foods frozen (as dry ice) and convert ammonia to urea for fertilizer. What’s new is the focus on making products with CO<sub>2</sub> as a strategy to slow climate change. Today’s CCU market, estimated at $2 billion, could mushroom to $550 billion by 2040, according to Lux Research, a Boston-based market research firm. Much of this market is driven by adding CO<sub>2 </sub>to cement — which can improve its properties as well as reduce atmospheric carbon — and to jet fuel, which can lower the industry’s large carbon footprint. CO<sub>2</sub>-to-plastics is a niche market today, but the field aims to battle two crises at once: climate change and plastic pollution.</p>



<p>Plastics are made from fossil fuels, a mix of hydrocarbons formed by the remains of ancient organisms. Most plastics are produced by refining crude oil, which is then broken down into smaller molecules through a process called cracking. These smaller molecules, known as monomers, are the building blocks of polymers. Monomers such as ethylene, propylene, styrene and others are linked together to form plastics such as polyethylene (detergent bottles, toys, rigid pipes), polypropylene (water bottles, luggage, car parts) and polystyrene (plastic cutlery, CD cases, Styrofoam).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Anatomy of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; </h3>



<p>It takes a lot of energy to break the strong double bonds between the carbon (black) and oxygen atoms (red) in a carbon dioxide molecule. To save energy, researchers are experimenting with chemical and bioinspired catalysts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="496" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_plastics_inline3.png" alt="molecular structure of carbon dioxide showing one carbon atom in black and two oxygen atoms in pink" class="wp-image-3116969" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_plastics_inline3.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_plastics_inline3-525x383.png 525w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_plastics_inline3-617x450.png 617w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_plastics_inline3-255x186.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3116969">C. Chang</span></figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>But making plastics from fossil fuels is a carbon catastrophe. Each step in the plastics life cycle — extraction, transport, manufacture and disposal — emits massive amounts of greenhouse gases, mostly CO<sub>2</sub>, according to the Center for International Environmental Law, a nonprofit law firm based in Geneva and Washington, D.C. These emissions alone — more than 850 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2019 — <a href="https://www.ciel.org/plasticandclimate/">are enough to threaten global climate targets</a>.</p>



<p>And the numbers are about to get much worse. A 2018 report by the Paris-based intergovernmental International Energy Agency projected that global demand for plastics will increase from about 400 million tons in 2020 to nearly 600 million by 2050. Future demand is expected to be concentrated in developing countries and will vastly outstrip global recycling efforts.</p>



<p>Plastics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest">are a serious crisis for the environment</a>, from fossil fuel use to their buildup in landfills and oceans (<em>SN: 1/16/21, p. 4</em>). But we’re a society addicted to plastic and all it gives us — cell phones, computers, comfy Crocs. Is there a way to have our (plastic-wrapped) cake and eat it too?</p>



<p>Yes, says Sick. First, he argues, cap the oil wells. Next, make plastics from aboveground carbon. Today, there are products made of 20 to over 40 percent CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, he says, build a circular economy, one that reduces resource use, reuses products, then recycles them into other new products.</p>



<p>“Not only can we eliminate the fossil carbon as a source so that we don’t add to the aboveground carbon budget, but in the process we can also rethink <em>how</em> we make plastics,” Sick says. He suggests they be specifically designed “to live very, very long so that they don’t have to be replaced … or that they decompose in a benign manner.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;But creating plastics from thin air is not easy. CO<sub>2</sub> needs to be extracted, from the atmosphere or smokestacks, for example, using specialized equipment. It often needs to be compressed into liquid form and transported, generally through pipelines. Finally, to meet the overall goal of reducing the amount of carbon in the air, the chemical reaction that turns CO<sub>2</sub> into the building blocks of plastics must be run with as little extra energy as possible. Keeping energy use low is a special challenge when dealing with the carbon dioxide molecule.</p>



<h4>A bond that’s hard to break</h4>



<p>There’s a reason that carbon dioxide is such a potent greenhouse gas. It is incredibly stable and can linger in the atmosphere for 300 to 1,000 years. That stability makes CO<sub>2</sub> hard to break apart and add to other chemicals. Lots of energy is typically needed for the reaction.</p>



<p>“This is the fundamental energy problem of CO<sub>2</sub>,” says chemist Ian Tonks of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “Energy is necessary to fix CO<sub>2</sub> to plastics. We’re trying to find that energy in creative ways.”</p>



<p>Catalysts offer a possible answer. These substances can increase the rate of a chemical reaction, and thus reduce the need for energy. Scientists in the CO<sub>2</sub>-to-plastics field have spent more than a decade searching for catalysts that can work at close to room temperature and pressure, and coax CO<sub>2</sub> to form a new chemical identity. These efforts fall into two broad categories: chemical and biological conversion.</p>



<h4>First attempts</h4>



<p>Early experiments focused on adding CO<sub>2</sub> to highly reactive monomers like epoxides to facilitate the reaction. Epoxides are three-membered rings composed of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Like a spring under tension, they can easily pop open. In the early 2000s, industrial chemist Christoph Gürtler and chemist Walter Leitner of Aachen University in Germany found a zinc catalyst that allowed them to break open the epoxide ring of polypropylene oxide and combine it with CO<sub>2</sub>. Following the reaction, the CO<sub>2</sub> was joined permanently to the polypropylene molecule and was no longer in gas form — something that is true of all CO<sub>2</sub>-to-plastic reactions. Their work resulted in one of the first commercial CO<sub>2</sub> products — a polyurethane foam containing 20 percent captured CO<sub>2</sub>. Today, the German company Covestro, where Gürtler now works, sells 5,000 tons of the product annually in mattresses, car interiors, building insulation and sports flooring.</p>



<p>More recent research has focused on other monomers to expand the variety of CO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong>-based plastics. Butadiene is a hydrocarbon monomer that can be used to make polyester for clothing, carpets, adhesives and other products.</p>



<p>In 2020, chemist James Eagan at the University of Akron in Ohio mixed butadiene and CO<sub>2</sub> with a series of catalysts developed at Stanford University. Eagan hoped to create a polyester that is carbon negative, meaning it has a net effect of removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, rather than adding it. When he analyzed the contents of one vial, he discovered he had created something even better: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00523">a polyester made with 29 percent CO<sub>2</sub></a> that degrades in high pH water into organic materials.</p>

OF AKRON</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“Chemistry is like cooking,” Eagan says. “We took chocolate chips, flour, eggs, butter, mixed them up, and instead of getting cookies we opened the oven and found a chicken potpie.”</p>



<p>Eagan’s invention has immediate applications in the recycling industry, where machines can often get gummed up from the nondegradable adhesives used in packaging, soda bottle labels and other products. An adhesive that easily breaks down may improve the efficiency of recycling facilities.</p>



<p>Tonks, described by Eagan as a friendly competitor, took Eagan’s patented process a step further. By putting Eagan’s product through one more reaction, Tonks <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355387450_Tunable_and_Recyclable_Polyesters_from_CO2_and_Butadiene">made the polymer fully degradable back to reusable CO<sub>2</sub></a> — a circular carbon economy goal. Tonks created a start-up this year called LoopCO<sub>2</sub> to produce a variety of biodegradable plastics.</p>



<h4>Microbial help</h4>



<p>Researchers have also harnessed microbes to help turn carbon dioxide into useful materials including dress fabric. Some of the planet’s oldest-living microbes emerged at a time when Earth’s atmosphere was rich in carbon dioxide. Known as acetogens and methanogens, the microbes developed simple metabolic pathways that use enzyme catalysts to convert CO<sub>2</sub> and carbon monoxide into organic molecules. In the atmosphere, CO will react with oxygen to form CO<sub>2</sub>. In the last decade, researchers have studied the microbes’ potential to remove these gases from the atmosphere and turn them into useful products.</p>



<p>LanzaTech, based in Skokie, Ill., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717617300319?via%3Dihub">uses the acetogenic bacterium <em>Clostridium autoethanogenum</em> to metabolize CO<sub>2</sub>and CO emissions</a> into a variety of industrial chemicals, including ethanol. Last year, the clothing company Zara began using LanzaTech’s polyester fabric for a line of dresses.</p>



<p>The ethanol used to create these products comes from LanzaTech’s two commercial facilities in China, the first to transform waste CO, a main emission from steel plants, into ethanol. The ethanol goes through two more steps to become polyester. LanzaTech partnered with steel mills near Beijing and in north-central China, feeding carbon monoxide into LanzaTech’s microbe-filled bioreactor.</p>



<p>Steel production emits almost two tons of CO<sub>2</sub> for every ton of steel made. By contrast, a life cycle assessment study found that LanzaTech’s ethanol production process lowered greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 80 percent compared with ethanol made from fossil fuels.</p>



<p>In February, researchers from LanzaTech, Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and others reported in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> that they had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01195-w">genetically modified the <em>Clostridium</em> bacterium to produce acetone and isopropanol</a>, two other fossil fuel–based industrial chemicals. Company CEO Jennifer Holmgren says the only waste product is dead bacteria, which can be used as compost or animal feed.</p>



<p>Other researchers are skipping the living microbes and just using their catalysts. More than a decade ago, chemist Charles Dismukes of Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., began looking at acetogens and methanogens as a way to use atmospheric carbon. He was intrigued by their ability to release energy when making carbon building blocks from CO<sub>2</sub>, a reaction that usually requires energy. He and his team focused on the bacteria’s nickel phosphide catalysts, which are responsible for the energy-releasing carbon reaction.</p>



<p>Dismukes and colleagues <a href="https://chem.rutgers.edu/images/murali/publications/27_EnergyEnviSci.pdf">developed six electrocatalysts</a> that are able to make monomers at room temperature and pressure using only CO<sub>2</sub>, water and electricity. The energy­-releasing pathway of the nickel phosphide catalysts “lowers the required voltage to run the reaction, which lowers the energy consumption of the process and improves the carbon footprint,” says Karin Calvinho, a former student of Dismukes who is now chief technical officer at RenewCO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong>, the start-up Dismukes’ team formed in 2018.</p>



<p>RenewCO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong> plans to sell its monomers, including monoethylene glycol, to companies that want to reduce their carbon footprint. The group proved its concept works using CO<sub>2</sub> brought into the lab. In the future, the company intends to obtain CO<sub>2</sub> from biomass, industrial emissions or direct air capture.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Bacteria business&nbsp; </h3>



<p>LanzaTech genetically modifies bacteria to&nbsp;transform carbon dioxide into ethanol and other building blocks for plastics and other&nbsp;products. RenewCO<sub>2</sub> uses nickel-based&nbsp;catalysts inspired by bacteria to do the same — break down CO<sub>2</sub> using little energy to make new things.</p>

<h4>Barriers to change</h4>



<p>Yet researchers and companies face challenges in scaling up carbon capture and reuse. Some barriers lurk in the language of regulations written before CCU existed. An example is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s program to provide tax credits to companies that make biofuels. The program is geared toward plant-based fuels like corn and sugar­cane. LanzaTech’s approach for making jet fuel doesn’t qualify for credits because bacteria are not plants.</p>



<p>Other barriers are more fundamental. Styring points to the long-standing practice of fossil fuel subsidies, which in 2021 topped $440 billion worldwide. Global government subsidies to the oil and gas industry <a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/energy-subsidies">keep fossil fuel prices artificially low</a>, making it hard for renewables to compete, according to the International Energy Agency. Styring advocates shifting those subsidies toward renewables.</p>



<p>“We try to work on the principle that we recycle carbon and create a circular economy,” he says. “But current legislation is set up to perpetuate a linear economy.”</p>

<p>As companies try to reduce their carbon footprint, many are doing life cycle assessments to quantify the full carbon cost of their products.</p>
</div>



<p>The happy morning routine that makes the world carbon cleaner is theoretically possible. It’s just not the way the world works yet. Getting to that circular economy, where the amount of carbon above ground is finite and controlled in a never-ending loop of use and reuse will require change on multiple fronts. Government policy and investment, corporate practices, technological development and human behavior would need to align perfectly and quickly in the interests of the planet.</p>



<p>In the meantime, researchers continue their work on the carbon dioxide molecule.</p>



<p>“I try to plan for the worst-case scenario,” says Eagan, the chemist in Akron. “If legislation is never in place to curb emissions, how do we operate within our capitalist system to generate value in a renewable and responsible way? At the end of the day, we will need new chemistry.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/donkey-domestication-dna-east-africa">DNA reveals donkeys were domesticated 7,000 years ago in East Africa</a></h4>

              
                <p>From pulling Mesopotamian war chariots to grinding grain in the Middle Ages, donkeys have carried civilization on their backs for centuries. DNA has now revealed just how ancient humans’ relationship with donkeys really is.</p>



<p>The genetic instruction books of over 200 donkeys from countries around the world show that these beasts of burden <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo3503">were domesticated about 7,000 years ago in East Africa</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“The history of the donkey has puzzled scientists for years,” says Ludovic Orlando, a molecular archaeologist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France. This discovery shows that donkeys were domesticated in one fell swoop, roughly 3,000 years before horses.</p>





<p>DNA has great potential for unraveling humankind’s shared history with our animal companions. In 2021, Orlando and his colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">used DNA from the bones of horses</a> to track their domestication to the Eurasian steppes, in what’s now southwestern Russia, more than 4,200 years ago (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>But the history of donkeys (<em>Equus asinus</em>) had remained murky. Today, domesticated donkeys are found all over the globe. A dwindling number of wild asses in Asia and Africa — the closest wild relatives of donkeys — pointed toward one of those continents as the likely donkey homeland.</p>



<p>Archaeological evidence — including a 5,000-year-old Egyptian tablet depicting marching asses, sheep and cattle — zeroed in on Africa as the most probable contender. But genetic studies attempting to pin down when and where donkeys were domesticated have been largely inconclusive.</p>



<p>This was probably because scientists were lacking donkey DNA from many regions of the world, Orlando says. For example, to date, there have been no published genomes from donkeys living south of the equator in Africa. To get a broader diversity of DNA, Orlando and his colleagues gathered 207 genomes from donkeys living in 31 countries, ranging from Brazil to China, along with DNA belonging to 31 donkeys that lived between 4,000 and about 100 years ago.</p>



<p>By comparing these genomes with those of wild asses, the researchers found that all donkeys could trace their lineage back to a single domestication event in East Africa, perhaps in the Horn of Africa, around 5000 B.C. From there, domesticated donkeys spread to the rest of the continent and into Europe and Asia, where they formed genetically distinct groups based on region. Humans have now brought donkeys to nearly every continent on Earth, carrying their genetic legacy with them. </p>



<p>These results add new clarity to the story of donkey domestication, says Emily Clark, a livestock geneticist at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh. “Donkeys are extraordinary working animals that are essential to the livelihoods of millions of people around the globe,” she says. “As humans, we owe a debt of gratitude to the domestic donkey for the role they play and have played in shaping society.”</p>

Here, a donkey carries a rider across sands in Sudan.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117021">Emmanuelle Vila</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Exactly why people chose to tame wild asses in Africa thousands of years ago is unclear. But the timing of their first spread across eastern Africa coincides with a period when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/little-drier-every-day">Sahara started becoming more arid</a> and expanded (<em>SN: 5/8/08</em>).</p>



<p>“Donkeys are champions when it comes to carrying stuff and are good at going through deserts,” Orlando says. As the desert grew larger, donkeys could have provided much needed help moving goods across the increasingly dry terrain, he says.</p>



<p>The archaeological record for donkeys in Africa outside of Egypt is sparse. The new result could help archaeologists narrow their search to new areas to learn more about the first donkeys and the people who tamed them, Orlando says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, digging into the genetic diversity that has allowed donkeys to support human endeavors across a range of environmental conditions could put donkeys in the spotlight as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change exacerbates droughts</a> and threatens to expand deserts around the world (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Donkeys still provide tons of support for people living in low- and middle-income countries,” Orlando says. Understanding humankind’s shared history with donkeys “is not just about the past, but could actually be useful in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-speech-brain-activity-accuracy">An AI can decode speech from brain activity with surprising accuracy</a></h4>

              
                <p>An artificial intelligence can decode words and sentences from brain activity with surprising — but still limited — accuracy. Using only a few seconds of brain activity data, the AI guesses what a person has heard. It lists the correct answer in its top 10 possibilities up to 73 percent of the time, researchers found in a preliminary study.</p>



<p>The AI’s “performance was above what many people thought was possible at this stage,” says Giovanni Di Liberto, a computer scientist at Trinity College Dublin who was not involved in the research.</p>





<p>Developed at the parent company of Facebook, Meta, the AI could eventually be used to help thousands of people around the world <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12266">unable to communicate through speech, typing or gestures</a>, researchers report August 25 at arXiv.org. That includes many patients in minimally conscious, locked-in or “vegetative states” — what’s now generally known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-scans-decode-elusive-signature-consciousness">unresponsive wakefulness syndrome</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/19</em>).</p>



<p>Most existing technologies to help such patients communicate require risky brain surgeries to implant electrodes. This new approach &#8220;could provide a viable path to help patients with communication deficits … without the use of invasive methods,” says neuroscientist Jean-Rémi King, a Meta AI researcher currently at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.</p>



<p>King and his colleagues trained a computational tool to detect words and sentences on 56,000 hours of speech recordings from 53 languages. The tool, also known as a language model, learned how to recognize specific features of language both at a fine-grained level — think letters or syllables — and at a broader level, such as a word or sentence.</p>



<p>The team applied an AI with this language model to databases from four institutions that included brain activity from 169 volunteers. In these databases, participants listened to various stories and sentences from, for example, Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> and Lewis Carroll’s <em>Alice</em>’<em>s Adventures in Wonderland</em> while the people’s brains were scanned using either magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography. Those techniques measure the magnetic or electrical component of brain signals.</p>



<p>Then with the help of a computational method that helps account for physical differences among actual brains, the team tried to decode what participants had heard using just three seconds of brain activity data from each person. The team instructed the AI to align the speech sounds from the story recordings to patterns of brain activity that the AI computed as corresponding to what people were hearing. It then made predictions about what the person might have been hearing during that short time, given more than 1,000 possibilities.</p>



<p>Using magnetoencephalography, or MEG, the correct answer was in the AI’s top 10 guesses up to 73 percent of the time, the researchers found. With electroencephalography, that value dropped to no more than 30 percent. “[That MEG] performance is very good,” Di Liberto says, but he’s less optimistic about its practical use. “What can we do with it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”</p>



<p>The reason, he says, is that MEG requires a bulky and expensive machine. Bringing this technology to clinics will require scientific innovations that make the machines cheaper and easier to use.</p>



<p>It’s also important to understand what “decoding” really means in this study, says Jonathan Brennan, a linguist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The word is often used to describe the process of deciphering information directly from a source — in this case, speech from brain activity. But the AI could do this only because it was provided a finite list of possible correct answers to make its guesses.</p>



<p>“With language, that’s not going to cut it if we want to scale to practical use, because language is infinite,” Brennan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, Di Liberto says, the AI decoded information of participants passively listening to audio, which is not directly relevant to nonverbal patients. For it to become a meaningful communication tool, scientists will need to learn how to decrypt from brain activity what these patients intend on saying, including expressions of hunger, discomfort or a simple “yes” or “no.”</p>



<p>The new study is &#8220;decoding of speech perception, not production,” King agrees. Though speech production is the ultimate goal, for now, “we’re quite a long way away.”</p>

                <p>Recently published findings in <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> have found that the risk of children being orphaned per COVID-19 death is highest in the poorest countries and those where people of reproductive age have the highest rates of non-communicable diseases. To learn more about these findings from Callum Lowe of Australian National University and colleagues, read our Research Highlight summary below, or access the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Background and Study Design</strong></p>



<p>Due to the higher COVID-19 mortality risk among adults than children, and the propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to quickly spread throughout a household, there is the possibility that children will survive a COVID-19 infection while their parents or caregivers will not. In this study, the researchers used a previously developed COVID-19 orphanhood calculator to predict the total orphans per COVID-19 death for 139 countries. The calculator integrated information on fertility rates and pandemic mortality by age and sex. Information on other factors, including vaccine coverage and sociodemographics was also available at the country level.</p>



<p><strong>Results and Insights</strong></p>

<p>The team found that the risk of orphaned children (those who have lost at least one of their parents or caregivers) was much higher in countries below median GDP per capita (1.56 orphans per COVID-19 death) compared to countries above median GDP (0.09 orphans per death). The increased risk of orphans was specifically associated with greater poverty prevalence (B = 2.32, p&lt;0.01), lower GDP per capita (B = -0.23, p&lt;0.05), and a higher proportion of people with non-communicative diseases who are between the ages of 15 and 49 (B = 1.46, p&lt;0.0001). In almost all global regions, it was also associated with lower vaccination coverage.</p>



<p>The authors conclude that due to pre-existing health and vaccine coverage inequity, more children will suffer the loss of their parents due to COVID-19 in poorer countries.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;COVID-19 has spread to almost every country on the globe, but the risk of children being orphaned due to COVID-19 is higher in poorer countries. Inequity in access to COVID-19 vaccines will bolster this issue further.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-long-term-imprint-health">How the COVID-19 pandemic may leave a long-term imprint on our health</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the start of another school year, I’ve been thinking about the differences between 2021 and 2022. Last year, many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">schools had mask mandates</a>, testing programs and quarantine rules <em>(SN: 3/15/22</em>). This year,<a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/8/4/23291946/mask-mandates-fall-2022-school-year"> masking is optional</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">testing and quarantines are out</a> (<em>SN: 8/19/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve shed measures that<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1"> stop the spread of the coronavirus</a> and help<a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/5/e2021055727/184750/A-Test-to-Stay-Modified-Quarantine-Program-for"> prevent excessive disruptions to in-person learning</a>. Without them, and with the absence of nearly any controls in place elsewhere in society, we’re inviting the virus to keep spreading, to find new ways to thwart immunity and to continue to derail plans and routines. And it’s not just a risk to our day-to-day lives, but to our future health. As much as we want to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror, evidence continues to emerge that the coronavirus’s impact will be a recurring, unwelcome feature of many tomorrows.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists predict COVID-19 cases will rise this fall and winter in the United States, as more of life heads indoors during colder weather. The Biden Administration has said there could be 100 million new cases. We have a new aid in the face of a possible surge: a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">revamped COVID-19 shot targeting the omicron variant</a>, from both Pfizer (for 12 years and up) and Moderna (for 18 years and up), is now available (<em>SN: 9/2/22</em>). Meant as a booster shot, the tweaked vaccine is the original version with added protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. The BA.5 variant is dominant in the United States, accounting for <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">89 percent of cases</a> at the beginning of September.</p>

<p>Public health officials would like to get as many boosters in arms as possible this fall to temper a rise in cases. We know the original vaccine has done an outstanding job <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2206573">protecting people from severe illness and death</a>. The vaccine has also <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2792598">helped reduced transmission</a>, although this benefit <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2116597">can wane quickly</a>. Overall, the COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial tool to protect public health. But it alone can’t shoulder the entire burden of keeping the virus at bay. Controlling the coronavirus takes a team approach, the vaccine together with masks,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-covid-normal-air-quality-clean-indoor"> ventilation improvements</a> and crowd control (<em>SN: 4/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>Without these additional measures, people will keep getting sick. Claire Taylor, a physician in the United Kingdom, tweeted about <a href="https://twitter.com/drclairetaylor/status/1564349214418735106">her experience having COVID-19 three times this year</a>, in March, June and August, as the omicron family of variants moved through her country. “How can it be sustainable, sensible, bearable even, to get a virus that floors you in the same way multiple times a year?” she wrote.</p>



<p>It doesn’t seem sustainable, sensible or bearable. Not with what the virus can do in the midst of infection, and not with the harms that can linger after an infection subsides. Adults, for example, can face health issues throughout the body after a bout of COVID-19. A study of health records from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs reported that, compared with those who haven’t had COVID-19, those who have — whether hospitalized or not — face<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8938267/"> higher risks of a variety of cardiovascular diseases</a> beyond the initial 30 days post-infection. Other research has found an<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00260-7/fulltext"> increased risk of neurological and psychiatric illnesses</a> for two years after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with other respiratory infections.</p>





<p>On top of the risks from COVID-19 itself is the expected health effects of the pandemic’s disruptions to medical care. A study of a large health care system in Massachusetts found a<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250561/"> drop in expected hospitalizations for urgent heart issues</a> during the first year of the pandemic. Breast and ovarian<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2792956"> cancer screenings in the United States </a>decreased in 2020 compared with 2018. These delayed and lost health care opportunities may reverberate for years.</p>



<p>And then there is long COVID. Each surge of infections adds to the pool of people suffering from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">range of debilitating symptoms</a> that they just can’t shake, from extreme fatigue to brain fog to shortness of breath (<em>SN: 9/1/22</em>). Because it takes time to identify people who develop long COVID, we don’t yet know the toll from the omicron surge earlier this year. But the spike in cases was so large, “I suspect there will be millions of people who acquire <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/long-covid-omicron-reinfections-vaccines/">long COVID after omicron infection</a>,” immunobiologist Akiko Iwasaki told Liz Szabo of <em>Kaiser Health News</em> on August 26.</p>



<p>Long COVID can leave people unable to work, which is a threat to their ability to support themselves and maintain health insurance, as well as a looming crisis for the economy. There are already an estimated 16.3 million working-age Americans, meaning those 18 to 65 years old, who have long COVID; <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-data-shows-long-covid-is-keeping-as-many-as-4-million-people-out-of-work/">2 million to 4 million of them are out of work because of their illness</a>, a new Brookings Metro report finds. The annual cost of the wages lost is around $170 billion and may be as high as $230 billion.</p>



<p>There are<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1832196"> also health</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384441/"> impacts</a> from grieving the<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic#the-aftermath"> loss of so many lives during the pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). Already <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125462">1 million people have died worldwide this year</a> from COVID-19; close to <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">6.5 million in total</a> have lost their lives to the disease during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Those deaths have included a devastating number of children’s parents and caregivers. Approximately <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2795650">7.5 million children have lost one or both parents</a> to COVID-19 as of May 2022, researchers report in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> on September 6. An estimated 10.5 million children have become orphans or lost caregivers. These deaths <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-children-parent-caregiver-loss-death-5-million">put children’s education, health and well-being at risk</a>, deficits that cannot be overcome without dedicated societal support (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like adults, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7131a3.htm">children who’ve had COVID-19 are at higher risk for various health issues</a> compared with children who haven’t had the illness, including heart inflammation and blood clots, researchers reported in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> on August 5. Children also <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Long-Haul-COVID-19-in-Children-and-Teens.aspx">develop long COVID</a>. And kids and teens have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445752/">suffered mental health harms</a> from the pandemic, with many experiencing increased anxiety and depression. The<a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/01/special-childrens-mental-health"> subsequent demand for mental health services</a> hasn’t been met.</p>



<p>We’re just beginning to learn about other health issues that could stem from the virus or the circumstances of the pandemic. A recent U.S. study found an alarming rise in youth-onset type 2 diabetes during the first year of the pandemic compared with the average of the prior two years. New cases<a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(22)00719-3/fulltext"> jumped by 77 percent</a> in 2020. It’s not clear if the increase is due to COVID-19 infection, shifts in diet or activity or stressors from the pandemic, but the rise has strained existing health services for children with diabetes, the researchers wrote.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>The pandemic has also disrupted vital health services for children around the world. A study of 18 low- and lower-middle–income countries found a decline in doctor visits and the delivery of maternal and child health care from March 2020 to June 2021. The lost care is estimated to have led to more than 110,000 excess deaths among children under 5 and more than 3,000 excess deaths among mothers, a<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004070"> threat to recent progress in reducing child and maternal mortality</a>, researchers report August 30 in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. The pandemic has also<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00512-X/fulltext"> interfered with vaccination campaigns</a>, leaving children worldwide vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>



<p>Even newborns may face worsened health as a result of the pandemic. Research on prenatal exposures to maternal infection during the 1918 influenza pandemic has found health issues much later in life for the babies born, including higher rates of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826837/">cardiovascular disease</a>, kidney disease and diabetes.</p>



<p>In a piece on<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2782147"> why studies across the life span of children</a> born to mothers who’ve had COVID-19 are needed, the authors discuss the hypothesis that maternal infections during different trimesters may put the fetal organs developing at the time at risk. For example, the heart develops in the first trimester, the kidneys in the third, so infections in those periods could mean a higher risk later in life of cardiovascular disease or kidney disease, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just a preview of the pandemic’s reach; we’re going to continue to learn of ways COVID-19 will shape our health and our lives going forward. It’s enough to keep me in a mask, and though reasons for donning one undoubtedly vary, I’m far from alone: <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/cg45193g4z/econTabReport.pdf">31 percent of Americans are masking most or all of the time</a>, while 26 percent are some of the time, according to a poll from late August by <em>The Economist</em>/YouGov.</p>



<p>Considering what we know so far, and with an expected rise in COVID-19 cases on the horizon, reinstating masking and implementing other control measures indoors in the coming months seems prudent. It’s a guard against infections now and may contribute to a healthier tomorrow.</p>

<h4>Biggest bacteria?</h4>



<p><em>A newfound species of bacteria, </em>Thiomargarita magnifica<em>, averages 1 centimeter long and can be seen by the naked eye, making it the largest bacteria yet discovered, <strong>Erin Garcia de Jesús</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-eukaryote-thiomargarita-magnifica-namibiensis-largest-bacterium">Newfound bacteria make a big splash</a>” (</em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 17<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>J.C. Smith</strong> pointed out that another article in the magazine seems to contradict the findings in this story. In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrical-bacteria-may-help-clean-oil-spills-and-curb-methane-emissions">Live wires</a>,” <strong>Nikk Ogasa</strong> reported that cable bacteria, which channel electricity, can grow up to 5 centimeters long (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 24</em>).</p>





<p>This is no contradiction, <strong>Garcia de Jesús</strong> says. <em>T. magnifica</em> is a single-celled species of bacteria, which means all of the cellular functions necessary for the organism’s survival happen within its one cell. Cable bacteria, on the other hand, are multicellular, with different cells performing different functions. “<em>T. magnifica</em> is the largest single-celled bacterium ever found,” <strong>Garcia de Jesús</strong> says.</p>



<p>Given that bacteria are typically defined as single-celled organisms, reader <strong>Barry Maletzky</strong> wondered how multicellular cable bacteria can be considered part of the group.</p>



<p>Most bacteria are single-celled, <strong>Ogasa</strong> says, but several multicellular species do exist. “For instance, some cyanobacteria, sometimes called blue-green algae, are also multicellular. That allows the organisms to split the jobs of photosynthesis and nitrogen absorption between cells.”</p>



<h4>Mapping out space</h4>



<p><em>Massive objects that warp spacetime can redirect gravitational waves. Researchers might someday leverage those waves as a kind of gravity “radar” to peer inside stars and find globs of dark matter, <strong>Asa Stahl</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-radar-map-invisible-universe-spacetime-dark-matter">Gravitational wave ‘radar’ could map the universe</a>” (</em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Neil Kaminar</strong> wondered if changes in the frequency of light coming from massive objects could be used to detect the distortion of spacetime.</p>



<p>In theory, yes, says <strong>Glenn Starkman</strong>, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. When light travels through spacetime toward or away from a massive object, gravity changes the frequency of the light, he says. Scientists have witnessed one form of this process, called gravitational redshift, in action on Earth.</p>



<p>But this effect would probably not be very useful when it comes to gravitational radar, <strong>Starkman</strong> says. After light moves toward a massive object, changing its frequency, it would then move away from the object. That process would shift the light’s frequency toward what it was before the encounter, mostly canceling out the effect, <strong>Starkman</strong> says.</p>



<h4>Science and society</h4>



<p><em>In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covering-politicized-science">We won’t shy away from covering politicized science</a>,” editor in chief <strong>Nancy Shute</strong> reflected on </em>Science News<em>’ history of reporting on the science of politically contentious issues and asserted our commitment to continue that coverage (</em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 2<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Brigitte Dempsey </strong>was glad to read <strong>Shute’s</strong> editor’s note in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that had protected a person’s right to an abortion. Since then, debates around abortion and pregnancy biology have become more heated, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling">accurate science is often missing from the discussions</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 6</em>). “Bravo for meeting the issue square on,” <strong>Dempsey</strong> wrote. “Our only hope to bring reason to bear … is to let science speak.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-placenta-fossil-manbearbig-fast-lifestyle">Living fast may have helped mammals like ‘ManBearPig’ dominate</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the wake of the dinosaurs’ demise, a bizarre beast that some researchers have nicknamed “ManBearPig” lived life in the fast lane. This sheep-sized mammal — which sported five-fingered hands, a bearlike face and the stocky build of a pig — gave birth to highly developed young. And those young grew up much faster than expected for an animal as massive as ManBearPig, new fossil analyses show.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05150-w">combination of long gestation and quick aging</a> may have led to many rapid generations of bigger and bigger babies, researchers report online August 31 in <em>Nature</em>. Such an approach to life could help explain how some mammals took over the world after the dinosaur doomsday.</p>





<p>During the age of the dinosaurs, mammals “only got as large as a domestic cat, maybe, or a badger,” says Gregory Funston, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. But after an asteroid wiped out all nonbird dinosaurs about 66 million years ago, “we see this huge explosion in mammal diversity, where mammals start to get really big,” Funston says.</p>



<p>In particular, placental mammals got really big. Those are mammals whose babies develop mainly in the womb while fed by a placenta — unlike egg-laying platypuses or marsupials, whose tiny newborns do much of their development in their mother’s pouch. Today, placentals are the most diverse group of mammals and include some of the world’s largest animals such as whales, elephants and giraffes.</p>



<p>Paleontologists have long wondered why placentals rose to dominance. Researchers suspected that the long gestation period of this mammal lineage was an important factor. But it was unclear how long ago such long gestation evolved.</p>



<p>For clues, Funston and colleagues turned to what they call ManBearPig, or <em>Pantolambda bathmodon</em>. This ancient herbivore, which lived about 62 million years ago, was one of the first large mammals to appear after the dinosaur apocalypse. The team examined fossils from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, including two partial skeletons and scattered teeth from several other individuals.</p>



<p>Daily and annual growth lines in the teeth sketched out a timeline of each animal’s life. On that timeline, chemical signatures recorded when the creature underwent major life changes. The physical stress of being born left a deposit of zinc on the tooth enamel. Barium in the enamel spiked while an animal was nursing. Other details of the teeth and bones revealed how fast <em>P. bathmodon</em> grew throughout its life and each animal’s age at death.</p>

This mark has helped researchers determine how long <em>P. bathmodon </em>developed in the womb.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116921">G. Funston</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p><em>P. bathmodon</em> stayed in the womb for about seven months, nursed for just a month or two, reached adulthood within a year and lived at most about 11 years, the team found. A female’s pregnancy was much longer than the weeks-long gestation seen in modern marsupials and platypuses, but similar to the months-long pregnancies typical of modern placentals.</p>



<p>“It was reproducing like the most extreme placentals do today,” Funston says, such as giraffes and wildebeests — which are on their feet within minutes of birth. <em>P. bathmodon </em>gave birth to “probably just one baby in each litter, and that baby had a full set of teeth already in the mouth when it was born, and that means it was probably born with fur in place and with open eyes.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="537" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/090122_mt_fast-aging-mammal_inline1-537x450.jpg" alt="photo of a P. bathmodon skull taken from below, showing its teeth in focus" class="wp-image-3116920" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/090122_mt_fast-aging-mammal_inline1-537x450.jpg 537w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/090122_mt_fast-aging-mammal_inline1-457x383.jpg 457w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/090122_mt_fast-aging-mammal_inline1-222x186.jpg 222w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/090122_mt_fast-aging-mammal_inline1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116920">This photograph of a <em>P. bathmodon </em>skull reveals its teeth, which had sharp ridges and grooves for chewing plants.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116920">G. Funston</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The rest of <em>P. bathmodon</em>’s life trajectory, however, was markedly different from modern mammals. This species weaned and reached adulthood faster than expected for an animal of its size. Most died between two and five years old, with the oldest one studied dead at age 11 — only about half of the 20-year lifespan expected for an animal as big as ManBearPig.</p>



<p>That “live fast, die young” lifestyle may have helped placental mammals fill giant dinos’ empty shoes, says Graham Slater, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the study. “These things are going to be kicking out new generations every year and a half,” he says, “and because they’re having that rapid generation time … evolution can just act faster.”</p>



<p>Longer gestation could have led to bigger babies, which grew into bigger adults that had bigger babies themselves. With many such generations passing in quick succession, Slater says, “you’re going to get bigger and bigger animals very, very quickly.”</p>



<p>But no single species can tell the story of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-world-evolution-innovation-dinosaurs-paleontology">how mammals took over the world</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/22</em>). Future studies should investigate whether other mammals that lived around this time had a similar life cycle, Slater says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amputation-surgery-oldest-fossil-borneo">The oldest known surgical amputation occurred 31,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A child who lived on the Indonesian island of Borneo around 31,000 years ago underwent the oldest known surgical operation, an amputation of the lower left leg, researchers say.</p>



<p>One or more hunter-gatherers who performed the operation possessed detailed knowledge of human anatomy and considerable technical skill, enabling the youngster to avoid fatal blood loss and infection, say archaeologist Tim Maloney of Griffith University in Southport, Australia, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Healed bone <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05160-8">where the lower leg was amputated</a> indicates that the ancient youth survived for at least six to nine years after surgery before dying at age 19 or 20, the investigators report September 7 in <em>Nature</em>. Since there is no evidence of crushing from an accident or an animal’s bite at the amputation site, the researchers suspect that an unidentified medical problem led to the operation.</p>





<p>Maloney’s team excavated this individual’s remains in 2020 from a grave inside a large, three-chambered cave. Radiocarbon dating of burned bits of wood just below the grave along with another dating technique on a tooth from the youth’s lower jaw let the researchers estimate when the surgery took place.</p>



<p>Until now, the oldest known amputation involved <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2007.1278.1">a farmer from France whose left forearm was surgically removed nearly 7,000 years ago</a>. In North Africa, surgeries to create <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-surgery-oldest-north-america-forehead-brain">skull openings may have occurred as early as 13,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>).</p>



<p>Faced with rapid wound infections in a tropical region, ancient people on Borneo developed antiseptic treatments from local plants, Maloney’s group suspects. It’s unknown what type of tool was used in the Stone Age operation or whether the patient was sedated with a plant-based concoction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-domestication-origin-mythology-history">How mythology could help demystify dog domestication</a></h4>

              
                <p>In <em>Tom Edison’s Shaggy Dog</em>, a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Edison discovers that dogs are intellectually superior beings. They’re so smart, in fact, that the canines found the easiest possible way to survive: endearing themselves to humans. When Edison confronts his own dog about this revelation, the dog says, “Look, Mr. Edison. Why not keep quiet about this? It’s been working out to everybody’s satisfaction for hundreds of thousands of years. Let sleeping dogs lie.”</p>



<p>It’s true that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-domestication-happened-just-once-ancient-dna-study-suggests">humankind’s close relationship with canines</a> spans millennia (<em>SN: 7/18/17</em>). This long-term interspecies friendship is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">a topic of intense scientific study</a>, though where, when and even why it began remains murky (<em>SN: 7/6/17)</em>. Short a talking dog, scientists have had to rely on archaeological and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-tells-two-origins-dogs">genetic evidence</a> for clues (<em>SN: 6/2/16</em>). But the similarities between wolves and early domesticated dogs can make it challenging for researchers to tell them apart. In the earliest days, before wolves were fully domesticated, perhaps the most notable difference is simply the animals’ involvement with people.</p>





<p>That’s where storytelling can help, says historian Julien d’Huy of the College of France in Paris. Our penchant for mythologizing canine companions may be just as ancient as our relationship with them, so d’Huy is turning to these stories in a bid to shed more light on the history of dog domestication.<br><br>Some historians argue that using mythology to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/no-fairy-tale-origins-some-famous-stories-go-back-thousands-years">track human migration and the spread of information</a> is unreliable because stories change quickly (<em>SN: 1/19/16</em>). D’Huy disagrees: Dogs play a starring role in many cultural origin stories, and since these myths are central to identity, that gives them stability over time, he says.</p>



<p>“With mythology, we can have explanations of archaeology, we can have reasons for domestication, we can test hypotheses,” he says.</p>

<p>D’Huy found three core storylines for the earliest myths related to dogs: The first links dogs with the afterlife, the second relates to the union of humans and dogs, and the third associates a dog with the star Sirius. Versions of these stories are found in many cultural regions around the world. He then borrowed statistical tools from biology to create family trees of myths, showing how the stories evolved as they followed humans from one region of the world to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Folktales about dogs <a href="https://doi.org/10.5252/anthropozoologica2022v57a7">stemmed from Central and Eastern Asia</a> and spread to Europe, the Americas and later Australia and Africa, d’Huy reports in the June <em>Anthropozoologica</em>. This mythological travel route parallels a proposed path of dog domestication borne out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dog-fossil-domestication-human-path-americas-migration">by genetic and fossil</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dog-fossil-domestication-human-path-americas-migration"> evidence</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>“This was a surprise,” d’Huy says. He wasn’t sure if dogs and our mythology about them would migrate together.<br><br>“It is certainly arguable that dogs were first domesticated in Asia,” says Pat Shipman, a retired paleoanthropologist and author of <em>Our Oldest Companions: The Story of the First Dogs.</em> Using mythology is a clever way to peer into the past, she says, because it can provide insight into how ancient humans valued dogs.</p>



<p>The prevalence of ancient myths identifying dogs as guides to the afterlife hint that our ancestors initially domesticated wolves not for hunting partners, as commonly believed, but for spiritual and symbolic reasons, d’Huy argues. This hypothesis fits with certain archaeological finds, he says, such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440318300049?via%3Dihub">a 14,000-year-old grave in Germany</a> containing a couple and two dogs. The woman was found with her hand resting on one of the dogs’ heads.</p>



<p>D’Huy is applying these methods to study how ancient myths can inform what we know about our connection with other animals such as sheep — their mythological link with the sun could have led to domestication. Symbolic, rather than utilitarian, reasons for domestication could explain a lot of data, he says.</p>



<p>“Comparative mythology has something to say in the world of research,” he says. “Something very precious to say, I think.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-pollution-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-ocean">A coral pollution study unexpectedly helped explain Hurricane Maria’s fury</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico early on September 20, 2017, with 250-kilometer-per-hour winds, torrential rains and a storm surge up to three meters high. In its wake: nearly 3,000 people dead, an almost yearlong power outage and over $90 billion in damages to homes, businesses and essential infrastructure, including roads and bridges.</p>



<p>Geologist and diver Milton Carlo took shelter at his house in Cabo Rojo on the southwest corner of the island with his wife, daughter and infant grandson. He watched the raging winds of the Category 4 hurricane lift his neighbor’s SUV into the air, and remembers those hours as some of the worst of his life.</p>





<p>For weeks, the rest of the world was in the dark about the full extent of the devastation, because Maria had destroyed the island’s main weather radar and almost all cell phone towers.</p>



<p>Far away on the U.S. West Coast, in Santa Cruz, Calif., oceanographer Olivia Cheriton watched satellite radar images of Maria passing over the instruments she and her U.S. Geological Survey team had anchored a few kilometers southwest of Puerto Rico. The instruments, placed offshore from the seaside town of La Parguera, were there to track pollution circulating around some of the island’s endangered corals.</p>



<p>More than half a year went by before she learned the improbable fate of those instruments: They had survived <em>and</em> had captured data revealing hurricane-related ocean dynamics that no scientist had ever recorded.</p>



<p>The wind-driven coastal currents interacted with the seafloor in a way that prevented Maria from drawing cold water from the depths of the sea up to the surface. The sea surface stayed as warm as bathwater. Heat is a hurricane’s fuel source, so a warmer sea surface leads to a more intense storm. As Cheriton figured out later, the phenomenon she stumbled upon likely played a role in maintaining Maria’s Category 4 status as it raked Puerto Rico for eight hours.</p>



<p>“There was absolutely no plan to capture the impact of a storm like Maria,” Cheriton says. “In fact, if we somehow could’ve known that a storm like that was going to occur, we wouldn’t have put hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of scientific instrumentation in the water.”</p>



<p>A storm’s path is guided by readily observable, large-scale atmospheric features such as trade winds and high-pressure zones. Its intensity, on the other hand, is driven by weather events inside the hurricane and wave action deep below the ocean’s surface. The findings by Cheriton and colleagues, published May 2021 in <em>Science Advances</em>, help explain <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf1552">why hurricanes often get stronger before making landfall </a>and can therefore help forecasters make more accurate predictions.</p>



<h4>Reef pollution</h4>



<p>Cheriton’s original research objective was to figure out how sea currents transport polluted sediments from Guánica Bay — where the Lajas Valley drains into the Caribbean Sea — to the pristine marine ecosystems 10 kilometers west in La Parguera Natural Reserve, famous for its bioluminescent waters.</p>



<p>Endangered elkhorn and mountainous star corals, called “the poster children of Caribbean reef decline” by marine geologist Clark Sherman, live near shore in some of the world’s highest recorded concentrations of now-banned industrial chemicals. Those polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, hinder coral reproduction, growth, feeding and defensive responses, says Sherman, of the University of Puerto Rico–Mayagüez.</p>

<p>Half of corals in the Caribbean have died since monitoring began in the 1970s, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax9395">pollution is a major cause</a>, according to an April 2020 study in <em>Science Advances</em>. Of particular interest to Cheriton, Sherman and their colleagues was whether the pollution had reached deepwater, or mesophotic, reefs farther offshore, which could be a refuge for coral species that were known to be dying in shallower areas.</p>



<p>The main artery for this pollution is the Rio Loco — which translates to “Crazy River.” It spews a toxic runoff of eroded sediments from the Lajas Valley’s <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/NOS/OCM/Projects/397/ViqueiraRios2018_Guanica_Watershed_Management_Implementation.pdf">dirt roads</a> and coffee plantations into Guánica Bay, which supports a vibrant fishing community. Other possible contributors to the pollution — oil spills, a fertilizer plant, sewage and now-defunct sugar mills — are the subject of investigations by public health researchers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>



<p>In June 2017, the team convened in La Parguera to install underwater sensors to measure and track the currents in this threatened marine environment. From Sherman’s lab on a tiny islet overrun with iguanas the size of house cats, he and Cheriton, along with team leader and USGS research geologist Curt Storlazzi and USGS physical scientist Joshua Logan, launched a boat into choppy seas.</p>

<p>At six sites near shore, Storlazzi, Sherman and Logan dove to the seafloor and used epoxy to anchor pressure gauges and batonlike current meters. Together the instruments measured hourly temperature, wave height and current speed. The team then moved farther offshore where the steep island shelf drops off at a 45-degree angle to a depth of 60 meters, but the heavy ocean chop scuttled their efforts to install instruments there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="482" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline3.jpg" alt="Photo of Curt Storlazzi (left) and Joshua Logan (right) wearing scuba gear and sitting next to each other on the side of a boat in the ocean" class="wp-image-3116711" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline3-540x383.jpg 540w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline3-635x450.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline3-262x186.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116711">In June 2017, research geologist Curt Storlazzi (left) and physical scientist Joshua Logan (right) prepare to dive near Puerto Rico’s Guánica Bay to install instruments for monitoring currents suspected of delivering pollution to coral reefs.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116711">USGS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For help working in the difficult conditions, Sherman enlisted two expert divers for a second attempt: Carlo, the geologist and diving safety officer, and marine scientist Evan Tuohy, both of the University of Puerto Rico–­Mayagüez. The two were able to install the most important and largest piece, a hydroacoustic instrument comprising several drums fastened to a metal grid, which tracked the direction and speed of currents every minute using pulsating sound waves. A canister containing temperature and salinity sensors took readings every two minutes. Above this equipment, an electric thermometer extended to within 12 meters of the surface, registering temperature every five meters vertically every few seconds.</p>

<p>Working in concert, the instruments gave a high-resolution, seafloor-to-surface snapshot of the ocean’s hydrodynamics on a near-continuous basis. The equipment had to sit level on the sloping seafloor so as not to skew the measurements and remain firmly in place. Little did the researchers know that the instruments would soon be battered by one of the most destructive storms in history.</p>

<h4>Becoming Maria</h4>



<p>The word hurricane derives from the Caribbean Taino people’s <em>Huricán</em>, god of evil. Some of the strongest of these Atlantic tropical cyclones begin where scorching winds from the Sahara clash with moist subtropical air over the island nation of Cape Verde off western Africa. The worst of these atmospheric disturbances create severe thunderstorms with giant cumulonimbus clouds that flatten out against the stratosphere. Propelled by the Earth’s rotation, they begin to circle counterclockwise around each other — a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect.</p>



<p>Weather conditions that summer had already spawned two monster hurricanes: Harvey and Irma. By late September, the extremely warm sea surface — 29º Celsius or hotter in some places — gave up its heat energy by way of evaporation into Maria’s rushing winds. All hurricanes begin as an area of low pressure, which in turn sucks in more wind, accelerating the rise of hot air, or convection. Countervailing winds known as shear can sometimes topple the cone of moist air spiraling upward. But that didn’t happen, so Maria continued to grow in size and intensity.</p>



<p>Meteorologists hoped that Maria would lose force as it moved across the Caribbean, weakened by the wake of cooler water Irma had churned up two weeks earlier. Instead, Maria tracked south, steaming toward the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica. Within 15 hours of making landfall, its maximum sustained wind speed doubled, reaching a house-leveling 260 kilometers per hour. That doubling intensified the storm from a milder (still dangerous) Category 1 to a strong Category 5.</p>



<p>NOAA’s computer forecasting models did not anticipate such rapid intensification. Irma had also raged with unforeseen intensity.</p>



<p>After striking Dominica hard, Maria’s eyewall broke down, replaced by an outer band of whipping thunderstorms. This slightly weakened Maria to 250 kilometers per hour before it hit Puerto Rico, while expanding the diameter of the storm’s eyewall — the area of strong winds and heaviest precipitation — to 52 kilometers. That’s close to the width of the island.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="627" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6.jpg" alt="satellite image of the Hurricane Maria with its eye directly over Puerto Rico, outlined in green" class="wp-image-3116709" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6-629x383.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6-739x450.jpg 739w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6-306x186.jpg 306w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6-768x468.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_hurricane_inline6-953x580.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116709">Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico early in the morning on September 20, 2017, and cut across the island diagonally toward the northwest. Its eyewall generated maximum sustained winds of&nbsp; 250 kilometers per hour and spanned almost the width of the island.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116709">CIRA/NOAA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s still not fully understood why Maria had suddenly gone berserk. Various theories point to the influence of hot towers — convective bursts of heat energy from thunderclouds that punch up into the stratosphere — or deep warm pools, buoyant freshwater eddies spilling out of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers into the Atlantic, where currents carry these pockets of hurricane-fueling heat to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.</p>



<p>But even though these smaller-scale events may have a big impact on intensity, they aren’t fully accounted for in weather models, says Hua Leighton, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s hurricane research division and the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. Leighton develops forecasting models and investigates rapid intensification of hurricanes.</p>



<p>“We cannot measure everything in the atmosphere,” Leighton says.</p>



<p>Without accurate data on all the factors that drive hurricane intensity, computer models can’t easily predict when the catalyzing events will occur, she says. Nor can models account for everything that happens inside the ocean during a hurricane. They don’t have the data.</p>



<p>Positioning instruments just before a hurricane hits is a major challenge. But NOAA is making progress. It has launched a new generation of hurricane <a href="http://www.hurricanescience.org/science/observation/ships/weatherbuoys/">weather buoys</a> in the western North Atlantic and remote control surface sensors called Saildrones that examine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-antarctica-absorbs-less-carbon-expected">the air-sea interface between hurricanes and the ocean</a> (<em>SN: 6/8/19, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>Underwater, NOAA uses other drones, or gliders, to profile the vast areas regularly traversed by tropical storms. These gliders <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/news/hurricane-gliders-return-home-2020/">collected 13,200 temperature and salinity readings</a> in 2020. By contrast, the instruments that the team set in Puerto Rico’s waters in 2017 collected over 250 million data points, including current velocity and direction — a rare and especially valuable glimpse of hurricane-induced ocean dynamics at a single location.</p>



<h4>A different view</h4>



<p>After the storm passed, Storlazzi was sure the hurricane had destroyed his instruments. They weren’t designed to take that kind of punishment. The devices generally work in much calmer conditions, not the massive swells generated by Maria, which could increase water pressure to a level that would almost certainly crush instrument sensors.</p>



<p>But remarkably, the instruments were battered but not lost. Sherman, Carlo and Touhy retrieved them after Maria passed and put them in crates awaiting the research group’s return.</p>

<p>When Storlazzi and USGS oceanographer Kurt Rosenberger pried open the instrument casings in January 2018, no water gushed out. Good sign. The electronics appeared intact. And the lithium batteries had powered the rapid-fire sampling enterprise for the entire six-month duration. The researchers quickly downloaded a flood of data, backed it up and started transmitting it to Cheriton, who began sending back plots and graphs of what the readings showed.</p>



<p>Floodwaters from the massive rains brought by Maria had <a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70204492">pushed a whole lot of polluted sediment to the reefs</a> outside Guánica Bay, spiking PCB concentrations and threatening coral health. As of a few months after the storm, the pollution hadn’t reached the deeper reefs.</p>



<p>Then the researchers realized that their data told another story: what happens underwater during a massive hurricane. They presumed that other researchers had previously captured a profile of the churning ocean depths beneath a hurricane at the edge of a tropical island.</p>



<p>Remarkably, that was not the case.</p>



<p>“Nobody’s even measured this, let alone reported it in any published literature,” Cheriton says. The team began to explore the hurricane data not knowing where it might lead.</p>



<p>“What am I looking at here?” Cheriton kept asking herself as she plotted and analyzed temperature, current velocity and salinity values using computer algorithms. The temperature gradient that showed the ocean’s internal or underwater waves was different than anything she’d seen before.</p>

<p>During the hurricane, the top 20 meters of the Caribbean Sea had consistently remained at or above 26º C, a few degrees warmer than the layers beneath. But the surface waters should have been cooled if, as expected, Maria’s winds had acted like a big spoon, mixing the warm surface with cold water stirred up from the seafloor 50 to 80 meters below. Normally, the cooler surface temperature restricts the heat supply, weakening the hurricane. But the cold water wasn’t reaching the surface.</p>



<p>To try to make sense of what she was seeing, Cheriton imagined herself inside the data, in a protective bubble on the seafloor with the instruments as Maria swept over. Storlazzi worked alongside her analyzing the data, but focused on the sediments circulating around the coral reefs.</p>



<p>Cheriton was listening to “An Awesome Wave” by indie-pop band Alt-J and getting goosebumps while the data swirled before them. Drawing on instincts from her undergraduate astronomy training, she focused her mind’s eye on a constellation of data overhead and told Storlazzi to do the same.</p>



<p>“Look up Curt!” she said.</p>



<p>Up at the crest of the island shelf, where the seafloor drops off, the current velocity data revealed a broad stream of water gushing from the shore at almost 1 meter per second, as if from a fire hose. Several hours before Maria arrived, the wind-driven current had reversed direction and was now moving an order of magnitude faster. The rushing surface water thus became a barrier, trapping the cold water beneath it.</p>



<p>As a result, the surface stayed warm, increasing the force of the hurricane. The cooler layers below then started to pile up vertically into distinct layers, one on top of the other, beneath the gushing waters above.</p>



<p>Cheriton calculated that with the fire hose phenomenon the contribution from coastal waters in this area to Maria’s intensity was, on average, 65 percent greater, compared with what it would have been otherwise.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Fire hose effect&nbsp; </h3>



<p>USGS data from the deep shelf south of Puerto Rico showed that Hurricane Maria’s winds shifted the direction and flow of the surface water with such power that cool waters from deep in the Caribbean Sea were unable to rise to the surface and cool the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oceanographer Travis Miles of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who was not involved in the research, calls Cheriton and the team’s work a “frontier study” that draws researchers’ attention to near-shore processes. Miles can relate to Cheriton and her team’s accidental hurricane discovery from personal experience: When his water quality–sampling gliders wandered into Hurricane Irene’s path in 2011, they revealed that the ocean off the Jersey Shore had cooled in front of the storm. Irene’s onshore winds had induced seawater mixing across the broad continental shelf and lowered sea surface temperatures.</p>



<p>The Puerto Rico data show that offshore winds over a steep island shelf produced the opposite effect and should help researchers better understand storm-induced mixing of coastal areas, says NOAA senior scientist Hyun-Sook Kim, who was not involved in the research. It can help with identifying deficiencies in the computer models she relies on when providing guidance to storm-tracking meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center in Miami and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii.</p>



<p>And the unexpected findings also could help scientists get a better handle on coral reefs and the role they play in protecting coastlines. “The more we study the ocean, especially close to the coast,” Carlo says, “the more we can improve conditions for the coral and the people living on the island.”</p>

As the <i>NYT</i>, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/wyss-tribune-company-buyer.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span lang="EN-GB">put it</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, “The Hub Project it is not a stand-alone organisation for tax purposes, but is housed within two Arabella-managed non-profits, New Venture Fund and the </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/sixteen-thirty-fund/"><span lang="EN-GB">Sixteen Thirty Fund</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, which pay Hub Project employees.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In a second article, <i>NYT</i> </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/hansjorg-wyss-money-democrats.html?"><span lang="EN-GB">noted</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> that Arabella Advisors and the organisations it manages operate a funding model that uses so-called </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money"><span lang="EN-GB">dark money</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. This sees donor money channelled through non-profit organisations like NVF, which in the US are not required to disclose their donors. Arabella’s network, said the <i>NYT</i>, is a leading vehicle for doing this on the left.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As I understand it, this allows funders to donate to a non-profit that then distributes the money to different groups without it being publicly known who the donor was. As part of this process Arabella Advisors provides administrative services to organisations like NVF, much in the way that NVF provides such services to SPARC. Unlike NVF, however, Arabella is a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The money channelled through NVF is not insubstantial. “Between 2007 and last year,” the <i>NYT </i></span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/wyss-tribune-company-buyer.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span lang="EN-GB">reported</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, “the Wyss Foundation donated roughly $56.5 million to New Venture Fund.” (This figure is based on tax returns and </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.wyssfoundation.org/grants"><span lang="EN-GB">voluntary disclosures</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Neither </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">NYT</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">article mentions SPARC, but it is one of around 150 “projects” that have administrative agreements with NVF. In doing so they become part of a non-profit mother ship that confers non-profit status on them too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Referred to as fiscal sponsorship this practice has been increasing in popularity in recent years. And it is a model that a number of open access organisations have begun to use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is not clear to me is how many OA advocates are aware that OA organisations have started to use fiscal sponsorship and, if they are, whether they fully understand how it works and are comfortable with it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I confess I had myself barely registered the fact that SPARC had decoupled from ARL. And as I think will be apparent, I do not fully understand how fiscal sponsorship works, or the implications it might have for the OA movement if widely adopted by OA organisations and initiatives. I do, however, have some thoughts on it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship"><span lang="EN-GB">says</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> this of the model: “Fiscal sponsorship refers to the practice of non-profit organisations offering their legal and tax-exempt status to groups – typically projects – engaged in activities related to the sponsoring organisation’s mission. It typically involves a fee-based contractual arrangement between a project and an established non-profit.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I think it is worth repeating that while the groups it manages are non-profit, Arabella Advisors is itself a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Small organisations can undoubtedly benefit from outsourcing their administration in this way. However, Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship#Risks"><span lang="EN-GB">points out</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> that there are risks too. For instance, it says, “the benefits of immediate tax-exempt status and administrative support must be weighed against the lack of autonomy and fees typically charged by the sponsor.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It seems to me that any OA organisation signing a fiscal sponsorship agreement that wishes to remain true to its principles ought really to make a special effort to be transparent about its finances and activities. The risk is that it could end up embracing a degree of darkness that belies its commitment to openness.<span></span></span></p><a name='more'></a><p></p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-size: large;">Two issues</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As one of 150 projects managed by NVF, for instance, SPARC’s financial statements appear to be amalgamated into NFV’s public disclosure document – its </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">990 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. In the process, SPARC’s financial figures are invisibilised, at least so far as the public eye is concerned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The only financial information related to SPARC that I could find in NVF’s </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">900 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is the salary of Heather Joseph ($313,068 in 2020). The word “SPARC” itself does not seem to appear anywhere in the 990 Form.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We could also note that SPARC does not publish a definitive list of the grants it co-sponsors. This is not a consequence of SPARC’s agreement with NVF, says Joseph, but the insistence of some funders that they remain anonymous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A requirement of the contract that SPARC has signed with NVF, however, is that it is not made publicly available. While this might be for understandable reasons, it adds to a sense of opaqueness around SPARC’s activities and might cause some to wonder to what extent SPARC has retained self-determination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph insists that SPARC is still entirely independent. She also points out that the details of the arrangement SPARC had with ARL were not published either. However, SPARC is not the organisation today that it was when it was under ARL’s wing – that, after all, is why SPARC moved to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is also not clear (to me at least) is why NVF needs to use for-profit Arabella Advisors to provide it with services that it itself provides to others. Again, there may be a good reason for this, but it surely further muddies the waters from a public perception point of view.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In short, I am not convinced that SPARC’s fiscal sponsorship arrangement with NVF (and, via NVF, its relationship with Arabella Advisors) is a good fit for an organisation dedicated to making the world a more open and transparent place, and which is now </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/invest-in-open-infrastructure-launches/"><span lang="EN-GB">supporting</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> those in the open access movement who want to take back scholarly publishing from for-profit organisations. However, more transparency from SPARC would surely help.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Essentially, I see two main issues. First, as noted, SPARC’s financial statements are not publicly available. While Joseph agreed to share with me the headline income figures for 2020 (below), we might wonder why it was necessary to ask for them. And we might wonder why SPARC does not publish its full financial figures on its website every year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here too Joseph points out that when SPARC was a program within ARL its financial statements were not posted online either. As such, she says, it is just a continuation of a long-standing practice and not contingent on its relationship with NVF. Personally, I am not persuaded by the long-standing practice argument – particularly given the OA movement’s demands that publishers provide ever greater transparency about their operations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second, in not publishing a comprehensive list of the grants it co-sponsors with NVF, SPARC might seem to be acting against the principles of openness that it espouses. True, some grants </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">are</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> disclosed, but what percentage of the total funds distributed this represents is unclear. Joseph says that the “vast majority of philanthropies that SPARC has received funding from” are happy to have SPARC publicly acknowledge them. What this means in practice would only be fully apparent if SPARC published a full, detailed list.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph explains that SPARC has to be pragmatic about this because donors sometimes insist on anonymity. I take this to mean that if SPARC wants to receive money from such a donor it has to choose either to compromise on its commitment to openness, or forego the proffered grant. Some might feel that SPARC should not be compromising in this way. And while it may not be a consequence of SPARC’s agreement with NVF, it does raise questions about openness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We might also wonder why any funder who wants to support an organisation whose </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">raison d’être</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">is to increase openness and transparency would insist on darkness. Call me naïve if you will.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It could be argued that, as a membership organisation, SPARC has no obligation to share information about its finances with the world. However, leaving aside SPARC’s professed support for openness, 50% of its income comes from grants rather than membership dues. It also enjoys the tax benefits of being part of a </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization"><span lang="EN-GB">501c3 non-profit</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. That suggests to me that there <i>is</i> an obligation on SPARC to publish its financial statements.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">More importantly, perhaps, as an influential advocacy group, SPARC has had – and continues to have – a significant impact on the global research community. More specifically, it has played an important role in changing the way that scholarly publishing operates.

We might also wonder whether, in its relationship with NVF (and thus Arabella), SPARC has positioned itself in a larger political landscape that some OA advocates may find unpalatable or alienating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A key question I think is whether the scholarly community is aware of how fiscal sponsorship works, and, more specifically, of how the relationship between SPARC and NVF operates.

Two did not reply, three said they were either unaware that SPARC had a fiscal sponsorship agreement or did not feel sufficiently competent or knowledgeable about the model to comment. The last said that he had received funding from NVF co-sponsored by SPARC and that since there is a clear governance process at SPARC, he presumes there is adequate oversight over SPARC’s spendings and donations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/author/planxty/"><span lang="EN-GB">Rick Anderson</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, University Librarian at </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.byu.edu/"><span lang="EN-GB">Brigham Young University</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> and a “chef” at the </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/"><span lang="EN-GB">Scholarly Kitchen</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, takes a less sanguine view. “It seems to me that someone ought to ask SPARC, publicly, to explain why important elements of its financing are hidden from public view,” he said. “It may be legal, but that doesn’t make it okay.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As noted, fiscal sponsorship seems to be growing in the OA movement.

NVF was the best fit for a variety of reasons including cost, services, and mission alignment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are quite a few advantages of having a fiscal sponsor, particularly if you are a small organisation (SPARC had only 4 FTE when we made the move). Because they provide services across a large number of projects (NVF currently provides services to over 150 projects), it lets us take advantage of economies of scale on everything from health insurance to retirement benefits to legal services we simply couldn’t do on our own.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It also allows SPARC staff to focus on mission-critical activities and leave the bulk of legal, human resources, accounting, and administrative tasks, etc. to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">An added draw for us was that NVF also provides SPARC with a large community of other social justice organisations and initiatives, and we’ve benefited greatly from being a part of it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">And – you are correct, the agreement was not posted publicly; given the wide range of sensitive issue areas their projects cover, it’s NVF’s policy not to do so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">For what it’s worth, we didn’t post our annual operating contracts with ARL either.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">BTW: the use of fiscal sponsor organisations is on the increase in the open movement; in particular </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://codeforscience.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Code for Science &amp; Society</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is emerging as a popular choice – their projects include </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.prereview.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">PREreview</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Invest in Open Infrastructure</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.researchsoft.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Research Software Alliance</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, among others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">RP: On Twitter recently you </span></i></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://twitter.com/hjoseph/status/1479223891264430083?s=20"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">said</span></i></b></a></span><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">, “New Venture Fund is our fiscal sponsor (help us w/ HR, compliance, and other back-office support).” Can you say more about this and how much SPARC pays to NVF annually?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">HJ:</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> Sure thing.

The “dark money” issue is about transparency preferences of donors. As we know first-hand at SPARC, many grant-making organisations and donors prefer not to be named. That definitely presents challenges for SPARC; as you rightly point out below, as an organisation advocating for open access to knowledge, we work hard to be as open and transparent as we can be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">But we also have to balance the pragmatic realities of the grant-making world with that desire.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-sap-water-power-energy-world">The worldwide water-lifting power of plants is enormous</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to hoisting water, plants are real power lifters.</p>



<p>For a tall tree, slurping hundreds of liters of water each day up to its leaves or needles, where photosynthesis takes place, can be quite a haul. Even for short grasses and shrubs, rising sap must somehow overcome gravity and resistance from plant tissues. Now, a first-of-its-kind study has estimated the power needed to lift sap to plants’ foliage worldwide — and it’s a prodigious amount, almost as much as all hydroelectric power generated globally.</p>





<p>Over the course of a year, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JG006922">plants harness 9.4 quadrillion watt-hours of sap-pumping power</a>, climatologist Gregory Quetin and colleagues report August 17 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences.</em> That’s about 90 percent of the amount of hydroelectric power produced worldwide in 2019.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">Evaporation of water from foliage</a> drives the suction that pulls sap upward, says Quetin, of the University of California, Santa Barbara (<em>SN: 3/24/22</em>). To estimate the total evaporative power for all plants on Earth annually, the team divided up a map of the world’s land area into cells that span 0.5° of latitude by 0.5° of longitude and analyzed data for the mix of plants in each cell that were actively pumping sap each month. The power required was highest, unsurprisingly, in tree-rich areas, especially in the rainforests of the tropics.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Power hungry </h3>

<p>If plants in forest ecosystems had to tap their own energy stores rather than rely on evaporation to pump sap, they’d need to expend about 14 percent of the energy they generated via photosynthesis, the researchers found<em>. </em>Grasses and other plants in nonforest ecosystems would need to expend just over 1 percent of their energy stores, largely because such plants are far shorter and have less resistance to the flow of sap within their tissues than woody plants do.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781771646628">The Hidden Kingdom of Fungi</a><br><em>Keith Seifert<br>Greystone Books, $27.95</em></p>



<p>Take a walk through the woods after it rains, and you can catch a glimpse of the incredible diversity of fungi. You might spot the real-life version of the red-and-white “power-up” mushroom from the video game Super Mario Bros. or the aptly named dead man’s fingers, a blackened fungal growth that resembles a hand emerging from the grave. Perhaps you’ll notice a cluster of frilly pink shelves on a log or a striking purple mushroom that’s a doppelgänger for underwater coral.</p>





<p>But for all that you can see, you’ve barely scratched the surface of the fungal world.</p>



<p>Scientists estimate there are between 1.5 million and 15 million species of fungi but so far have discovered and named only 140,000 or so. Most of that identification was performed with microscopes, but over the last two decades, DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to distinguish large numbers of microfungi. It’s these rarely noticed and poorly understood fungi that mycologist Keith Seifert focuses on in his book <em>The Hidden Kingdom of Fungi.</em></p>



<p>Seifert has spent his career “obsessing over Latin names of fungi” but recognizes that taxonomy may not come easily to his readers. So he begins with a note on scientific names, explaining why they’re a “necessary evil” and providing a primer on the modern classification system, likening it to “a phone book for looking up the evolutionary address of a fungus.”</p>





<p>From there, the book explores fungi&#8217;s evolutionary journey and the various <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-study-digs-partnership-between-fungi-and-plants">symbiotic relationships they have with other organisms</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/15</em>)<em>. </em>These relationships have muddied scientists’ picture of ecology and evolution. In the traditional view of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin, competition is seen as the driving force of natural selection. But Darwin “underplayed the significance of cooperation in nature,” Seifert writes. Take <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof/special_issues/Lichens_sensors">the evolutionary success of lichens</a>, a highly diverse group that has spread around the world. These complex organisms consist of an alga and fungus living together in a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Seifert delves deeper into fungi’s complicated relationships with other organisms, covering the role fungi play in forest ecology, agriculture, fermentation, the built environment and even the human body. Here, there’s something for everyone. Nature lovers will enjoy learning about the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/communism-trees-goes-underground">“Wood Wide Web”</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/97</em>), an underground network of mycorrhizal fungi that connect to tree roots, enabling trees to exchange water, nutrients and minerals. Gardeners and farmers can gain applicable knowledge about the fungi that can help or harm crops. Foodies will find themselves singing fungi’s praises after learning about the yeasts and molds that give us the “sacred fungal trilogy” of wine, cheese and chocolate. But many readers might cringe as Seifert takes them on a room-by-room tour of which fungal species lurk in a person’s house or shares <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">how fungi can cause illness</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>As the book ends, Seifert focuses on how humans and fungi can build a better world together. Humans have already used fungi to create a range of products like penicillin, stone-washed denim and the meat substitute Quorn. Now, fungi are also helping with environmental cleanup and the creation of leather-like textiles and solid building materials. We’ve put only a few fungal species to work so far, but the possibilities are endless. Seifert paints a picture of what a healthier, more sustainable future could look like, with fungal foam beds and bioluminescent lamps. Such a future isn’t some far-off fantasy, he writes, at least from a technological standpoint. But there’s more than just technical know-how in creating a more sustainable and symbiotic world.</p>



<p>We also must reconsider our attitude toward fungi, Seifert says. “If we are going to make peace with fungi, we need to be aware of their biodiversity and embrace their talents for biodegradation, symbiosis, and biochemistry that make them such significant players in the environment,” he writes. “Only then will we be able to work with them effectively for our own prosperity and health, while they also collaborate with us.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/democracy-indigenous-americans-people-rule-muscogee">Indigenous Americans ruled democratically long before the U.S. did</a></h4>

              
                <p>On sunny summer days, powerboats pulling water-skiers zip across Georgia’s Lake Oconee, a reservoir located about an hour-and-a-half drive east of Atlanta. For those without a need for speed, fishing beckons.</p>



<p>Little do the lake’s visitors suspect that here lie the remains of a democratic institution that dates to around 500 A.D., more than 1,200 years before the founding of the U.S. Congress.</p>



<p>Reservoir waters, which flooded the Oconee Valley in 1979 after the construction of a nearby dam, partly cover remnants of a 1,500-year-old plaza once bordered by flat-topped earthen mounds and at least three large, circular buildings. Such structures, which have been linked to collective decision making, are known from other southeastern U.S. sites that date to as early as around 1,000 years ago.</p>





<p>At the Oconee site, called Cold Springs, artifacts were excavated before the valley became an aquatic playground. Now, new older-than-expected radiocarbon dates for those museum-held finds <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/early-materialization-of-democratic-institutions-among-the-ancestral-muskogean-of-the-american-southeast/5B00F098F5A279B3EDC97E2BB0944FC5">push back the origin of democratic institutions in the Americas several centuries</a>, a team led by archaeologist Victor Thompson of the University of Georgia in Athens reported May 18 in <em>American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Institutions such as these highlight a growing realization among archaeologists that early innovations in democratic rule emerged independently in many parts of the world. In specific, these findings add to evidence that Native American institutions devoted to promoting broad participation in political decisions emerged in various regions, including what’s now Canada, the United States and Mexico, long before 18th century Europeans took up the cause of democratic rule by the people.</p>



<p>That conclusion comes as no surprise to members of some Indigenous groups today. “Native people have been trying to convey for centuries that many communities have long-standing institutions [of] democratic and/or republican governance,” says University of Alberta archaeologist S. Margaret Spivey-Faulkner, a citizen of the Pee Dee Indian Nation of Beaver Creek in South Carolina.</p>



<h4>Democratic innovations</h4>



<p>Scholars have traditionally thought that democracy — generally referring to rule by the people, typically via elected representatives — originated around 2,500 years ago in Greece before spreading elsewhere in Europe. From that perspective, governments in the Americas that qualified as democratic didn’t exist before Europeans showed up. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That argument is as misguided as Christopher Columbus’ assumption that he had arrived in East India, not the Caribbean, in 1492, says archaeologist Jacob Holland-Lulewicz of Penn State, a coauthor of the Cold Springs report. Institutions that enabled representatives of large communities to govern collectively, without kings or ruling chiefs, characterized an unappreciated number of Indigenous societies long before the Italian explorer’s fateful first voyage, Holland-Lulewicz asserts.</p>



<p>In fact, collective decision-making arrangements that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-history-society-dawn-of-everything-book">kept anyone from amassing too much power and wealth</a> go back thousands, and probably tens of thousands of years in many parts of the world (<em>SN: 11/9/21</em>). The late anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow of University College London describe evidence for that scenario in their 2021 book <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>.</p>



<p>But only in the last 20 years have archaeologists begun to take seriously claims that ancient forms of democratic rule existed. Scientific investigations informed by Indigenous partners will unveil past political realities “most of us in Indian country take for granted,” Spivey-Faulkner says.</p>



<h4>Early consensus</h4>



<p>Thompson’s Cold Springs project shows how such a partnership can work.</p>



<p>Ancestors of today&#8217;s Muscogee people erected Cold Springs structures within their original homelands, which once covered a big chunk of southeastern North America before the government-forced exodus west along the infamous Trail of Tears. Three members of the Muscogee Nation’s Department of Historic and Cultural Preservation in Okmulgee, Okla., all study coauthors, provided archaeologists with first-hand knowledge of Muscogee society. They emphasized to the researchers that present-day Muscogee councils where open debate informs consensus decisions carry on a tradition that goes back hundreds of generations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of 44 new radiocarbon dates going back 1,500 years for material previously unearthed at the Georgia site, including what were likely interior posts from some structures, then made perfect sense. Earlier analyses in the 1970s of excavated pottery and six radiocarbon dates from two earthen mounds at Cold Springs suggested that they had been constructed at least 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Based on the new dating, Thompson’s team found that from roughly 500 A.D. to 700 A.D, Indigenous people at Cold Springs constructed not only earthen mounds but at least three council-style roundhouses — each 12 to 15 meters in diameter — and several smaller structures possibly used as temporary housing during meetings and ceremonies.</p>



<p>Small communities spread across the Oconee Valley formed tight-knit social networks called clans that gathered at council houses through the 1700s, Thompson’s group suspects. Spanish expeditions through the region from 1539 to 1543 did not cause those societies and their traditions to collapse, as has often been assumed, the researchers contend.</p>

<p>Excavations and radiocarbon dating at another Oconee Valley Muscogee site called Dyar support that view. A square ground connected to Dyar includes remains of a council house. Activity at the site began &nbsp;as early as 1350 and continued until as late as about 1670, or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/enduring-traditions-and-the-immateriality-of-early-colonial-encounters-in-the-southeastern-united-states/709B1189E8134314A0096F5BB1D38A44">about 130 years after first encounters</a> with the Spanish, Holland-Lulewicz and colleagues reported in the October 2020 <em>American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Spanish historical accounts mistakenly assumed that powerful chiefs ran Indigenous communities in what have become known as chiefdoms. Many archaeologists have similarly, and just as wrongly, assumed that starting around 1,000 years ago, chiefs monopolized power in southeastern Native American villages, the scientists argue.</p>



<p>Today, members of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma gather, sometimes by the hundreds or more, in circular structures called council houses to reach collective decisions about various community issues. Council houses typically border public square grounds. That’s a modern-day parallel to the story being told by the ancient architecture at Cold Springs.</p>



<p>“Muscogee councils are the longest-surviving democratic institution in the world,” Holland-Lulewicz says.</p>



<h4>Indigenous influencers</h4>



<p>Political consensus building by early Muscogee people didn’t occur in a vacuum. Across different regions of precontact North America, institutions that enabled broad participation in democratic governing characterized Indigenous societies that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.840049/full">had no kings, central state governments or bureaucracies</a>, Holland-Lulewicz and colleagues, report March 11 in <em>Frontiers in Political Science</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers dub such organizations keystone institutions. Representatives of households, communities, clans and religious societies, to name a few, met on equal ground at keystone institutions. Here, all manner of groups and organizations followed common rules to air their opinions and hammer out decisions about, say, distributing crops, organizing ceremonial events and resolving disputes.</p>

<p>For example, in the early 1600s, nations of the neighboring Wendat (Huron) and Haudenosaunee people in northeastern North America had formed political alliances known as confederacies, says coauthor Jennifer Birch, a University of Georgia archaeologist. Each population contained roughly 20,000 to 30,000 people. Despite their size, these confederacies did not hold elections in which individuals voted for representatives to a central governing body. Governing consisted of negotiations among intertwined segments of society orchestrated by clans, which claimed members across society.</p>



<p>Clans, in which membership was inherited through the female line, were — and still are — the social glue holding together Wendat (Huron) and Haudenosaunee politics. Residents of different villages or nations among, say, the Haudenosaunee, could belong to the same clan, creating a network of social ties. Excavations of Indigenous villages in eastern North America suggest that the earliest clans date to at least 3,000 years ago, Birch says.</p>



<p>Within clans, men and women held separate council meetings. Some councils addressed civil affairs. Others addressed military and foreign policy, typically after receiving counsel from senior clan women.</p>



<p>Clans controlled seats on confederacy councils of the Wendat and Haudenosaunee. But decisions hinged on negotiation and consensus. A member of a particular clan had no right to interfere in the affairs of any other clan. Members of villages or nations could either accept or reject a clan leader as their council representative. Clans could also join forces to pursue political or military objectives.</p>



<p>Some researchers, including Graeber and Wengrow, suspect a Wendat philosopher and statesman named Kandiaronk influenced ideas about democracy among Enlightenment thinkers in France and elsewhere. A 1703 book based on a French aristocrat’s conversations with Kandiaronk critiqued authoritarian European states and provided an Indigenous case for decentralized, representative governing.</p>



<p>Although Kandiaronk was a real person, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity-david-graeber-and-david-wengrow-2021-farrar-straus-and-giroux-new-york-xii-692-pp-3500-hardcover-isbn-9780374157357/8459DF1B04F20E239E0C04E2BD69FE0F">it’s unclear whether that book presented his actual ideas</a> or altered them to resemble what Europeans thought of as a “noble savage,” Birch says.</p>



<p>Researchers also debate whether writers of the U.S. Constitution were influenced by how the Haudenosaunee Confederacy distributed power among allied nations. <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/influence-on-democracy/">Benjamin Franklin learned about Haudenosaunee politics during the 1740s and 1750s</a> as colonists tried to establish treaties with the confederacy.</p>



<p>Colonists took selected political ideas from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy without grasping its underlying cultural concerns, says University of Alberta anthropological archaeologist Kisha Supernant, a member of an Indigenous population in Canada called Métis. The U.S. Constitution stresses individual freedoms, whereas the Indigenous system addresses collective responsibilities to manage the land, water, animals and people, she says.</p>



<h4>Anti-Aztec equality</h4>



<p>If democratic institutions are cultural experiments in power sharing, one of the most interesting examples emerged around 700 years ago in central Mexico.</p>



<p>In response to growing hostilities from surrounding allies of the Aztec Empire, a multi-ethnic confederation of villages called Tlaxcallan built a densely occupied city of the same name. When Spaniards arrived in 1519, they wrote of Tlaxcallan as a city without kings, rulers or wealthy elites.</p>

<p>Until the last decade, Mexican historians had argued that Tlaxcallan was a minor settlement, not a city. &nbsp;They dismissed historical Spanish accounts as exaggerations of the newcomers’ exploits.</p>



<p>Opinions changed after a team led by archaeologist Lane Fargher of Mexico’s Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polytécnico Nacional (Cinvestav del IPN) in Merida surveyed and mapped visible remains of Tlaxcallan structures from 2007 to 2010. Excavations followed from 2015 through 2018, revealing a much larger and denser settlement than previously suspected.</p>



<p>The ancient city covers a series of hilltops and hillsides, Fargher says. Large terraces carved out of hillsides supported houses, public structures, plazas, earthen mounds and roadways. Around 35,000 people inhabited an area of about 4.5 square kilometers in the early 1500s.</p>



<p>Artifacts recovered at plazas indicate that those open spaces hosted commercial, political and religious activities. Houses clustered around plazas. Even the largest residences were modest in size, not much larger than the smallest houses. Palaces of kings and political big shots in neighboring societies, including the Aztecs, dwarfed Tlaxcallan houses.</p>

Building materials and construction quality are comparable for all structures.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116797">L. Fargher</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Excavations and Spanish accounts add up to a scenario in which all Tlaxcallan citizens could participate in governmental affairs. Anyone known to provide good advice on local issues could be elected by their neighbors in a residential district to a citywide ruling council, or senate, consisting of between 50 and 200 members. Council meetings were held at a civic-ceremonial center built on a hilltop about one kilometer from Tlaxcallan.</p>



<p>As many as 4,000 people attended council meetings regarding issues of utmost importance, such as launching military campaigns, Fargher says.</p>



<p>Those chosen for council positions had to endure a public ceremony in which they were stripped naked, shoved, hit and insulted as a reminder that they served the people. Political officials who accumulated too much wealth could be publicly punished, replaced or even killed.</p>



<p>Tlaxcallan wasn’t a social utopia. Women, for instance, had limited political power, possibly because the main route to government positions involved stints of military service. But in many ways,<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.832440/full"> political participation at Tlaxcallan equaled or exceeded</a> that documented for ancient Greek democracy, Fargher and colleagues reported March 29 in <em>Frontiers of Political Science</em>. Greeks from all walks of life gathered in public spaces to speak freely about political issues. But commoners and the poor could not hold the highest political offices. And again, women were excluded.</p>



<h4>Good government</h4>



<p>Tlaxcallan aligned itself with Spanish conquerors against their common Aztec enemy. Then in 1545, the Spanish divided the Tlaxcallan state into four fiefdoms, ending Tlaxcallan’s homegrown style of democratic rule.</p>



<p>The story of this fierce, equality-minded government illustrates the impermanence of political systems that broadly distribute power, Fargher says. Research on past societies worldwide “shows us how bad the human species is at building and maintaining democratic governments,” he contends.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Richard Blanton of Purdue University and colleagues, including Fargher, analyzed whether 30 premodern societies dating to as early as around 3,000 years ago <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713286">displayed signs of “good government.”</a> An overall score of government quality included evidence of systems for providing equal justice, fair taxation, control over political officials’ power and a political voice for all citizens.</p>



<p>Only eight societies received high scores, versus 12 that scored low, Blanton’s group reported in the February 2021 <em>Current Anthropology</em>. The remaining 10 societies partly qualified as good governments. Many practices of societies scoring highest on good government mirrored policies of liberal democracies over the past century, the researchers concluded.</p>



<p>That’s only a partial view of how past governments operated. But <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy">surveys of modern nations suggest that no more than half feature strong democratic institutions</a>, Fargher says.</p>



<p>Probing the range of democratic institutions that societies have devised over the millennia may inspire reforms to modern democratic nations facing growing income disparities and public distrust of authorities, Holland-Lulewicz suspects. Leaders and citizens of stressed democracies today might start with a course on power sharing in Indigenous societies. School will be in session at the next meeting of the Muscogee National Council.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-global-coverage-should-be-too">Science is global, so our coverage should be too</a></h4>

              
                <p>The United States has been a world leader in science for decades, both in investment and in volume of research published. But now many countries beyond North America and Europe, including China, India, Japan and South Korea, have become research powerhouses in their own right.</p>



<p>So covering just U.S.-based research would do the readers of <em>Science News </em>a disservice, since it fails to reflect the reality of science as a human endeavor common to all cultures. Thus, we’re always on the lookout for journalists in other countries who can report on science beyond our borders.</p>





<p>In this issue, science journalist Geoffrey Kamadi reports from Kenya on community efforts to restore mangrove forests, which can bring in revenue from ecotourism and carbon offsets. Local residents conduct surveys of the forest and work with organizations in Kenya and elsewhere to analyze data and sell carbon credits to companies worldwide looking to offset their climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The revenue supports jobs and projects including buying new schoolbooks and improving the community’s water supply.</p>



<p>To report the article, Kamadi took a seven-hour train trip from his home in Nairobi to the coastal city of Mombasa, and then a 45-minute taxi ride to the village of Gazi. He spent two days talking with residents and researchers and taking photographs. “There’s a tangible effect to what they’re doing,” Kamadi told me by phone. “They can actually see the results of their effort.”</p>

Kamadi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kamadi has always been fascinated by science, he says, so he decided to make it his focus as a journalist. He’s written for publications in Africa and beyond. In 2020, his article on how the destruction of a water catchment area for a major river in Kenya is disrupting lives downstream won a AAAS Kavli Gold Science Journalism Award. “Science is about unearthing the truth,” he says. “It’s about explaining things and providing solutions to things we humans face.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">What you need to know about the new omicron booster shots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Revamped COVID-19 vaccines are poised to do battle with the super-contagious omicron variant.</p>



<p>On September 1, U.S. health officials greenlit the first major update of the mRNA-based shots, reformulated to recognize both the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and the recently circulating versions of omicron. Those mRNA vaccine boosters could start going into arms within days.</p>



<p>“They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html">endorsing a vaccine advisory committee’s approval</a> of the shots.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Both Moderna and Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-booster-omicron-variant-coronavirus">created boosters</a> that contain instructions for making the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants’ spike protein as well as the original virus’ spike protein (<em>SN: 6/30/22</em>). Those two variants now account for nearly all the new cases in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use">emergency use authorization</a> for the shots August 31. The CDC action means the Pfizer booster is now OK’d for those 12 and older; Moderna’s shot is for those 18 and older.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-adapted-covid-19-booster-vaccines-recommended-approval-eu">European Medicines Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2022/09/health-canada-authorizes-first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-for-adults-18-years-and-older.html">Health Canada</a> also authorized use of an updated booster vaccine on September 1. That one, made by Moderna, contains mRNA instructions for building the original coronavirus spike protein and the spike protein from the omicron BA.1 subvariant. The United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia have already given the nod for use of that dual, or bivalent, booster.</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about the new shots:</p>



<h4>Should I get a booster shot?</h4>



<p>Probably. The CDC now recommends that all fully vaccinated people 12 and older get the bivalent shot, provided it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. “If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,” Walensky said.</p>



<p>That recommendation comes regardless of how many boosters people have already had.</p>



<p>“If you perceive this as big change … you’re right,” Evelyn Twentyman, who leads CDC’s vaccine policy unit, said September 1 during the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2022-09-01-02.html">vaccine advisory committee meeting</a>. “We want to emphasize we’re no longer looking at total number of doses,” she said. From now on, the agency hopes to transition into a more regular schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, similar to getting annual flu shots. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The original vaccines will still be used for the first two doses, but bivalent vaccines will replace the old boosters for all but 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer’s original vaccine booster is still available for that age group but bivalent vaccines may come later this year for children as young as 6 months old.</p>



<p>There was another big difference this time around: The decision to move forward with the BA.4/5 boosters was made without data from human trials. Such trials are under way, but results won’t be known until the end of the year.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In authorizing the new boosters without clinical trial data, the agencies are treating COVID-19 vaccines more like annual flu vaccines.</p>



<p>Data collected from people immunized with the BA.1 boosters and data from studies of mice inoculated with the BA.4/5 vaccine were used as evidence of the new boosters’ likely safety and effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency said in a Sept. 2 press briefing that it would <a href="https://twitter.com/EMA_News/status/1565673077412855808">also use the BA.1 booster to evaluate the new shots</a>.</p>



<h4>Why do the shots target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants?</h4>



<p>“We very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNFES1RLf1M">deliberately picked BA.4/5</a>,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines, said in a news briefing August 31.</p>



<p>Both companies have tested vaccines based on the omicron BA.1 variant in humans. But BA.1, which caused the massive surge earlier in the year, is no longer circulating in the United States. As of the week of August 21 through 27, BA.5 was projected to cause about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html&amp;fbclid=IwAR20LcCiCyoPDMoPXYAuRd9rIL3w3OxU45OEo4_pdpAGFbuwvIXdU6pfw0w#variant-proportions">89 percent of COVID-19 cases</a>, with BA.4 variants responsible for about 11 percent of cases.</p>



<p>“This gives us a variant that is most up-to-date, and most likely looks closer to something that may evolve further in the fall,” Marks said. “The more up-to-date you are, the better chance we have of [the vaccine] working for what comes afterward.”</p>



<p>All omicron subvariants share common mutations. But the shape of BA.4/5’s spike protein <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/03-COVID-Thornburg-508.pdf">looks much different to the immune system</a> than other omicron subvariants do, the CDC’s Natalie Thornburg said at the advisory committee meeting. Those differences may train immune cells to build a wider variety of antibodies that can latch onto a broad array of variants.</p>



<p>Mice inoculated with a BA.4/5 containing booster had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/06-COVID-Miller-508.pdf">fewer viruses in their lungs</a> than mice given a BA.1 boosters, Moderna’s Jacqueline Miller said at the CDC meeting. The mice make a human version of ACE2, the protein on the surface of cells that the coronavirus uses to gain entry. Mouse studies of earlier variant boosters corresponded well to levels of protection seen in human clinical trials, Miller said, so the company is hopeful that the BA.4/5 booster will provide good protection, too.</p>



<p>Bivalent vaccines perform better — raising antibody levels higher in people and animals — than ones that contain just the original spike protein or only a variant spike protein, Miller said. The spike protein that grabs onto human cells is a three-pronged claw. With the bivalent vaccine, each prong could be either an original or an omicron version. The mixed claw may expose parts of the spike to the immune system that are normally hidden, Miller suggested.</p>

<h4>Why now?</h4>



<p>Though the mouse data suggest the BA.4/5 booster will work, some of the CDC advisers said they’d be more comfortable having data from the ongoing human clinical trials before recommending the new shots. That data could be available in a couple of months, so why not wait?</p>



<p>The wait could cost lives and money, computer projections suggest. The COVID-19 scenario modeling hub, a consortium of pandemic forecasters who predict COVID-19 patterns over the next six months under varying conditions, considered what would happen in the United States if the boosters were given in September or not until November. Waiting would lead to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths</a>, the researchers projected.</p>



<p>An early fall booster campaign could <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/how-many-lives-could-fall-covid-19-booster-campaign-save-united-states">save more than $62 billion in direct medical costs</a>, an analysis from the Commonwealth Fund projects.</p>



<h4>Is it safe?</h4>



<p>Based on studies with the BA.1 bivalent booster, yes. That shot produced similar side effects to the original shots.</p>



<p>And it’s also safe to get <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/09-COVID-Hall-508.pdf">flu shots and other vaccines</a>, including ones used against monkeypox, at the same time as the COVID-19 booster. In fact, doctors should offer all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit, Elisha Hall of the CDC said.</p>



<p>Some data indicate that the chance of serious side effects, like heart inflammation called myocarditis, happen at similar or lower rates with boosters than with the second doses of the mRNA vaccines. The side effect is rare; CDC has verified <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/05-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf">131 myocarditis cases out of more than 126 million booster doses</a> given, Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Unit reported. The rate of myocarditis is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">1.8 to 5.6 times higher after a COVID-19 infection</a> than after vaccination for 12- to 17-year-old males — the group for which the condition has the highest risk, the CDC’s Sara Oliver said. &nbsp;Spacing the booster at least two months after the last dose of vaccine may help to head off any increase in myocarditis, Marks said in the FDA press briefing.</p>



<p>“We have a tremendous amount of experience with the monovalent, original vaccine,” the FDA’s Doran Fink said during the CDC advisory meeting. That experience made the FDA comfortable extrapolating data from the BA.1 booster trials to decide that the new shots are also safe. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t usually have too much clinical information … when we are thinking about changing influenza vaccines,” said Sarah Long, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. Much like the flu vaccine remodels last season’s version, the updated COVID-19 booster is built on the same scaffolding as the original version. “It’s part of the same roof. We’re just putting in some dormers and windows.”</p>



<p>Pablo Sanchez, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, cast the sole dissenting vote against recommending the BA.4/5 boosters. Other committee members voted to recommend the boosters, but they voiced reservations about those votes.</p>



<p>“I really don’t want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don’t have clinical data on,” Sanchez said. He added, “I’m comfortable that the vaccine will likely be safe like the others,” but having the human data may help counter vaccine hesitancy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamonds-laser-plastic-bottle-planets-physics">Zapping plastic with a laser forged tiny diamonds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A laser blast produces miniature diamonds from plain-old plastic. That’s right, the same kind used in soda bottles.</p>



<p>When squeezed to about a million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure and heated to thousands of degrees Celsius, polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo0617">forms nanodiamonds</a>, physicist Dominik Kraus and colleagues report September 2 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Ice giant planets, such as Neptune and Uranus, have similar temperatures, pressures and combinations of chemical elements as the materials in the study, suggesting that diamonds may rain down in those planets’ interiors. What’s more, the researchers say, the new technique could be used to manufacture nanodiamonds for use in quantum devices and other applications.</p>





<p>In the new study, researchers trained lasers on samples of plastic. Each laser blast sent a shock wave careening through the plastic, amping up the pressure and temperature within. Probing the material with bursts of X-rays revealed that nanodiamonds had formed.</p>



<p>Previous studies had created diamonds by compressing compounds of hydrogen and carbon. But PET, which is commonly used in food and drink packaging, contains not just hydrogen and carbon but also oxygen. That makes it a better match to the composition of ice giant planets like Neptune and Uranus. The oxygen seems to assist the diamond formation, says Kraus, of the University of Rostock in Germany. “The oxygen sucks out the hydrogen,” he says, leaving behind carbon which can then form diamond.</p>



<p>Nanodiamonds are commonly produced using explosives, Kraus says, a process not easy to control. The new technique could create nanodiamonds that are more easily tailored for particular uses, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/designer-diamonds-could-one-day-help-build-quantum-internet">quantum devices made using diamond with defects</a> where, for example, nitrogen atoms replace some of the carbon atoms (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>“The idea is quite cool. You take water bottle plastic; you zap it with a laser to make diamond. How practical it is, I don’t know,” says physicist Marius Millot of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the new study. How easily the diamonds could be recovered is unclear, he says. But, “it’s pretty neat to think about the idea.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruption-deadly-warning-nyiragong-congo">In 2021, a deadly volcano erupted with no warning. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>In May 2021, Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes, burst to life without warning. Lava erupted from fissures and flowed down the mountain toward cities below, leaving hundreds dead or missing and hundreds more injured.</p>



<p>Now, using data from monitoring stations installed near the volcano in 2015, researchers have pieced together <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05047-8">how that eruption happened so suddenly</a>. The data also suggest that the event could have been even deadlier — and highlight the urgent need to better understand this volcano’s particular hazards before the next eruption, volcanologist Delphine Smittarello and colleagues report in the Sept. 1 <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>“Nyiragongo is unique in that 1 million people are living just at the foot of the volcano,” says Smittarello, of the European Center for Geodynamics and Seismology in Luxembourg. The mountain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/studying-volcano-war-zone">sits near the eastern border of Congo</a>, looming over both the Congolese city of Goma, population of about 700,000, and the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, population about 83,000 (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). “There are so many people so close to a very dangerous place.”</p>



<p>Nyiragongo’s last two eruptions, in 1977 and 2002, were both presaged by days of distinct seismic rumblings strong enough to be felt by people living nearby. But before the eruption on May 22, 2021, even the sensitive monitoring stations near the volcano seemed to detect no clear warning signs of magma on the move underground.</p>



<p>There was the large lake of molten lava burbling in the volcano’s summit crater: By 2021, that lake had risen to near the top of the crater. But typically lake level alone isn’t enough to indicate an imminent eruption, Smittarello says. Levels had intermittently risen and fallen over the years since 2002 as magma moved around the volcano’s deep plumbing. And in 2021, the lake was still 85 meters below its 2002 level.</p>



<p>So Smittarello and her colleagues took another look at the monitoring stations’ seismic and acoustic data. This time, the analysis identified a rumbling of small quakes that commenced just 40 minutes before the actual eruption. Half an hour later, just 10 minutes before the lava burst through, detections of acoustic signals — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cotopaxi-volcano-ecuador-infrasound">low-frequency “infrasound” waves</a> — began to increase, a hint that the volcano was about to erupt (<em>SN: 6/25/18</em>).</p>



<p>The trigger for the actual eruption was probably a tiny rupture that formed in the volcanic cone due to the buildup of stress over time from the pressure and heat of the magma within, the researchers say. That would have been enough to allow the magma to push through.</p>



<p>The short lag time between the signals and the eruption was probably because that magma was already extremely close to the surface, the researchers suggest. “What we monitor is the magma moving, not the presence or absence of magma,” Smittarello says. Because the magma had very little distance to travel, there was also very little warning.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The eruption itself lasted about six hours, but in its aftermath, there was plenty of seismic activity lasting another 10 days, suggesting the magma was now on the move. Those data, monitored in real time, indicated something troubling — the magma was moving underground, away from the summit, snaking beneath the city of Goma and nearby Lake Kivu.</p>



<p>As the magma migrated, scientists and local citizens worked together to trace the formation of cracks in the ground, which can indicate propagating dikes, lateral pathways through which magma is moving beneath the surface. Similar lateral pathways formed during the eruption of Kilauea in Hawaii, Smittarello says. In that case, the magma <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilauea-volcano-pyrotechnics-lava-no-signs-stopping">migrated to a neighborhood</a> along the volcano’s lower east rift zone before erupting (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>Based on the possible path of the magma, Goma city officials issued evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people who were potentially in the magma’s path. Meanwhile, scientists anxiously watched for signs of a potential “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cameroons-killer-lakes-rising-threat">limnic eruption</a>” at Lake Kivu — a rare type of disaster in which a noxious cloud of dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and methane suddenly erupts from deep lakes, suffocating living creatures nearby (<em>SN: 4/2/94</em>). Gas-rich magma seeping into the lake&#8217;s bottom could have triggered such an eruption. In either case, “if [the magma] finds a path to the surface, it’s a catastrophe,” Smittarello says.</p>



<p>Neither catastrophe occurred, thankfully, Smittarello says. “It was a lucky situation. But we don’t know why.”</p>



<p>It was especially lucky given the fact that the magma was closer to the surface than thought at the time, the team reports in the new study. That means the residents above were even closer to greater disaster than had been realized.</p>



<p>Reanalysis of posteruptive seismic data let the researchers determine the actual position of the underground dikes. The team found that one dike beneath Goma was as shallow as 450 meters deep. That’s particularly surprising because such a shallow magma channel would be expected to emit a telltale cocktail of volcanic gases from the ground cracks.</p>

<h3>What lies beneath</h3>



<p>In the aftermath of Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo eruption on May 22, 2021,&nbsp; seismic data (black circles) indicated that magma was moving underground away from the volcano’s summit and toward the city of Goma and Lake Kivu. In a new study, researchers used those data to map the extent and width of the dike (widest at the reddest color). To their surprise, they found that it was as shallow as just 450 meters beneath Goma at one point and presented a serious threat.</p>

<p>It’s not unheard-of for volcanic dikes to give no gassy indicators of their presence, says geophysicist Michael Poland of the U.S. Geological Survey, who is based in Vancouver, Wash., and leads the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. The magma may have lost a lot of its gases as it circulated up into the summit lava lake; by the time it pushed into underground channels, it was potentially already degassed.</p>



<p>But that scenario is worrisome because there’s one fewer warning signal of possible danger to the communities above, says Poland, who was not involved in the new study. It also raises new questions — such as how such gas-poor magma might interact with Lake Kivu if it does flow into the lake.</p>



<p>What the 2021 eruption makes clear is that scientists need to investigate such questions to get a better understanding of the peculiarities of Nyiragongo — and to tailor monitoring and hazard warnings accordingly, Poland adds.</p>



<p>All volcanoes have their own personalities, and scientists need to develop a better appreciation for any warning signs that might exist. In this case, for example, that might include the lava lake level, he says. “The traditional approach is less reliable at Nyiragongo.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">Here’s the James Webb telescope’s first direct image of an exoplanet</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is the first picture of an exoplanet from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>“We’re actually measuring photons from the atmosphere of the planet itself,” says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. Seeing those particles of light, “to me, that’s very exciting.”</p>



<p>The planet is about seven times the mass of Jupiter and lies more than 100 times farther from its star than Earth sits from the sun, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14990">direct observations of exoplanet HIP 65426 b</a> show. It’s also young, about 10 million or 20 million years old, compared with the more than 4-billion-year-old Earth, Hinkley and colleagues report in a study submitted August 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>Those three features — size, distance and youth — made HIP 65426 b relatively easy to see, and so a good planet to test JWST’s observing abilities. And the telescope has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">once again surpassed astronomers’ expectations</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve demonstrated really how powerful JWST is as an instrument for the direct imaging of exoplanets,” says exoplanet astronomer and coauthor Aarynn Carter of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>Astronomers have found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">more than 5,000 planets orbiting other stars</a> (<em>SN: 3/22/22</em>). But almost all of those planets were detected indirectly, either by the planets tugging on the stars with their gravity or blocking starlight as they cross between the star and a telescope’s view.</p>



<p>To see a planet directly, astronomers have to block out the light from its star and let the planet’s own light shine, a tricky process. It’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">been</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planets-atmospheres-revealed">done</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-picture-sun-like-star-multiple-exoplanets-astronomy-planets">before</a>, but for only about 20 planets total (<em>SN: 11/13/08; SN: 3/14/13; SN: 7/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>“In every area of exoplanet discovery, nature has been very generous,” says MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager, who was not involved in the JWST discovery. “This is the one area where nature didn’t really come through.”</p>



<p>In 2017, astronomers discovered HIP 65426 b and took a direct image of it using an instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. But because that telescope is on the ground, it can’t see all the light coming from the exoplanet. Earth’s atmosphere absorbs a lot of the planet’s infrared wavelengths — exactly the wavelengths JWST excels at observing. The space telescope observed the planet on July 17 and July 30, capturing its glow in four different infrared wavelengths.</p>



<p>“These are wavelengths of light that we’ve never ever seen exoplanets in before,” Hinkley says. “I’ve literally been waiting for this day for six years. It feels amazing.”</p>



<p>Pictures in these wavelengths will help reveal how planets formed and what their atmospheres are made of.</p>



<p>“Direct imaging is our future,” Seager says. “It’s amazing to see the Webb performing so well.”</p>



<p>While the team has not yet studied the atmosphere of HIP 65426 b in detail, it did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620">report the first spectrum</a> — a measurement of light in a range of wavelengths — of an object orbiting a different star. The spectrum allows a deeper look into the object’s chemistry and atmosphere, astronomer Brittany Miles of UC Santa Cruz and colleagues reported September 1 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>That object is called VHS 1256 b. It’s as heavy as 20 Jupiters, so it may be more like a transition object between a planet and a star, called a brown dwarf, than a giant planet. JWST found evidence that the amounts of carbon monoxide and methane in the atmosphere of the orb are out of equilibrium. That means the atmosphere is getting mixed up, with winds or currents pulling molecules from lower depths to its top and vice versa. The telescope also saw signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brown-dwarf-sand-cloud-atmosphere-space">sand clouds</a>, a common feature in brown dwarf atmospheres (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>).</p>



<p>“This is probably a violent and turbulent atmosphere that is filled with clouds,” Hinkley says.</p>



<p>HIP 65426 b and VHS 1256 b are unlike anything we see in our solar system. They’re more than three times the distance of Uranus from their stars, which suggests they formed in a totally different way from more familiar planets. In future work, astronomers hope to use JWST to image smaller planets that sit closer to their stars.</p>



<p>“What we’d like to do is get down to study Earths, wouldn’t we? We’d really like to get that first image of an Earth orbiting another star,” Hinkley says. That’s probably out of JWST’s reach — Earth-sized planets are still too small see. But a Saturn? That may be something JWST could focus its sights on.&nbsp;</p>

                Global warming is melting Earth’s glaciers, which is moving vast amounts of water—maybe enough to affect the planet’s rotation.
