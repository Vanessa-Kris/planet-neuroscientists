<h3><b><i>‘’</i></b> <b><i>What is one piece of advice you would give to reviewers as an EBM overseeing peer review ?“ </i></b></h3>
<p>Here are their replies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise reviewers to think about how the manuscript at hand could be improved. The ultimate goal is to make published research better, such that the benefit to the public is maximized. I believe this can be achieved by being unbiased, open-minded, and thorough in assessing submitted work”. </span><strong>Dr Christiana Kartsonaki, senior statistician, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat every manuscript like treating your own paper. It’s vital to not only point out defects, but also to appreciate merits in each piece of work. Reviewers are not just making a choice between Accept and Reject. Instead, reviewers could offer valuable suggestions that are to the point and help authors improve the quality of the paper. Reviewers are not the opponents of authors, but teachers and friends who work side-by-side”. </span><strong>Prof Guo-wei Tu, Chief Physician and Associate Professor of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would advise reviewers to only commit to the review process if they have the time and required expertise for the specific manuscript. It is disheartening and inconvenient when reviewers agree to handle a manuscript but then don’t return any comments or provide very little feedback to the authors. The reviewing process should be constructive for the authors and it would be more beneficial if more highly experienced scientists were engaging with this”. </span><strong>Dr Stavroula Kanoni, Lecturer in Nutrigenetics and Cardiovascular Health, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts &amp; the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All reviewers, including me, are expected to abide by the ethical guidelines for peer reviewers published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). They are expected to spend adequate time to avoid missing anything. The history of medicine cannot forget the rejection of Sir Hans Adolf Krebs’ article by a prestigious journal in 1937, where he described the discovery which led him to obtain the Nobel prize. We should not let such egregious or even minor errors at lower scales be repeated”. </span><strong>Prof Elaheh Malakan Rad, Professor of Pediatric Interventional Cardiology, Children’s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would recommend reviewers pay more attention to the content of the paper and the validity of the proposed research rather than focus on the presentation. Some papers are written impeccably, but lack novelty or relevant research. I also suggest taking the right amount of time to review a paper since it is often the result of the authors&#8217; significant effort that must not be disregarded”. </span><strong>Prof Stafano Omboni, Director of the Italian Institute of Telemedicine, Italy and Professor of Cardiology, First Moscow State Medical University, Russia </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reviewers are precious to every Journal because their judgements and comments represent an important part in the review process of a manuscript. For this reason, fulfilling the task of Reviewers requires time and dedication in terms of knowledge and engagement. Exhaustive comments received quickly help the authors progress in their research. I would hence recommend potential Reviewers to take some courses to learn how to become experts in the job. Also our Journal offers some training courses available online”. </span><strong>Dr Aldo Bonaventura, Division of Internal Medicine, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese, Italy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would generally recommend learning how to become an expert in reviewing. This is not an easy task. There are a few training courses available online. We must be focused on both the scientific approach and the manuscript&#8217;s quality. The published data can impair clinical practice and bring suffering to our patients. We are responsible to uphold the faith of the people in public health and must be careful in decision-making to prevent any complications deteriorating our patients&#8217; quality of life”. </span><strong>Dr John Alexander Kharlamov, De Haar Research Task Force, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Tallinn, Estonia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The advice I would give to any reviewer is: accept reviewing a manuscript when you have specific expertise on the topic and the ability to appraise the methods and results presented critically. It is always ok to apologize and decline to review if you are unable to handle a manuscript, or because of conflict of interest. Another critical point is to try to finalize your recommendations in time. We have all been in these situations where our paper&#8217;s decision is delayed because of the one reviewer who did not complete his review. Please do not be that reviewer”. </span><strong>Dr Michael Megaly, Interventional Cardiology Fellow and Clinical Instructor Faculty, Banner University Medical Center and UA College of Medicine-Phoenix, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise a timely and constructive review for an efficient editorial process. Sometimes, the reviewers ignore adding a note to the editor, which might help make editorial decisions”. </span><strong>Dr Gaurav Sharma, early-career researcher, Advanced Imaging Research Centre, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember that reviewing means being at the service of the authors. The first question a reviewer should ask themselves is whether the paper is out of scope or unsuitable for publication in that particular journal. If this is the case, do not delay your decision, as this will only harm the authors’ effort to find the right journal for their work. If the paper and journal are a good (or at least a possible) match, take the time to analyze the paper thoroughly, before making your decision and give feedback that will improve the author’s work”. </span><strong>Dr Claudio Montalto, Cardiology resident, University of Pavia, Italy and Interventional Cardiology Fellow, Oxford University Hospital NHS Trust, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The peer-review process is critical for publishing exciting and authentic scientific findings, and the reviewer&#8217;s role is crucial here. Reviewer&#8217;s comments are the building blocks of the editorial board&#8217;s decision. My advice to all potential reviewers is: accomplish the assignment on time; keep an unbiased approach; provide comprehensive and constructive scientific comments in a friendly manner; highlight the significance of an article you review, thereby helping the associate editor make a final decision; inform the EBM if you cannot handle or understand any specific part of the manuscript, such as statistical and bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, if needed, reviewers should enroll in various training courses available online at various journals, including those available at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, to improve the skills required for best and ethical review practice”. </span><strong>Dr Gourav Bhardwaj, senior research investigator, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, USA</strong></li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/demon-duck-mihirung-australia-bird-fossil">Ancient ‘demon ducks’ may have been undone by their slow growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant flightless birds called mihirungs were the biggest birds to ever stride across what is now Australia. The animals, which weighed up to hundreds of kilograms, died out about 40,000 years ago. Now researchers might have a better idea why.</p>



<p>The birds may have grown and reproduced <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25047">too slowly to withstand</a> pressures from humans’ arrival on the continent, researchers report August 17 in the<em> Anatomical Record</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mihirungs are sometimes called “demon ducks” because of their great size and close evolutionary relationship with present-day waterfowl and game birds. The flightless, plant-eating birds lived for more than 20 million years.</p>





<p>Over that time, some species evolved into titans. Take Stirton’s thunderbird (<em>Dromornis stirtoni</em>). It lived about 7 million years ago, stood 3 meters tall and could exceed 500 kilograms in weight, making it the largest-known mihirung and a contender for the largest bird ever to live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most research on mihirungs has been on their anatomy and evolutionary relationships with living birds. Little is known about the animals’ biology, such as how long they took to grow and mature, says Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a paleobiologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Chinsamy-Turan and colleagues at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia took samples from 20 fossilized leg bones of<em> D. stirtoni</em>, from animals of varying life stages.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="513" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline.jpg" alt="Paleontologist Trevor Worthy holding a giant fossilized leg bone in one hand and an emu leg bone, visibly much smaller, in the other hand, while standing in an office" class="wp-image-3116726" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline-508x383.jpg 508w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline-596x450.jpg 596w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline-247x186.jpg 247w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082622_jb_demon-ducks_inline-263x197.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116726">Paleontologist and study coauthor &nbsp;Trevor Worthy displays a fossilized leg bone of the “demon duck” <em>Dromornis stirtoni</em> (left) and a modern emu’s leg bone (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116726">Flinders Univ.</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Even after millions of years of fossilization, the microscopic structure of fossil bones generally remains intact,” and it can be used to decipher important clues about extinct animals’ biology, Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team examined the thin bone slices under a microscope, detailing the presence or absence of growth marks. These marks provide information on how fast the bone grew while the birds were alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>D. stirtoni</em> took 15 years or more to reach full size, the team found. It probably became sexually mature a few years before that, based on the timing of a shift from rapidly growing bone to a slower-growing form that’s thought to be associated with reaching reproductive age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results differ from the team’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/5/219/htm">earlier analysis</a> of the bones of another mihirung, <em>Genyornis newtoni</em>. That species — the last-known mihirung — was less than half the size of <em>D. stirtoni</em>. It lived as recently as about 40,000 years ago and was a contemporary of the continent’s earliest human inhabitants. <em>G. newtoni</em> grew up much faster than its giant relative, reaching adult size in one to two years and growing a bit more in the following years and possibly reproducing then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difference in how fast mihirung species that were separated by millions of years developed may have been an evolved response to Australia developing a drier, more variable climate over the last few million years, the researchers say. When resources are unpredictable, growing and reproducing quickly can be advantageous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, that seeming pep in the developmental step of more recent mihirungs was still slower than that of the emus they lived alongside. Emus grow up quickly, reaching adult size in less than a year and reproducing not long after, laying large numbers of eggs.</p>



<p>This difference may explain why <em>G. newtoni</em> went extinct shortly after hungry humans arrived in Australia, yet emus continue to thrive today, the team says. Even though over millions of years, mihirungs as a group seem to have adapted to growing and reproducing quicker than they used to, it wasn’t enough to survive the arrival of humans, who probably ate the birds and their eggs, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“Slowly growing animals face dire consequences in terms of their reduced ability to recover from threats in their environments,” Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientists’ research on other giant, extinct, flightless birds thought to have met their end thanks to humans — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-reveal-what-it-was-grow-dodo">dodos of Mauritius</a> (<em>Raphus cucullatus</em>) and the largest of Madagascar’s elephant birds (<em>Vorombe titan</em>) — shows that they too grew relatively slowly (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/29/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is very interesting to see this pattern repeating again and again with many large, flightless bird groups,” says Thomas Cullen, a paleoecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>Modern ratite birds seem to be the exception in their ability to handle similar pressures, he says. Other ratites besides emus that have survived until the present day — such as cassowaries and ostriches — also grow and reproduce quickly (<em>SN: 4/25/14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">Physicists dispute a claim of detecting a black hole’s ‘photon ring’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first image of a black hole may conceal treasure — but physicists disagree about whether it’s been found.</p>



<p>A team of scientists say they’ve unearthed a photon ring, a thin halo of light around the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87. If real, the photon ring would provide a new probe of the black hole’s intense gravity. But other scientists dispute the claim. Despite multiple news headlines suggesting the photon ring has been found, many physicists remain unconvinced.</p>





<p>Unveiled in 2019 by scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a> revealed a doughnut-shaped glow from hot matter swirling around the black hole’s dark silhouette (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). But according to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a thinner ring should be superimposed on that thick doughnut. This ring is produced by photons, or particles of light, that orbit close to the black hole, slung around by the behemoth’s gravity before escaping and zinging toward Earth.</p>



<p>Thanks to this circumnavigation, the photons should provide “a fingerprint of gravity,” more clearly revealing the black hole’s properties, says astrophysicist Avery Broderick of the University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. He and his colleagues, a subset of scientists from the EHT collaboration, used a new method to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7c1d">tease out that fingerprint</a>, they report in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Creating images with EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">isn’t a simple point-and-shoot affair</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Researchers stitch together data from EHT’s squad of observatories scattered across the globe, using various computational techniques to reconstruct an image. Broderick and colleagues created a new black hole image assuming it featured both a diffuse emission and a thin ring. On three out of four days of observations, the data better matched an image with the added thin ring than one without the ring.</p>



<p>But that method has drawn harsh criticism. “The claim of a photon ring detection is preposterous,” says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>A main point of contention: The photon ring is brighter than expected, emitting around 60 percent of the light in the image. According to predictions, it should be more like 20 percent. “That’s a giant red flag,” says physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. More light should come from the black hole’s main glowing doughnut than from the thin photon ring.</p>



<p>This unexpected brightness, Broderick and colleagues say, occurs because some of the light from the main glow gets lumped in with the photon ring. So the ring’s apparent brightness doesn’t depend only on the light coming from the ring. The researchers note that the same effect appeared when testing the method on simulated data.</p>



<p>But that mishmash of purported photon ring light with other light doesn’t make for a very convincing detection, critics say. “If you want to claim that you’ve seen a photon ring, I think you have to do a better job than this,” says astrophysicist Dan Marrone of the University of Arizona, a member of the EHT collaboration who was not a coauthor on the new paper.</p>



<p>The new result suggests only that an added thin ring gives a better match to the data, Marrone says, not whether that shape is associated with the photon ring. So it raises the question of whether scientists are seeing a photon ring at all, or just picking out an unrelated structure in the image.</p>



<p>But Broderick argues that the features of the ring — the fact that its size and location are as expected and are consistent day-to-day — support the photon ring interpretation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a similar, independent analysis, Gralla and physicist Will Lockhart, also of the University of Arizona, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09989">find no evidence for a photon ring,</a> they report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org. Their analysis differed from Broderick and colleagues’ in part because it limited how bright the photon ring could be.</p>



<p>To convincingly detect the photon ring, some scientists propose adding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-could-help-spot-photon-ring-black-hole-ever-imaged">telescopes in space</a> to the EHT’s crew of observatories (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). The farther apart the telescopes in the network are, the finer details they may be able to pick out — potentially including the photon ring.</p>



<p>“If there were a photon ring detection,” Lupsasca says, “that would be the best thing in physics this year, if not for many years.”</p>

But how do the various environments and ever changing conditions faced by these small cetacean impact their genetic diversity and have they adapted to their specific environment? This <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution </em>seascape genomic study uses genome wide and environmental data at the population level to look at selective pressure, adaptive population structure and population diversity in the common dolphin in southern Australia. Four key variables are identified to have an impact on genomic variation:  sea surface temperature, primary productivity, current velocity and salinity. These data can in turn help to inform on the impact of specific factors such as pollution and assist in the conservation efforts. This study lead to the identification of five populations of common dolphin to be considered as priority for population management and conservation. As a near top predator, dolphins are key players in their environments and a vital part of the food chain. Thus, impacts from anthropogenic activities such as fisheries or climatic disruptions on dolphin populations could have long standing effects on the whole of the marine ecosystem.</p>

Glyphosate is a weak organic acid, often supplemented by adjuvants to increase its herbicidal properties. It is generally composed of an isopropylamine salt and a surfactant that is toxic to humans. Upon entrance into the body, Glyphosate is absorbed through the cell membrane and enters the bloodstream eventually spreading to the tissues and organs before being excreted by the body, primarily through urination and defecation.  Primary exposure to Glyphosate is through the skin and respiratory system while using herbicides and it has been linked to various illnesses, especially respiratory system afflictions. This <em>BMC Public Health </em>longitudinal pre-post study was conducted in maize farmer in Thailand using information from questionnaires, urine, blood samples and lung function assessment a day before and a day after glyphosate usage. As expected, exposure to glyphosate had negative impacts on oxidative stress, inflammation and lung function.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress can cause damage to cells and tissues and thus impact the body leading to increased inflammation. One of the by-product of oxidative damage is the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Upon oxidative stress, cells defend themselves by producing antioxidants in order to destroy damaging free radicals. Glutathione (GHS) plays a vital role in this process and acts to protect cells from oxidative stress. Glyphosate was shown to negatively impact the regulation of oxidative stress at different levels as exposure to glyphosate was shown to lead to a significant increase in the level of serum MDA and oxidative stress as well as a significant decrease in serum level of GHS. Furthermore, a statistically significant increase in inflammation was identified after glyphosate exposure as well as an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation which increases upon tissue injury, causes monocyte activation as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of complement. Last but not least, lung function was significantly decreased after application of glyphosate.</p>
<p>This study focused on the short term effects of acute exposure thus further studies on the long-term effect of glyphosate exposure are warranted.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of microbiome studies, little is known about the impact of the presence of bacterial DNA in human blood and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The association between chronic diseases and CVD has been extensively studied and a number of risk factors are known to be associated an increase in CVD mortality such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, physical activity, history of heart diseases etc… In this <em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em> case-cohort study spanning over nearly 10 years, blood samples from men of a mean age of 70 were collected and their microbiome analysed in order to investigate a putative association with CVD mortality. Over 80% of the blood samples collected contained bacterial DNA from a whole range of bacteria originating from the gut, skin, oral cavity or the environment. Three genera were significantly associated with CVD mortality but the two most prevalent genera isolated, <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> were not and are part of the commensal microbiota.  The presence of two genera in blood, <em>Kocuria</em> and <em>Enhydrobacter</em>, was associated with an increased CVD mortality whereas it was the opposite for the third genera, <em>Paracoccus</em>. Interestingly, these correlations were identified independently of other know health and lifestyle risk factors for CVD mortality. This study reflects on the risk through a lifetime as it looks at older men and it will be useful to inform on of which genera to pursue in future research projects.</p>

This condition was traditionally diagnosed upon observation of an increase in blood pressure and high level of proteins in urine. Recent studies have found an association between temperature and the risk of preeclampsia. Indeed, it has now been shown that the risk of preeclampsia increases for women who have conceived in warmth months and delivered in cold months based on the study of seasonal or monthly temperature data. In this <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> study, the effect of short-term temperature exposure on the risk of preeclampsia was investigated using daily temperature data. The authors reported that there was a significantly larger number of hospital admissions for preeclampsia on cold days than on hot ones. Indeed, the highest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was observed on days where the mean temperature was lower than 10°C. Furthermore, the lowest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was on days where the mean temperature was higher than 30°C. The lag effect of low temperature preeclampsia risk was also identified as a significant risk factor.  Thus the recommendation was that in low temperature, pregnant women should stay warm and pay attention to their blood pressure and go to the hospital if it raises. This information could be used in order for governments to increase publicity on the impact of low temperature on the risk of preeclampsia and thus help to reduce that risk.</p>

Thus their inhabitants have had to develop strategies to adapt to such fluctuations. This <em>BMC Genomics</em> study set out to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for the strong salinity tolerance of <em>Scatophagus argus</em>, the spotted cat fish, a recently developed mariculture specie by looking at differentially expressed proteins. They uncovered that cellular ion regulation transport as well as ATP synthesis are key players in the osmoregulatory process of its specialised gills that act as the main osmoregulatory organ. These gills have developed different strategies to enable the fish to adapt to different salinity level. Under hypo saline conditions, Na+ efflux is maintained through Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) increased activity leading to a reduction in the intracellular osmotic pressure. Simultaneously, an increased NKA internalisation prevents excessive ion loss. Upon hypersaline stress, excess ions are excreted through active transport and reduced NKA activity resulting in an increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Thus this fish has developed different osmoregulatory strategies in order to handle hypoosmotic as well as hyperosmotic stresses and thus adapt to an environment subject to large fluctuations in salinity levels. These result provide valuable insights on <em>Scatophagus argus</em> and the strategies used by estuarine fishes that should prove helpful to the expansion of commercial aquaculture.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-infection-471-days-coronavirus-evolution-variants">The curious case of the 471-day coronavirus infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>As <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron subvariant BA.5</a> continues to drive the coronavirus’ spread in the United States, I’ve been thinking about what could come next. Omicron and its offshoots have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed.">topping the variant charts</a> since last winter. Before that, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta reigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have a few ideas for how new variants emerge. One involves people with persistent infections — people who test positive for the virus over a prolonged period of time. I’m going to tell you about the curious case of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 for at least 471 days and what can happen when infections roil away uncontrolled.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That lengthy infection first came onto epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh&#8217;s radar in the summer of 2021. His team had been analyzing coronavirus strains in patient samples from Yale New Haven Hospital when Grubaugh spotted something he had seen before. Known only as B.1.517, this version of the virus never got a name like delta or omicron, nor rampaged through communities quite like its infamous relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after springing up somewhere in North America in early 2020, B.1.517 tooled around in a handful of regions around the world, even sparking an outbreak in Australia. But after April 2021, B.1.517 seemed to sputter, one of the who-knows-how-many viral lineages that flare up and then eventually fizzle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.1.517 might have been long forgotten, shouldered aside by the latest variant to stake a claim in local communities. “And yet we were still seeing it,” Grubaugh says. Even after B.1.517 had petered out across the country, his team noticed it cropping up in patient samples. The same lineage, every few weeks, like clockwork, for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One clue was the samples’ specimen ID. The code on the B.1.517 samples was always the same, Grubaugh’s team noticed. They had all come from a single patient.</p>



<p>That patient, a person in their 60s with a history of cancer, relapsed in November of 2020. That was right around when they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After seeing B.1.517 show up again and again in their samples, Grubaugh worked with a clinician to get the patient’s permission to analyze their data.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />for our latest preprint on the intrahost evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in an immunocompromised individual (60s) with a history of cancer chronically infected for at least 471 days (ongoing) with consistently replicating viruses at a high viral load. 1/n<a href="https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt">https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt</a></p>&mdash; Chrispin Chaguza (@ChrispinChaguza) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrispinChaguza/status/1543730086658056192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ultimately, the patient has <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.22276868v1.full">remained infected for 471 days</a> (and counting), Grubaugh, Yale postdoctoral researcher Chrispin Chaguza and their team reported last month in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Because of deteriorating health and a desire to maintain their anonymity, the patient was not willing to be interviewed, and Grubaugh has no direct contact with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all those samples collected over all those days told an incredible tale of viral evolution. Over about 15 months, at least three genetically distinct versions of the virus had rapidly evolved inside the patient, the team’s analyses suggested.</p>



<p>Each version had dozens of mutations and seemed to coexist in the patient’s body. “Honestly, if any one of these were to emerge in a population and begin transmitting, we would be calling it a new variant,” Grubaugh says.</p>



<p>That scenario is probably rare, he says. After all, lots of prolonged infections have likely occurred during the pandemic, and only a handful of concerning variants have emerged. But the work does suggest that persistent viral infections can provide a playground for speedy evolutionary experimentation — perhaps taking advantage of weakened immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grubaugh’s work is “probably the most detailed look we’ve had at a single, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 so far,” says Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved with the work.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>The study supports an earlier finding about a different immunocompromised patient — one with a persistent <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.22275533v1">omicron infection</a>. In that work, researchers documented the evolution of the virus over 12 weeks and showed that its descendant infected at least five other people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the studies lay out how such infections could potentially drive the emergence of the next omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am pretty well convinced that people with persistent infection are important sources of new variants,” Friedrich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who exactly develops these infections remains mysterious. Yes, the virus can pummel people with weakened immune systems, but “not every immunocompromised person develops a persistent infection,” says Viviana Simon, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who worked on the omicron infection study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, doctors and scientists have no idea how common these infections are. “We just don’t really have the numbers,” Simon says. That’s a huge gap for researchers, and something Mount Sinai’s <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/research/microbial-genomics-pathogen-surveillance">Pathogen Surveillance Program</a> is trying to address by analyzing real-time infection data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying patients with prolonged infections could also tell scientists where SARS-CoV-2 evolution is heading, Friedrich says. Just because the virus evolves within a person doesn’t mean it will spread to other people. But if certain viral mutations tend to arise in multiple people with persistent infections, that could hint that the next big variant might evolve in a similar way. Knowing more about these mutation patterns could help researchers forecast what’s to come, an important step in designing future coronavirus vaccine boosters.</p>

<p>Beyond viral forecasting, Grubaugh says identifying people with prolonged infections is important so doctors can provide care. “We need to give them access to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs,” he says. Those treatments could help patients clear their infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identifying persistent infections is easier said than done, he points out. Many places in the world aren’t set up to spot these infections and don’t have access to vaccines or treatments. And even when these are available, some patients opt out. The patient in Grubaugh’s study received a monoclonal antibody infusion about 100 days into their infection, then refused all other treatments. They have not been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the patient remained infectious over the course of the study, their variants never spread to the community, as far as Grubaugh knows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while untreated chronic infections might spawn new variants, they could emerge in other ways, too, like from animals infected with the virus, from person-to-person transmission in groups of people scientists haven’t been monitoring, or from “something else that maybe none of us has thought of yet,” he says. “SARS-CoV-2 has continued to surprise us with its evolution.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-anus-saccorhytus-coronarius-evolution">This bizarre ancient critter has been kicked out of a group that includes humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>No ifs, ands or butts about it: A teeny roughly 530-million-year-old critter that lacks an anus is not, as previously thought, the oldest member of a wide-ranging animal group that includes everything from starfish to humans.</p>



<p>Despite its absent anus, <em>Saccorhytus coronarius</em> had no shortage of holes on its wrinkly potato-shaped body, including a ring of small openings around its gaping mouth. Previously, those holes had been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinhead-sized-sea-creature-was-bag-mouth">identified as an early version of gill slits</a>, typically used for respiration (<em>SN: 2/3/17</em>). Gill slits are commonly found in deuterostomes, so their presence seemingly nailed the critter’s spot on the animal family tree.</p>





<p>But a new 3-D reconstruction of the half-millimeter-long species based on fossil imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05107-z">shows those holes are instead remnants of broken spines</a>, researchers report August 17 in <em>Nature</em>. The identification of the spines helped shift the creature into a group with arthropods and nematodes, called Ecdysozoa.</p>



<p>After millions of years, fossils can look very different from the original specimens, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">makes it challenging to identify biological features</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/22</em>). Most <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils have been flattened “like a very sad balloon that&#8217;s collapsed in on itself,” says paleontologist Philip Donoghue of the University of Bristol in England. The 3-D reconstruction brings <em>S. coronarius</em> to life — even if it does look something like an angry minion, he says.</p>



<p>Donoghue and his colleagues took X-rays of many <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils representing different stages of the organisms’ decay. The images revealed that an inner skin layer once pushed through pores and extended outward, forming spines. During fossilization, that inner layer was lost, and the holes were left behind.</p>



<p>While the spines pretty much lock <em>S. coronarius </em>into its new group, a puzzle remains: the absent anus. It’s not inherently weird —&nbsp;the absence has evolved independently in many species such as jellyfish, which vomit their food waste. But both deuterostomes and ecdysozoans usually have anuses, making <em>S. coronarius </em>an uncomfortable fit in either group.</p>



<p>Still, “if you haven&#8217;t got an anus,” Donoghue jokes, “you&#8217;re not going to be very comfortable anywhere.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">The Tonga eruption may have spawned a tsunami as tall as the Statue of Liberty</a></h4>

              
                <p>The massive Tonga eruption generated a set of planet-circling tsunamis that may have started out as a single mound of water roughly the height of the Statue of Liberty.</p>



<p>What’s more, the explosive eruption triggered an immense atmospheric shock wave that spawned <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822014810">a second set of especially fast-moving tsunamis</a>, a rare phenomenon that can complicate early warnings for these oft-destructive waves, researchers report in the October <em>Ocean Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano erupted</a> in the South Pacific in January, it displaced a large volume of water upward, says Mohammad Heidarzadeh, a civil engineer at the University of Bath in England (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). The water in that colossal mound later “ran downhill,” as fluids tend to do, to generate the initial set of tsunamis.</p>





<p>To estimate the original size of the mound, Heidarzadeh and his team used computer simulations, as well as data from deep-ocean instruments and coastal tide gauges within about 1,500 kilometers of the eruption, many of them in or near New Zealand. The arrival times of tsunami waves, as well as their sizes, at those locations were key pieces of data, Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>The team analyzed nine possibilities for the initial wave, each of which was shaped like a baseball pitcher’s mound and had a distinct height and diameter. The best fit to the real-world data came from a mound of water a whopping 90 meters tall and 12 kilometers in diameter, the researchers report.</p>



<p>That initial wave would have contained an estimated 6.6 cubic kilometers of water. “This was a really large tsunami,” Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>Despite starting out about nine times as tall as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-waves-2">the tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region of Japan</a> in 2011, the Tongan tsunamis killed only five people and caused about $90 million in damage, largely because of their remote source (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>).</p>



<p>Another unusual aspect of the Tongan eruption is the second set of tsunamis generated by a strong atmospheric pressure wave.</p>



<p>That pressure pulse resulted from a steam explosion that occurred when a large volume of seawater infiltrated the hot magma chamber beneath the erupting volcano. As the pressure wave raced across the ocean’s surface at speeds exceeding 300 meters per second, it pushed water ahead of it, creating tsunamis, Heidarzadeh explains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082522_sp_tonga-explosion_inline1.gif" alt="animation showing the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and the accompanying pressure wave, like a huge ripple" class="wp-image-3116693" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116693">The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano also triggered an atmospheric pressure wave that in turn generated tsunamis that traveled quicker than expected.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116693">NASA Earth Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Along many coastlines, including some in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, these pressure wave–generated tsunamis arrived hours ahead of the gravity-driven waves spreading from the 90-meter-tall mound of water. Gravity-driven tsunami waves typically travel across the deepest parts of the ocean, far from continents, at speeds between 100 and 220 meters per second. When the waves reach shallow waters near shore, the waves slow, water stacks up and then strikes shore, where destruction occurs.</p>



<p>Pressure wave–generated tsunamis have been reported for only one other volcanic eruption: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/krakatau-1883-shock-felt-round-world">the 1883 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/83</em>).</p>



<p>Those quicker-than-expected arrival times — plus the fact that the pressure-wave tsunamis for the Tongan eruption were comparable in size with the gravity-driven ones — could complicate early warnings for these tsunamis. That’s concerning, Heiderzadeh says.</p>



<p>One way to address the issue would be to install instruments that measure atmospheric pressure with the deep-sea equipment already in place to detect tsunamis, says Hermann Fritz, a tsunami scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>With that setup, scientists would be able to discern if a passing tsunami is associated with a pressure pulse, thus providing a clue in real time about how fast the tsunami wave might be traveling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">COVID-19 gave new urgency to the science of restoring smell</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the juice that tipped him off. At lunch, Ícaro de A.T. Pires found the flavor of his grape juice muted, flattened into just water with sugar. There was no grape goodness. “I stopped eating lunch and went to the bathroom to try to smell the toothpaste and shampoo,” says Pires, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Hospital IPO in Curitiba, Brazil. “I realized then that I couldn’t smell anything.”</p>



<p>Pires was about three days into COVID-19 symptoms when his sense of smell vanished, an absence that left a mark on his days. On a trip to the beach two months later, he couldn’t smell the sea. “This was always a smell that brought me good memories and sensations,” Pires says. “The fact that I didn’t feel it made me realize how many things in my day weren’t as fun as before. Smell can connect to our emotions like no other sense can.”<br><br>As SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, ripped across the globe, it stole the sense of smell away from millions of people, leaving them with a condition called anosmia. Early in the pandemic, when Pires’ juice turned to water, that olfactory theft became one of the quickest ways to signal a COVID-19 infection. With time, most people who lost smell recover the sense. Pires, for one, has slowly regained a large part of his sense of smell. But that’s not the case for everyone.</p>





<p>About 5.6 percent of people with post–COVID-19 smell loss (or the closely related taste loss) are still <a></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-069503">not able to smell or taste normally six months later</a>, a recent analysis of 18 studies suggests. The number, reported in the July 30 <em>British Medical Journal</em>, seems small. But when considering the estimated 550 million cases and counting of COVID-19 around the world, it adds up.</p>



<p>Scientists are searching for ways to hasten olfactory healing. Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have a better idea of how many people are affected and how long it seems to last. Yet when it comes to ways to rewire the sense of smell, the state of the science isn’t coming up roses.</p>



<p>A method called olfactory training, or smell training, has shown promise, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom. The technique has been around for a while; the coronavirus isn’t the first ailment to snatch away smell. But with newfound pressure from people affected by COVID-19, olfactory training and a host of other newer treatments are now getting a lot more attention.</p>



<p>The pandemic has brought increased attention to smell loss. “If we have to provide a silver lining, COVID is pushing the science at a speed that’s never happened before,” says Valentina Parma, an olfactory researcher and assistant director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “But,” she cautions, “we are really far from a solution.”</p>



<h4>Nasal attack</h4>



<p>Compared with sight or hearing, the sense of smell can seem like an afterthought. But losing it can affect people deeply. “Your world really changes if you lose the sense of smell, in ways that are usually worse,” Parma says. The smell of a baby’s head, a buttery curry or the sharp salty sea can all add emotional meaning to experiences. Smells can also warn of danger, such as the rotten egg stench that signals a natural gas leak.</p>



<p>As an ear, nose and throat doctor, Pires recalls a deaf patient who lost her sense of smell after COVID-19 and enrolled in a clinical trial that he and colleagues conducted on smell training. She worked in a perfumery company — her sense of smell was crucial to her job and her life. “At the first appointment, she said, with tears in her eyes, that it felt like she wasn’t living,” Pires recalls.</p>



<p>Unlike the cells that detect color or sound, the cells that sense smell can replenish themselves. Stem cells in the nose are constantly pumping out new smell-sensing cells. Called olfactory sensory neurons, these cells are dotted with molecular nets that snag specific odor molecules that waft into the nose. Once activated, these cells send messages through the skull and into the brain.</p>



<p>Because of their nasal neighborhood, olfactory sensory neurons are exposed to the hazards of the environment. “They may be covered with a little layer of mucus, but they’re sitting out there being constantly bombarded with bacteria and viruses and pollutants and who knows what else,” says Steven Munger, a chemosensory neuroscientist at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville.</p>



<p>Exactly how SARS-CoV-2 damages the smell system isn’t clear. But recent studies suggest the virus’s assault is indirect. The virus can infect and kill nose support cells called sustentacular cells, which are thought to help keep olfactory neurons happy and fed by delivering glucose and maintaining the right salt balance. That attack can inflame the olfactory epithelium, the layers of cells that line parts of the nasal cavity.</p>



<p>Once this tissue is riled up, the olfactory sensory neurons <a></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00135-0">get wonky</a>, even though the cells themselves haven’t been attacked. After an infection and ensuing inflammation, these neurons slow down the production of their odor-catching nets, a decrease that could blind themselves to odor molecules, scientists reported in the March 17 <em>Cell</em>.</p>



<p>With time, the inflammation settles down, and the olfactory sensory neurons can get back to their usual jobs, researchers suspect. “We do think that for post-viral smell disorders, the most common way to recover function is going to be spontaneous recovery,” Munger says. But in some people, this process doesn’t happen quickly, if ever.</p>



<p>That’s where smell training comes in.</p>



<h4>A nose workout</h4>



<p>One of the only therapies that exists, smell training is quite simple — a good old-fashioned nose workout. It involves deeply smelling four scents (usually rose, eucalyptus, lemon and cloves) for 30 seconds apiece, twice a day for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one study, 40 people who had smell disorders came away from the training with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.20101">improved smelling abilities</a>, on average, compared with 16 people who didn’t do the training, olfactory researcher Thomas Hummel and his colleagues reported in the March 2009 <em>Laryngoscope</em>.</p>



<p>Since then, the bulk of studies has shown that the method helps between 30 and 60 percent of the people who try it, says Hummel, of Technische Universität Dresden in Germany. His view is that the method can help some people, “but it does not work in everybody.”</p>



<p>One of the nice things is that there are no harmful side effects, Hummel says. That’s “the charming side of it.” But to do the training correctly takes discipline and stamina. “If you don’t do it regularly, and you give up after 14 days, this is futile,” he says.</p>



<p>Pires in his recent trial had hoped to speed up the process, which usually takes three months, by adding four more odors to the regimen. For four weeks, 80 participants received either four or eight smells. Both groups improved, but <a></a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19458924221113124">there was no difference between the two groups</a>, the researchers reported July 21 in the <em>American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not known how the technique works in the people it seems to help. It could be that it focuses people’s attention on faint smells; it could be stimulating the growth of replacement cells; it could be strengthening some pathways in the brain. Data from other animals suggest that such training can increase the number of olfactory sensory neurons, Hummel says.</p>



<p>Overall, this nose boot camp may be a possible approach for people to try, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom, Munger says. “In my view, it’s very important to be up front with patients about the very real possibility this therapy may not lead to a restoration of smell, even if they and their doctor feel it is worth trying,” he says. “I am not trying to discourage people here, but I also think we need to be very careful not to give unwarranted promises.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smell training doesn’t come with harmful biological side effects, but it can induce frustration if it doesn’t work, Parma says. In her practice, “I have been talking to a lot of people who say, ‘I did it every day for six months, twice a day for 10 minutes. I met in groups with other people, so we kept each other accountable, and I did that for six months. And it didn’t work for me.’” She adds, “I would want to address the frustration that this induces in patients.”</p>



<h4>Beyond training</h4>



<p>Other potential treatments are coming under scrutiny, such as steroids, omega-3 supplements, growth factors and vitamins A and E, all of which might encourage the recovery of the nasal epithelium.</p>



<p>More futuristic remedies are also in early stages of research. These include epithelial transplants designed to boost olfactory stem cells, treatments with platelet-rich plasma to curb inflammation and promote healing, and even an “electronic nose” that would detect odor molecules and stimulate the brain directly. This cyborg-smelling system takes inspiration from cochlear implants for hearing and retinal implants for vision.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Selling smell short</h3>



<p>People routinely undervalue the sense of smell. Some people rated the ability to smell as less important than various creature comforts, hair and even the little left toe, a recent survey found.</p>

<p>For many people, the sense of smell is appreciated only after it’s gone, Parma says, an apathy that’s illustrated in stark terms by a recent study of about 400 people. The vast majority of respondents — nearly 85 percent — would rather give up their sense of smell than sight or hearing. About 19 percent of respondents said they would prefer to give up their sense of smell than their cell phone. The survey results “dramatically illustrate the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/3">negligible value</a> people place on their sense of smell,” researchers wrote in the March <em>Brain Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Even as a doctor who treats people with smell loss, Pires has a newfound fondness for a good whiff. “Having lost it for a while made me appreciate it even more.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-atmosphere">The James Webb telescope spotted CO2 in an exoplanet’s atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has gotten the first sniff of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet in another solar system.</p>



<p>“It’s incontrovertible. It’s there. It’s definitely there,” says planetary scientist and study coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “There have been hints of carbon dioxide in previous observations, but never confirmed to such an extent.”</p>



<p>The finding, submitted to arXiv.org on August 24, marks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11692">the first detailed scientific result published from the new telescope</a>. It also points the way to finding the same greenhouse gas in the atmospheres of smaller, rockier planets that are more like Earth.</p>





<p>The planet, dubbed WASP-39b, is huge and puffy. It’s a bit wider than Jupiter and about as massive as Saturn. And it orbits its star every four Earth days, making it scorching hot. Those features make it a terrible place to search for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">evidence of extraterrestrial life</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>). But that combination of puffy atmosphere and frequent passes in front of its star makes it easy to observe, a perfect planet to put the new telescope through its paces.</p>



<p>James Webb, or JWST, launched in December 2021 and released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first images in July 2022</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). For about eight hours in July, the telescope observed starlight that filtered through the planet’s thick atmosphere as the planet crossed between its star and JWST. As it did, molecules of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbed specific wavelengths of that starlight. </p>



<p>Previous observations of WASP-39b with NASA’s now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope had detected just a whiff of absorption at that same wavelength. But it wasn’t enough to convince astronomers that carbon dioxide was really there.</p>



<p>“I would not have bet more than a beer, at most a six pack, on that weird tentative hint of carbon dioxide from Spitzer,” says astronomer Nicolas Cowan of McGill University in Montreal, who was not involved with the new study. The JWST detection, on the other hand, “is rock solid,” he says. “I wouldn’t bet my firstborn because I love him too much. But I would bet a nice vacation.”</p>



<p>The JWST data also showed an extra bit of absorption at wavelengths close to those absorbed by carbon dioxide. “It’s a mystery molecule,” says astronomer Natalie Batalha of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the team behind the observation. “We have several suspects that we are interrogating.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Carbon dioxide bump</h3>



<p>The spectrum of light that filtered through the atmosphere of exoplanet WASP-39 b shows strong evidence for containing carbon dioxide. The large bump in the middle of the spectrum shows that the planet’s atmosphere absorbed light with wavelengths around 4.3 micrometers — a clear sign of CO<sub>2</sub>. A smaller bump (shown as three dots above the best-fit line) to the left of the CO<sub>2</sub>, around 4 micrometers, could represent a mystery molecule.</p>

<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet’s atmosphere can reveal details about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">how the planet formed</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>). If the planet was bombarded with asteroids, that could have brought in more carbon and enriched the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. If radiation from the star stripped away some of the planet atmosphere’s lighter elements, that could make it appear richer in carbon dioxide too.</p>



<p>Despite needing a telescope as powerful as JWST to detect it, carbon dioxide might be in atmospheres all over the galaxy, hiding in plain sight. “Carbon dioxide is one of the few molecules that is present in the atmospheres of all solar system planets that have atmospheres,” Batalha says. “It’s your front-line molecule.”</p>



<p>Eventually, astronomers hope to use JWST to find carbon dioxide and other molecules in the atmospheres of small rocky planets, like the ones <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trappist-1-earth-sized-planets-top-science-stories-2017-yir">orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). Some of those planets, at just the right distances from their star to sustain liquid water, might be good places to look for signs of life. It&#8217;s yet to be seen whether JWST will detect those signs of life, but it will be able to detect carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“My first thought when I saw these data was, ‘Wow, this is gonna work,’” Batalha says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deaths-head-hawkmoths-fly-migration-navigate-dark-airplane">How death’s-head hawkmoths manage to fly straight for miles in the dark</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sitting alone in the cockpit of a small biplane, Martin Wikelski listens for the pings of a machine by his side. The sonic beacons help the ecologist stalk death’s-head hawkmoths (<em>Acherontia</em> <em>atropos</em>) fluttering across the dark skies above Konstanz, Germany —&nbsp;about 80 kilometers north of the Swiss Alps.</p>



<p>The moths, nicknamed for the skull-and-crossbones pattern on their backs, migrate thousands of kilometers between northern Africa and the Alps during the spring and fall. Many migratory insects go where the wind takes them, says Ring Carde, an entomologist at the University of California, Riverside who is not a member of Wikelski’s team. Death’s-head hawkmoths appear to be anything but typical.</p>



<p>“When I follow them with a plane, I use very little gas,” says Wikelski, of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Munich. “That shows me that they are supposedly choosing directions or areas that are probably supported by a little bit of updraft.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="360" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2.jpg" alt="map showing the path Martin Wikelski in his plane as he tracked a death’s-head hawkmoth migrating south across the Alps from Germany" class="wp-image-3116622" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2-330x175.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116622">The purple line marks the path ecologist Martin Wikelski followed in his biplane as he tracked a death’s-head hawkmoth migrating south from Kostanz, Germany, into the Alps.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116622">Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A new analysis of data collected from 14 death’s-head hawkmoths suggest that these insects indeed pilot themselves, possibly relying in part on an internal compass attuned to Earth’s magnetic field. The moths not only <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn1663">fly along a straight path</a>, they also stay the course even when winds change, Wikelski and colleagues report August 11 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The findings could help predict how the moths’ flight paths might shift as the globe continues warming, Wikelski says. Like many animals, death’s-head hawkmoths will probably move north in search of cooler temperatures, he suspects.</p>



<p>To keep tabs on the moths, Wikelski’s team glued radio transmitters to their backs, which is easier to do than one might expect. “Death’s-head hawkmoths are totally cool,” Wikelski says. They’re also huge. Weighing as much as three jellybeans, the moths are the largest in Europe. That makes attaching the tiny tags a cinch, though the moths don’t like it very much. “They talk to you, they shout at you a little bit,” he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1.jpg" alt="close-up image of a death’s-head hawkmoth as a researcher places a tracker on its back" class="wp-image-3116623" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116623">Researchers tracked death’s-head hawkmoths like this one by gluing radio transmitters to the insects’ backs.

<p>Once the researchers set the newly tagged and slightly annoyed moths free, Wikelski took off after them in a plane. As the insects flew south toward the Alps, a device onboard pinged the transmitters at a frequency related to the moths’ distance from the plane.</p>



<p>While detailed tracking of eight of the moths allowed him to follow the insects for about 63 kilometers on average, he pursued one for just under 90 kilometers. That’s the longest distance that an insect has been continuously tracked, he says. “It’s outrageously crazy work,” he says of the night flights at low altitude. “It’s also a little dangerous and it&#8217;s just showing it&#8217;s possible.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">NASA’s Artemis I mission sets the stage for our return to the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Artemis I blasts off into the sky over Florida, it may launch a new era of lunar science and exploration with it.</p>



<p>The NASA mission, now scheduled to launch in September after a scrubbed first attempt, is the first of three planned flights aimed at landing humans on the moon for the first time since 1972. No astronauts will fly on the upcoming mission. But the flight marks the first test of the technology — the rocket, the spacesuits, the watery return to Earth — that will ultimately take people, including the first woman and the first astronaut of color, to the lunar surface.</p>





<p>The test includes the first flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, and its Orion spacecraft, a rocket and crew capsule that have been decades in the making. These craft have been delayed, blown through their budgets and been threatened with cancellation more than once. Even within the spaceflight community, a lot of people feared they would never fly.</p>



<p>To see a human-capable moon rocket finally on the launchpad is “pretty astonishing,” says Casey Dreier, a Seattle-based space policy expert at the Planetary Society. “This is a reality that most of us alive on Earth today have never experienced.”</p>



<p>And if the Artemis program works, opportunities for science will follow.</p>



<p>“Because humans have to come back, alive, you have a huge opportunity to bring samples back with you,” Dreier says. Sending human astronauts may be a wedge to open the door for pure learning.</p>



<h4>The launch</h4>



<p>Artemis I was slated to lift off on August 29 at 8:33 a.m. EDT, but trouble with one if its engines led NASA to cancel that attempt. The next opportunity to launch is September 2 at 12:48 p.m. </p>



<p>When it does blast off, the SLS rocket will lift Orion into space, where the crew capsule will separate from the rocket and continue to an orbit around the moon. After circling the moon for about two weeks, Orion will slingshot back to Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego. The whole mission will last about 42 days.</p>



<p>Orion will stay in space longer than any other human-rated spacecraft has without docking to another spaceship, like the International Space Station. At its closest approach, the spacecraft will fly about 100 kilometers above the lunar surface. It will also go up to 64,000 kilometers past the moon, farther from Earth than any spacecraft built for humans. The previous record, set by Apollo 13 in 1970, was 16,000 kilometers beyond the far side of the moon.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Lunar liaison</h3>



<p>The Orion spacecraft’s outbound trajectory (green) will take it about 100 kilometers from the moon’s surface (<strong>1</strong>) before looping around and going into lunar orbit (<strong>2</strong>). After about two weeks circling the moon (gray), the capsule will leave lunar orbit (<strong>3</strong>) and start its return trip to Earth (blue). On its way back, the spacecraft will fire its engine, buzz the moon one more time (<strong>4</strong>) and then coast back to Earth for a watery landing.</p>

<p>The main goal of the mission is to prove that everything works. That includes Orion’s heat shield, which will need to protect astronauts as the capsule comes screaming through Earth’s atmosphere at 40,000 kilometers per hour and heats up to more than 2700° Celsius on its return trip. It also includes the procedure for retrieving the capsule and its crew and cargo after splashdown.</p>



<p>Even though it has no astronauts, the mission won’t be flying empty. Just beneath the Orion capsule are 10 CubeSats, small, simple spacecraft each about the size of a shoebox. After Orion separates from the SLS rocket, those CubeSats will go their separate ways to study the moon, the radiation environment in space and the effects of that radiation on organisms like yeast. One CubeSat will unfurl a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-sunshine">solar sail</a> and take off to explore a near-Earth asteroid (<em>SN: 8/26/11</em>).</p>



<h4>The “crew”</h4>



<p>Inside the Orion capsule ride three humanoid passengers. In the commander’s seat is faux astronaut Moonikin Campos, named for Arturo Campos, a NASA engineer who played a key role in returning the Apollo 13 moon mission safely to Earth after its in-flight disaster in 1970. The “moonikin” — a mashup of <em>moon</em> and <em>manikin </em>— is based on a firefighter training rescue manikin, says NASA engineer Dustin Gohmert. &nbsp;Moonikin Campos will be wearing the new flight suit that was designed for the Artemis missions.</p>

<p>The spacesuit is like a personalized spacecraft, says Gohmert, of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. It’s meant to be worn during takeoff, landing and any time there is an emergency in the cabin. The suit may look familiar to anyone who watched space shuttle launches, Gohmert says, because it does a very similar job: “It’s an orange suit that acts like a balloon that’s shaped like your body.”</p>



<p>The main difference is that the Orion suit, plus the accompanying helmet, seat and connection to the Orion spacecraft itself, are designed to keep a crew member alive for up to six days, the time it could take to get back to Earth if something goes wrong in deep space. Astronauts visiting the International Space Station, by contrast, were never more than a few hours from Earth.</p>



<p>To help make that week tolerable, each suit will be custom fit to the astronaut. “I’d like to say the word ‘comfort,’ but that’s a difficult word to use,” Gohmert says. “Nothing will be comfortable about six days in a spacesuit, no matter what you do.”</p>



<p>The suit and spacecraft will provide the astronauts with oxygen and scrub the astronauts’ air of carbon dioxide. The suit will also have a tube for the astronauts to eat liquid food and a way for them to collect urine and feces, although Moonikin Campos won’t test those aspects. He will be equipped with radiation sensors, while his seat will have sensors to detect acceleration and vibration throughout the mission.</p>

<p>The suit, helmet and seat all take safety lessons from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/after-tragedy">space shuttle Columbia disaster</a>, Gohmert says (<em>SN: 9/22/2003</em>). A junior engineer at the time, Gohmert worked on the suits the Columbia astronauts wore and saw the seven-member crew off to the launchpad. “It was a pivotal point for all of us, of course, who were there at the time,” he says. “If we didn’t take lessons from that, we wouldn’t be doing them justice.”</p>



<p>Moonikin Campos will be accompanied by a pair of mockup female torsos named Helga and Zohar. Their mission is to report back on space risks that are unique to female bodies, which have never been near the moon. NASA plans to send a woman on the first crewed Artemis flight, and women have different cancer risks from space radiation than men.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4.jpg" alt="Two mannequins of human torsos with heads, strapped into metal apparatuses" class="wp-image-3116590" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline4-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116590">Two female torsos named Helga and Zohar (shown) will fly on Artemis I to measure radiation risks for female astronauts.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116590">DLR (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The two torsos are figures used in medicine called anthropomorphic phantoms, which are made from materials that simulate human bone, tissue and organs. “They are in principle identical twins,” said physicist Thomas Berger of the German Aerospace Center in Cologne in a briefing on August 17. But Zohar — whose name means “light” or “radiance” in Hebrew — will wear a radiation protection vest provided by the Israel Space Agency and the private company StemRad, based in Tampa, Fla.</p>



<p>The vest is made of a polymer designed to deflect protons that the sun releases during solar storms and has more shielding over radiation-sensitive organs like breasts and ovaries. Each phantom will also carry more than 6,000 small radiation detectors to build a 3-D picture of the dose of charged particles a female astronaut might receive on a trip to the moon and back. Comparing the radiation levels each phantom receives will help refine the vest’s design for future astronauts.</p>



<p>Orion will also carry two other nonhuman passengers — the British stop motion television character&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ESA_names_first_astronaut_to_fly_on_the_Artemis_I_lunar_mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaun the sheep</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/snoopy-to-fly-on-nasas-artemis-i-moon-mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoopy</a>, who will serve as an indicator of zero gravity.</p>



<h4>The past and the future</h4>



<p>SLS and Orion have had a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01253-6">checkered history</a>. The program goes back to 2004, when President George W. Bush proposed sending astronauts to the moon and then to Mars. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled that plan, and then in 2017 President Donald Trump directed NASA to retrain its sights on the moon.</p>



<p>All the while, Congress continued to fund the development of the SLS rocket. Originally, SLS was supposed to cost $6 billion and fly in 2016. It has so far cost $23 billion on the eve of its launch in 2022.</p>



<p>“The rhetoric has flip-flopped a bunch,” Dreier says, as political leaders kept changing their vision for NASA’s direction. “But if you look at the actual programs, very little changed. … The whole time, the money was going to a moon rocket and a moon capsule.”</p>



<p>The next Artemis mission, Artemis II, is scheduled to launch in 2024 and take astronauts — real, live, human astronauts — around the moon but not to its surface.</p>



<p>Artemis III will be the moon landing mission. On August 19, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-identifies-candidate-regions-for-landing-next-americans-on-moon/">NASA announced 13 candidate landing regions</a>, all near the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-about-visit-uncharted-territory-moon">moon’s south pole</a>, an intriguing spot that has never been visited by humans (<em>SN: 11/11/18</em>). That mission is scheduled to launch in 2025, but there are still a lot of untested elements. Those include the actual lander, which will be built by SpaceX.</p>



<p>There are still a lot of things that can go wrong and a long way to go. But the Artemis I launch is an optimistic dawn for lunar science nevertheless. “The whole [human spaceflight] system has all been shifting to point at the moon,” Dreier says. “I think that’s profoundly exciting. There’s going to be really interesting lessons that happen no matter what comes out of this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">‘Chameleon’ forces remain elusive in a new dark energy experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>A chameleon-like force that shifts its nature based on its environment could explain a major physics quandary: how the mysterious substance called dark energy is compelling the cosmos to expand faster and faster. But a new experiment <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01706-9">casts doubt</a> on some chameleon theories, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature Physics</em>.</p>



<p>The chameleon force would be a fifth type of force beyond the basic four: gravitational, strong, weak and electromagnetic. And like a chameleon changing its colors, the hypothetical fifth force would morph depending on the density of its surroundings. In dense environments like Earth, this fifth force would be feeble, camouflaging its effects. In the sparseness of space, the force would be stronger and long-ranged.</p>





<p>This force would result from a chameleon field — an addition to the known fields in physics, such as electric, magnetic and gravitational fields. A chameleon field with these morphing properties could drive the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">accelerating expansion of the universe</a> without disagreeing with measurements on Earth.</p>



<p>But it’s a challenge to suss out such a changeling force. On Earth, says astrophysicist Jianhua He of Nanjing University in China, “it’s very, very tiny. That’s the most difficult part.”</p>



<p>So He and colleagues designed a detector to search for a subtle fifth force. A wheel with plastic films attached spins past another film sitting on a magnetically levitated piece of graphite. If a chameleon force really exists, the films spinning by would cause a periodic force on the levitating plastic, pulling it up and down. (Gravity also acts this way, but thanks to the device’s design, it should be much weaker than a chameleon force.)</p>



<p>The team was able to rule out a category of chameleon theories. In the future, the researchers hope to improve their results by chilling their device to allow for more sensitive measurements.</p>

<p>Doing this work takes a great team and my role is to both support the leaders in my group and to raise questions and suggestions so that we work towards the best outcomes. It&rsquo;s important to me that we understand the challenges that face our communities and listen so that we can work with them to develop solutions.</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiatives have you been involved with to help lead others in the way research is communicated?</strong></p>



<p>Quite a few! I can think of a few highlights. I&rsquo;ve worked alongside <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-changing-the-landscape-to-make-open-access-more-affordable/">Sara </a>and colleagues across PLOS to develop our new business models, which provide alternatives to APCs,removing barriers to inclusion in sharing research while addressing cost inflation for research-intensive institutions which is vital to allow a greater diversity of voices and research findings to be represented. Another highlight for me was the development and launch of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new publishing venues</a> to enable co-creation of Open Science communities of practice in fields that are vital to addressing the challenges society faces globally,&nbsp; including climate, public health and sustainability. And I work with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-collaborating-globally-to-build-trust-in-science/">Roheena</a> and the regional publishing directors to developour networks in different regions so that we can better understand the cultural, political and economic contexts in which our communities are working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My contribution is only one small part of each of these exciting initiatives and it&rsquo;s great to have the opportunity to be involved in so many projects that are not only reshaping PLOS, but have the potential to deepen our understanding of researchers&rsquo; needs globally and drive necessary change in science communicationt</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has from the outset been focused on catalyzing broad-scale systemic change. In order to achieve this we need to directly address the perception of objectivity and empirical research, through focusing on driving Open Science and addressing the cultural and economic contexts that influence research and research-sharing in science and medicine.&nbsp; Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.&nbsp; Without equitable participation in knowledge-sharing,&nbsp; hearing the voices that have been missing, and a willingness to experiment and explore, we will fall short of the goal of Open Science to increase the benefits of research for society globally.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>I believe that a great team, or group, can achieve more than any one individual which is very much in line with the values of Open Science. In an Open Science ecosystem, each individual contribution builds on and contributes to the whole body of knowledge which is bigger than any one person. And making a real difference in addressing the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions is extremely important. &nbsp;I also love science and I&rsquo;m fascinated by the influences of culture and context on scientific research and I feel very lucky to be able to work at something that interests me and where I have lots of opportunities to learn.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p>I haven&rsquo;t given too much thought to what people will think, but I hope that my contributions will have made a difference. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with some amazing people &ndash; both scientists and publishing professionals &ndash; from whom I have learned a lot and with whom I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun too! I&nbsp; have former team members who have gone on to develop their careers in ways that they have found rewarding and where they&rsquo;ve also been able to influence and drive change and I have valued the opportunity to work with them. And I hope I will have contributed in some way to address injustice and imbalance in the system &ndash; and maybe even been part of making it possible for us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by a system based on Open Science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mealworms-sugar-new-seasoning-smell-meat">A new seasoning smells like meat thanks to sugar — and mealworms</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spoonful of sugar may help the mealworms go down.</p>



<p>Adding sugars to powdered, cooked mealworms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_d5BghR88&amp;list=PL-qHxGvFeZV11YAygI6lgZ6yOq2nWwvv7&amp;index=5">creates a seasoning</a> with an appetizing “meatlike” odor, researchers report August 24 at the American Chemical Society fall meeting in Chicago.</p>



<p>Some insects have been found to be an environmentally friendly alternative to other animal protein <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">because they require less land and water to raise</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/19</em>). But many people in the United States and other Western countries, where insects aren’t eaten widely, generally find the idea of chomping down on bugs unappetizing.</p>





<p>“There aren&#8217;t a lot of people ready to fry up a whole skillet of crickets and eat them fresh,” says Julie Lesnik, a biological anthropologist at Wayne State University in Detroit who wasn’t involved in the new research. Finding out how to make insect-based foods more appealing could be key to making them more mainstream.</p>



<p>And one successful insect-based product could have a snowball effect for similar food. “It&#8217;s really great that this research is happening, because at any point this might be the thing that people figure out and then it explodes,” says Brenden Campbell, an insect agriculturist based in Eugene, Ore. He has studied mealworms and created a company called Planet Bugs to, in part, make insect-based food products.</p>



<p>In a previous study, chemist In Hee Cho of Wonkwang University in South Korea and colleagues analyzed the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372989/">odors given off by mealworms that were steamed, roasted or deep-fried</a>. Steamed mealworms produced a sweet smell, like corn, while roasted and fried mealworms released chemicals more similar to meat and seafood.</p>



<p>In their latest work, the team then keyed in on what combinations of water, sugars and cooking time produced a particularly meaty smell, and tested these concoctions with volunteers to figure out which smelled the most appealing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insects ground up or in seasonings, like Cho’s team did, could help people get past their hesitations about eating whole bugs, says Amy Wright, who has written a book on eating bugs. (She, for one, has no qualms. A literature professor at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tenn., Wright used to keep mealworms in her apartment, which she would use in sandwiches and guacamole.)</p>



<p>“There are plenty of things that are disgusting to us, but we have engineered around it,” Lesnik says. “We&#8217;re just seeing insects being treated like any other food, and yeah, we&#8217;re talking aroma … but that&#8217;s what the engineers of Doritos are doing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">7-million-year-old limb fossils may be from the earliest known hominid</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2001, researchers unearthed a partial fossil leg bone and two forearm bones in the central African nation of Chad. Those fossils come from the earliest known hominid, which lived around 7 million years ago, and reveal that the creature walked upright both on the ground and in the trees, a new study proposes.</p>



<p>But a lively debate surrounds the fossils, concerning whether they actually belong to the hominid species, known as <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, or to an ancient ape, and to what extent either species could have adopted a two-legged gait. These have become vexing questions as scientists increasingly suspect that ape and hominid species evolved a variety of ways to walk upright, some more efficient than others, around 7 million years ago.</p>





<p>Since its discovery, the leg bone has also triggered competing accusations of scientific misconduct and an official investigation by the French government–funded research organization CNRS in Paris.</p>



<p>Previously, skull, jaw and tooth finds uncovered at the Chad site in 2001 and 2004 were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/untangling-ancient-roots-earliest-hominid-shows-new-improved-face">classified as remnants of <em>S. tchadensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/6/05</em>). The finds are the only other fossils attributed to the species, though some researchers have also since suggested that those fossils represent an ancient ape instead.</p>



<p>Analyses of the three limb bones show that they belong to the previously identified <em>Sahelanthropus</em> species, say paleontologists Guillaume Daver and Franck Guy, both of the University of Poitiers in France, and their colleagues. And internal and external features of the leg bone indicate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04901-z">that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> walked upright</a>, the scientists report August 24 in <em>Nature</em>. Shapes and structures of the two forearm bones suggest that the hominid moved on two legs through trees while grasping branches with its hands, the team says.</p>



<p>“The Chadian species has a set of anatomical features that clearly indicate that our oldest known [hominid] representative [walked] on the ground and in the trees,” Guy says. It’s hard to tell how efficiently or how fast <em>Sahelanthropus</em> moved on two legs, he adds.</p>



<p>Guy’s team studied 3-D digital models of the fossils derived from CT scans. The leg bone was compared with fossils of ancient apes and other hominids and with modern apes and humans. Traits including thickening of the leg bone’s tough outer layer at key points and the presence of an internal bony projection near the hip joint signal an upright stance, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Fossils from the African site, including the three limb bones, suggest that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> was the earliest known hominid, agrees paleoanthropologist Kristian Carlson of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who did not participate in the new study. But exactly how it moved while upright remains unknown, he says. <em>Sahelanthropus</em> exhibits a mix of upper leg and forearm traits that differs from those of living apes and humans, suggesting it adopted a novel posture and limb movements while walking.</p>



<p>Whatever stance <em>Sahelanthropus</em> assumed, it probably resembled that of two other early hominids, roughly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestor-gets-leg-walking">6-million-year-old <em>Orrorin tugenensis</em></a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-ancestors-come-together-humanitys-roots-may-lie-single-diverse-genus">more than 5-million-year-old <em>Ardipithecus kadabba</em></a>, says paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University in Tempe (<em>SN: 9/11/04; SN: 3/3/04</em>). Walking abilities of those hominids remain poorly understood due to limited fossils — a partial leg bone for <em>O. tugenensis</em> and a toe bone for the <em>Ardipithecus</em> species.</p>



<p>Haile-Selassie regards all three hominids as part of a single genus that evolved from around 7 million to 5 million years ago. On that issue, “the debate is open, even between members of our team,” Guy says.</p>



<p>Another debate concerns the upper leg’s internal bony projection that the researchers cite as crucial for standing upright. That trait sometimes appears in modern African apes and occasionally is absent in humans, paleoanthropologist Marine Cazenave of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and colleagues report in the June <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>. The presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2022.103183">this bony growth does not definitively show that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> walked upright</a>, Cazenave says.</p>



<p>Other researchers contend that the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248420301597">leg bone most likely comes from an ancient ape</a> — not a hominid — that may have occasionally walked upright. Shape measurements, including curvature of the fossil’s shaft, closely resemble those of modern chimps’ upper leg bones, University of Poitiers paleoanthropologist Roberto Macchiarelli and colleagues reported in December 2020 in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>“There may have been ancient apes that had distinctive types of [upright movement] unlike any living apes, including humans,” says paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who was a coauthor of the 2020 study.</p>



<p>Here is where charges of scientific misconduct come into play. The 2020 study was based on measurements of the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> leg fossil taken in 2004 by a University of Poitiers graduate student conducting a project on how fossilization affects bones.</p>



<p>That student, Aude Bergeret-Medina, was given access to fossils from the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> site that Daver and Guy’s team had tagged as neither hominid nor, more generally, as primate. She noted that one specimen — the leg bone — looked like it belonged to a primate, possibly an ape. Macchiarelli confirmed her observation. Plans for Bergeret-Medina to cut open the bone to study its mineral content were halted.</p>



<p>Macchiarelli informed his university and CNRS of the fossil’s identity. He spent the next 16 years, he says, sending repeated complaints to those institutions that the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> discoverers were violating codes of scientific conduct by not providing information about the leg bone in scientific papers or talks.</p>



<p>Then, CNRS launched an investigation of possible misconduct by Macchiarelli himself when the 2020 study appeared before the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> team published findings on the leg bone in its possession. No ruling has been made yet.</p>



<p>In supplementary information published with the new study, Guy and colleagues write that they identified the forearm bones among stored fossils after Macchiarelli brought the leg bone’s identity to their attention. Further excavations in Chad were conducted before launching a detailed study of the three limb fossils in 2017, the team says.</p>



<p>But the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> team does not cite Bergeret-Medina — now the curator of the Muséum d&#8217;Histoire Naturelle Jacques de La Comble in Autun, France — by name for her role in the leg bone’s identification. The investigators write that “a master’s student in taphonomy” received various fossils for a research internship in early 2004 before those finds had been carefully examined by senior scientists. The student, “seeking expertise,” gave the leg fossil to Macchiarelli who identified it as a hominid, Daver and colleagues say.</p>



<p>That’s incorrect, Macchiarelli contends. Bergeret-Medina initially identified the fossil as a primate’s upper leg bone followed by his confirmation of her observation. No claim was made that the fossil came from a hominid, he says. But without Bergeret-Medina’s insightful fossil observation, the new study would never have happened, Macchiarelli asserts. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Visualizing Genes: The Possible Dream</strong> <br>–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/visualizing-genes-possible-dream"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 2, 1972</p>



<p>Molecular biologists can now visualize the larger structures of the cell, such as the nucleus and chromosomes, under the powerful electron microscope. But they have not been able to obtain images of genes (DNA) on the chromosomes. Nor have they been able to see RNA … or the intricate details of cell membranes, enzymes and viruses.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Electron m­icroscopes have become much more powerful over the last 50 years. For instance, in 1981, biophysicist Jacques D­ubochet discovered that tiny biological structures super­cooled with ethane could be observed in their natural state under an electron microscope. That finding paved the way for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-goes-3-d-snapshots-lifes-atomic-details">cryo-electron micro­scopy</a>, which scientists use to visualize proteins, viruses and bacteria at the molecular level (<em>SN: 10/28/17, p. 6</em>). Capturing detailed images of genes remains elusive, but scientists are inching closer. In 2021, researchers reported using an electron microscope and the molecular scissors CRISPR/Cas9 to visualize proteins <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01752-8">transcribing DNA instructions</a> for two genes into RNA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-deprivation-people-selfish-less-generous-brain-activity">Sleep deprivation may make people less generous</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lack of sleep has been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/restless-sleep-associated-heart-rhythm-problems">heart disease</a>, poor mood and loneliness (<em>SN: 11/15/16</em>). Being tired could also <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001733">make us less generous</a>, researchers report August 23 in <em>PLOS Biology.</em></p>



<p>The hour of sleep lost in the switch over to Daylight Savings Time every spring appears to reduce people’s tendency to help others, the researchers found in one of three experiments testing the link between sleep loss and generosity. Specifically, they showed that average donations to one U.S.-based nonprofit organization dropped by around 10 percent in the workweek after the time switch compared with four weeks before and after the change. In Arizona and Hawaii, states that do not observe Daylight Savings Time, donations remained unchanged. &nbsp;</p>





<p>With over half of the people living in parts of the developed world reporting that they rarely get enough sleep during the workweek, the finding has implications beyond the week we spring forward, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“Lack of sleep shapes the social experiences we have [and] the kinds of societies we live in,” says neuroscientist Eti Ben Simon of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>To test the link between sleep loss and generosity, Ben Simon and her team first brought 23 young adults into the lab for two nights. The participants slept through one night and stayed awake for another night.</p>



<p>In the mornings, participants completed a standardized altruism questionnaire rating their likelihood of helping strangers or acquaintances in various scenarios. For instance, participants rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 for least likely to help and 5 for most likely, whether they would give up their seat on a bus to a stranger or offer a ride to a coworker in need. Participants never read the same scenario more than once. Roughly 80 percent of participants showed less likelihood of helping others when sleep-deprived than when rested.</p>



<p>The researchers then observed participants’ brain activity in a functional MRI machine, comparing each participant’s neural activity in a rested versus sleep-deprived state. That showed that sleep deprivation reduced activity in a network of brain regions linked to the ability to empathize with others.</p>



<p>In another experiment, the researchers recruited 136 participants online and had them keep a sleep log for four nights. Each participant then completed subsets of the altruism questionnaire before 1 p.m. the next day. The researchers found that the more time participants spent awake in bed, a measure of poor sleep, the lower their altruism scores. That drop in altruism held true both when comparing individuals to themselves and when averaging scores across the group.</p>



<p>In the final experiment focused on Daylight Savings Time, the researchers looked at charitable donations from 2001 to 2016 to Donors Choose, a nonprofit that raises money for school projects across the United States. When the team excluded Hawaii and Arizona, as well as outliers like very large donations, more than 3.4 million donations remained. In the workweek following the time change, total donations, which typically averaged roughly $82 per day, dropped to about $73 per day, Ben Simon says.</p>



<p>There’s always a possibility that some other variable besides sleep is causing this dip in generosity, says behavioral economist David Dickinson of Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C. But this “triple methodology approach” enabled the researchers to draw a convincing line from changes to the brain that appear during sleep deprivation to real-world behavior. “This puts a more comprehensive story on how inefficient sleep affects decisions in this domain of helping others,” he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-recovery-weekend-health">Chronic sleep deprivation</a> in the modern world is a serious problem, Ben Simon says (<em>SN: 3/1/19</em>). But unlike many other large-scale problems — think climate change or political polarization — this one has a ready solution. “If you think about promoting sleep and letting people get the sleep they need, what an impact that could have on the societies we live in.”</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us a little bit about what you do at PLOS</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I&rsquo;m in the process of recruiting regional team members and partners on the ground who will engage and work with communities and stakeholders to develop a fair and equitable open research future.</span></p>
<p>To achieve increased representation and inclusion, and a fair and equitable open research future, we need to understand the contexts (cultural, political, economic) in which research stakeholders and communities function.&#8203; We need to understand the barriers and challenges in their local open research communication ecosystems, and to co-develop solutions with them to solve these problems so that &ldquo;open&rdquo; can work for them in the contexts in which they work.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>Therefore, we also need to be <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-exploring-the-possibilities-of-open-science-2/">curious </a>and explore new possibilities. We need to listen to and learn from communities and stakeholders, rather than go with preconceptions or assumptions about how things might work or should work in different countries and regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with to ensure trust in research?</strong></p>



<p>Via the Regional Directors and partners, we are forming networks and building relationships with the range of stakeholders who support research and researchers in those local ecosystems. We&rsquo;re working with funders, policy makers, governments and institutional leaders, and we&rsquo;re advocating for Open Science at a local level. Through these relationships, we&rsquo;re helping to increase awareness and education around the benefits of Open Science, engage in Open Science policy, and build knowledge of issues and challenges that local communities face in Open Science adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always emphasize that Open Science relates not just to openness, but to rigor, reliability, robustness, and quality of research, and therefore its trustworthiness. By making the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication more transparent and making more artifacts of research and peer review public, Open Science invites discussion and feedback from a more diverse community earlier in the process. This contributes to high-quality, reproducible and reliable research, demonstrating the trust and integrity of the research, and of the researchers themselves</p>



<p>Key initiatives include our collaborations in Africa, including the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">African Association of Universities</a>, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">East African Commission for Science &amp; Technology</a> with our partners <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>, both looking to increase education and awareness around the benefits of Open Science with institutional leadership and national research councils and higher education commissions respectively. And we&rsquo;re delighted that global partners such as UNESCO have supported these initiatives as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for research?</strong></p>



<p>Science and research are and need to be global and collaborative endeavours if we are to solve the greatest challenges Society and humanity faces. Therefore we need to ensure that all who need to participate, can do so, and that no voices are excluded from the debate and conversation.</p>



<p>Our work with local communities and stakeholders aims to ensure that everyone can participate both in this scientific conversation and in an open future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Science, when done well, should enable and facilitate global collaboration, and participation. By making opportunities to publish, peer review, and read accessible to everyone, Open Science at once enriches the scholarly literature, attracts more readers to published research, and maximizes the impact of that research. It democratises access and utility of knowledge, and allows more scholars to build upon the work to positively impact our future.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>Everything we do at PLOS aims to advance the adoption of Open Science for all the benefits it brings. Personally, it&rsquo;s important for me to work in an organisation whose values sync with my own and I am passionate about our mission to transform scholarly communication. Specifically, my role contributes to our goal to increase equitable participation in Open Science, which is fundamental to having a truly global and collaborative discussion about the challenges humanity and our planet faces. It&rsquo;s a privilege to be part of this, even in such a tiny way. If we can bring more people into this conversation, if we can enable them to participate where they would not have been able to before, then that would be wonderful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution</strong></p>



<p>For me, it is less about my personal contribution, but more about the overall impact and achievement. I would love to see PLOS become the truly global publisher it is on the way to being, with true representation from across the globe embedded in shaping the unique contributions that PLOS makes towards that fully open, equitable future.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/08/23/self-supervised-denoising-of-calcium-imaging-data/">Self-supervised denoising of calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                <p>This blog post is about algorithms based on deep networks to denoise raw calcium imaging movies. More specifically, I will write about the difficulties to interprete their outputs, and on how to address these limitations in future work. I will also share my own experience with denoising calcium imaging data from astrocytes in mice.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Averages from calcium imaging or representative movies in publications often look great. In reality, however,  two-photon calcium imaging is often limited primarily by low signal-to-noise ratios. There are many cases where recordings are dominated by shot noise to the extent that almost no structure is visible from a single frame. This can be due to a weakly expressing transgenic line; or on-purpose low expression levels to avoid calcium buffering; or it can be due to the fact that the microscope scans so fast across a large field of view or volume that it only picks up a few photons per neuron.</p>



<p><strong>The advent of new algorithms to denoise calcium imaging movies</strong></p>



<p>So, would it not be great to get rid of the noise in these noise-dominated movies using some magical deep learning algorithm? This seems to be the promise of a whole set of algorithms that were designed to denoise noisy images and recover the true signal using either supervised [1] but recently also self-supervised deep learning [2-3]. Recently, there have also been a few applications of these algorithms for calcium imaging [4-6]. The following tweet by Jérôme Lecoq was the first time I saw the results of such algorithms:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Colleagues at <a href="https://twitter.com/AllenInstitute?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AllenInstitute</a>, friends and my fellow neuroscientists, I just pushed a new paper which I believe is important to the field. We found a way to remove independent noise in systems neuroscience! <a href="https://t.co/gAxWJdc1OI">https://t.co/gAxWJdc1OI</a></p>&mdash; Jérôme Lecoq (@LecoqJerome) <a href="https://twitter.com/LecoqJerome/status/1317157955523862529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The results look indeed very impressive. The implementations of these algorithms were subsequently published, by Lecoq et al. (DeepInterpolation) [4] and independently with a very similar approach by Li et al. (DeepCAD) [5]. Since then, a few follow-ups were published to compare performance among the two algorithms and also to improve performance of DeepCAD [6], or with ideas to apply supervised algorithms to denoise calcium imaging data [7].</p>



<p>Despite the great-looking results, I was a bit skeptical. Not because of a pratical but rather because of a theoretical concern: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">there is no free lunch</a>. Why should the output suddenly be less noisy than the input? How can the apparent information content increase? Let&#8217;s have a closer look at how the algorithm works to address this question.</p>



<p><strong>Taking into account additional information to improve pixel value estimates</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start very simple: Everybody will agree that the <em>measured </em>intensity for a pixel is a good estimate for the <em>true </em>fluorescence or calcium concentration at this location. However, we can refine our estimate very easily using some background information. What kind of background information? For example, if a high intensity value occurs in a region without any labeling, with all other time points of this pixel having almost zero value, we can be rather certain that this outlier is due to a falsely detected photon and not due to a true fluorescence signal. If however all surrounding pixels had high intensity values and the pixel of interest not, we could also correct our estimate of this pixel&#8217;s intensity value using (1) our experience about the spatial structures that we want to observe and (2) the information gained from the surround pixels. Therefore, refining our estimate of the pixel&#8217;s intensity is simply taking into account a prior what we expect the pixel&#8217;s intensity to be.</p>



<p>Methods based on self-supervised deep networks perform more or less such a procedure, and it is in my opinion a very reasonable way to obtain a better estimate for a pixel&#8217;s intensity. As a small difference, they only use the surrounding frames (adjacent in time) and not the pixel intensity itself (therefore lacking this Bayesian idea of improving an estimate using prior information). Despite this interesting small difference, it is clear that such denoising will &#8211; in principle &#8211; work. The network then uses deep learning to gain knowledge about what to expect in a given context; practically speaking, the prior knowledge will be contained in the network&#8217;s weights and extracted from a lot of raw data during learning. Using such a procedure, the estimate of the pixel&#8217;s intensity value will, probably under most conditions, be better than the raw intensity value.</p>



<p><strong>A side note:</strong> <strong>Computing the SNR from raw and denoised pixels</strong></p>



<p>From that, it is also clear that neighboring pixels of a denoised movie are correlated since their original values have influenced each other. It is therefore not justified to compare something like a SNR based on single pixels or single frames between raw and denoised data, because in one case (raw data) adjacent data points are truly independent measurements, while in the other (denoised data) they are not. Both DeepInterpolation [4] and DeepCAD [5] used such SNR measures that reflect the visual look and feel but are, in my opinion, not a good quantification of how much signal and how much noise is in the data. But this just as a side note.</p>



<p><strong>Denoising can make plausible point estimates that are however artifacts</strong></p>



<p>However, there is a remaining real problem. Let&#8217;s take some time to understand it. Clearly, the estimated intensity value is only a point estimate. So we don&#8217;t know anything about the confidence of the network to infer exactly this pixel intensity and not a different intensity value. Deep networks have been often shown to hallucinate familiar patterns when they were unconstrained by input. It is therefore not clear from looking at the results whether the network was very confident about all pixel intensities or whether it just made up something plausible because the input did not constrain the output sufficiently.</p>



<p>To make this rather vague concern a bit more concerete, here is an example of a calcium recording that I performed a few years ago (adult zebrafish forebrain, GCaMP6f). On the left side, you can see the full FOV, on the right side a zoom-in.<br />In the movie, there is first a version based on raw data, then the same raw data but with a smoothing temporal average, and finally a version denoised using the DeepInterpolation algorithm [4]. To provide optimal conditions, I did not use a default network provided by the authors but retrained it on the same data to which I applied the algorithm afterwards.</p>

<p>First, the apparent denoising is impressive, and it is easy to imagine that an algorithm performing automated source extraction will perform better for the denoised movie as for the raw movie.<br />When we look more carefully and with more patience, a few odd things pop out. In particular, the neuronal structures seem to &#8220;wobble around&#8221; a bit. Here is a short extract of a zoom-in into the denoised movie:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="7157" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/08/23/self-supervised-denoising-of-calcium-imaging-data/zoom_in/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif" data-orig-size="60,53" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom_in" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" alt="" class="wp-image-7157" width="413" height="365" /></figure></div>


<p>Neurons are densely packed in this region, such that the cytoplasms filled by GCaMP generate an almost hexagonal pattern when you slice through it with the imaging plane. In the excerpt above, there is indeed a sort of hexagonal pattern in each frame. However, the cell boundaries are shifting around from frame to frame. This shifting of boundaries can be particularly well seen for the cell boundary between the right-most neuron and its neighbor to the left. From the perspective of an intelligent human observer, these shifting boundaries are obviously wrong &#8211; it is clear that the brain and its neurons do not move.</p>



<p>So, what happened? The network indeed inferred some structural pattern from the noise, but it arrived at different conclusions for different time points. The network made the most likely guess for each timepoint given the (little) information it was provided, but the inconsistency of the morphological pattern shows that the network made up something plausible that however is partially wrong.</p>



<p><strong>Solution (1): Taking into account the overall time-averaged fluorescence </strong></p>



<p>To fix this problem specifically, the network could take into account not only surrounding pixels, but also the overall mean fluorescence (average across all movie frames) in order to make an educated guess about pixel intensity. As human observers, we do this automatically, and that&#8217;s why we can spot the artifact to start with. With the information about the overall anatomy, the network would have the same prior as the human observer and would be able to produce outputs that do not include such artifacts.</p>



<p><strong>Solution (2): Taking into account the uncertainty of point estimates</strong></p>



<p>However, the more general problem of the network to fill up uncertain situations with seemingly plausible but sometimes very wrong point estimates still persists. The only difference is that a human observer probably would be unable to identify the generated artifacts.</p>



<p>A real solution to the problem is to properly deal with uncertainties (for reference, here a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03342">review of uncertainty in deep networks</a>). This means that the network needs to be able to estimate not only the most likely intensity values for each pixel but also the confidence intervals for each value. With a confidence interval for each pixel value, one could compute the confidence interval for e.g. the time course of a neuron&#8217;s calcium ΔF/F averaged across an ROI. The computational problem here is that the error ranges for each pixel do not just add as independent errors, resulting in a standard error of the mean, since the values and confidence intervals for adjacent pixels are dependent on each other. I assume that a straight-forward analytical treatment might be too tricky and some sort of Monte Carlo-based simulation would work better here. This would make it possible to use the denoised movie to derive e.g. a temporal ΔF/F trace of a neuron together with an uncertainty corridor of the estimated trace.</p>



<p>To sum it up, at this point it seems that there is not only a need to develop tools that provide faster and more beautiful denoised images, but even more so procedures to properly deal with uncertainties of estimates that reflect an output that is not enough constrained by the input. Without such tools, analyses based on denoised data must be carefully inspected whether they might be susceptible to such artifacts.</p>



<p><strong>Practical aspects: Using denoising for astrocytic calcium imaging</strong></p>



<p>In a recent preprint [8], I used such methods (DeepInterpolation [4]) to denoise calcium recordings from hippocampal astrocytes. Astrocytes are rather sensitive to laser-induced heating, and I therefore applied low excitation power, resulting in relatively noisy raw recordings. One main goal of the study was to study not only ROIs drawn around somata but also the spatio-temporal calcium dynamics from somatic and distal compartments, ideally with a precision of a single pixel.</p>



<p>To be able to quantify such patterns, it was essential to denoise the raw movie (see Figure 6e and supplemental Figure S8 in [8]). Briefly, it worked really nicely:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='640' height='231' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/8gvx5GYL?cover=1&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent="true"  allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1658470809'></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It was however crucial to carefully look at both raw and denoised data to understand what was going on, and to consider potential artifacts with respect to downstream analyses. In my case, it helped that the central result of the paper, that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v1.full#F6">calcium signals propagated from distal to proximal compartments under certain conditions</a>, was based on analyses averaged over time (due to the use of <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/01/09/the-power-of-correlation-functions/">correlation functions</a>). Such averaging is likely to undo any harm introduced by small artifacts generated by denoising. In addition, I carefully looked at raw together with denoised data and thought about possible artifacts that might be introduced by denoising.</p>



<p>The second aspect to notice is that the algorithm was rather difficult to use, required a GPU with large memory and still then was very slow. This has improved a bit since then, but the hardware requirements are still high. An alternative algorithm [5] seems to have slightly lower requirements on hardware, and the authors of [5] also developed a modified version of their algorithm that seems to be much faster, at least for inference [6].</p>



<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>



<p>The development of methods to denoise imaging data is a very interesting field, and I look forward to seeing more work in this direction. Specifically, I hope that the two possible developments mentioned above (taking into account the time-averaged fluorescence and dealing properly with uncertainty) will be properly explored by other groups.</p>



<p>Researchers who apply denoising techniques are themselves often very well aware of potential pitfalls and hallucinations generated by U-Nets or other related techniques. For example, Laine et al. [9] end their review of deep learning-based denoising techniques with this note of caution:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Therefore, we do not recommend, at this stage, performing intensity-based quantification on denoised images but rather to go back to the raw [images] as much as possible to avoid artefacts.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With &#8220;quantification&#8221;, they do not refer to the computation of ΔF/F but rather to studies that quantify e.g. localized protein expression in cells. But should the computation of ΔF/F values have less strict standards?</p>



<p>There are a few cases where potential problems and artifacts are immediately obvious for the application of denoising methods to calcium imaging data. Self-supervised denoising uses the raw data to learn the most likely intensity value given. As a consequence, there will be a tendency to suppress outliers. This is not bad by itself because such outliers are most likely just noise. But there might also be biologically relevant outliers: rare local calcium events on a small branch of a dendritic tree; or unusually shaped calcium events due to intracellularly recruited calcium; or unexpected decoupling of two adjacent neurons that are otherwise strongly coupled by electrical synapses. If the raw SNR is not high enough, the network will take such events as unlikely to be true and discard them in favor of something more normal.</p>



<p>As always, it is the experimenter who is responsible that such concerns are considered. To this end, some basic understanding of the available tools and their limitations is required. Hopefully this blog post helps to make a step into this direction!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">The discovery of the Kuiper Belt revamped our view of the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">On a Hawaiian mountaintop in the summer of 1992, a pair of scientists spotted a pinprick of light inching through the constellation Pisces. That unassuming object — located over a billion kilometers beyond Neptune — would rewrite our understanding of the solar system.</p>



<p>Rather than an expanse of emptiness, there was something, a vast collection of things in fact, lurking beyond the orbits of the known planets.</p>



<p>The scientists had discovered the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped swath of frozen objects left over from the formation of the solar system.</p>





<p>As researchers learn more about the Kuiper Belt, the origin and evolution of our solar system is coming into clearer focus. Closeup glimpses of the Kuiper Belt’s frozen worlds have shed light on how planets, including our own, might have formed in the first place. And surveys of this region, which have collectively revealed thousands of such bodies, called Kuiper Belt objects, suggest that the early solar system was home to pinballing planets.</p>



<p>The humble object that kick-started it all is a chunk of ice and rock roughly 250 kilometers in diameter. It was first spotted 30 years ago this month.</p>





<h4>Staring into space</h4>



<p>In the late 1980s, planetary scientist David Jewitt and astronomer Jane Luu, both at MIT at the time, were several years into a curious quest. The duo had been using telescopes in Arizona to take images of patches of the night sky with no particular target in mind. “We were literally just staring off into space looking for something,” says Jewitt, now at UCLA.</p>



<p>An apparent mystery motivated the researchers: The inner solar system is relatively crowded with rocky planets, asteroids and comets, but there was seemingly not much out beyond the gas giant planets, besides small, icy Pluto. “Maybe there were things in the outer solar system,” says Luu, who now works at the University of Oslo and Boston University. “It seemed like a worthwhile thing to check out.”</p>

Jewitt/UCLA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Poring over glass photographic plates and digital images of the night sky, Jewitt and Luu looked for objects that moved extremely slowly, a telltale sign of their great distance from Earth. But the pair kept coming up empty. “Years went by, and we didn’t see anything,” Luu says. “There was no guarantee this was going to work out.”</p>



<p>The tide changed in 1992. On the night of August 30, Jewitt and Luu were using a University of Hawaii telescope on the Big Island. They were employing their usual technique for searching for distant objects: Take an image of the night sky, wait an hour or so, take another image of the same patch of sky, and repeat. An object in the outer reaches of the solar system would shift position ever so slightly from one image to the next, primarily because of the movement of Earth in its orbit. “If it’s a real object, it would move systematically at some predicted rate,” Luu says.</p>



<p>By 9:14 p.m. that evening, Jewitt and Luu had collected two images of the same bit of the constellation Pisces. The researchers displayed the images on the bulbous cathode-ray tube monitor of their computer, one after the other, and looked for anything that had moved. One object immediately stood out: A speck of light had shifted just a touch to the west.</p>



<p>But it was too early to celebrate. Spurious signals from high-energy particles zipping through space — <a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/cosmic_rays1.html">cosmic rays</a> — appear in images of the night sky all of the time. The real test would be whether this speck showed up in more than two images, the researchers knew.</p>



<p>Jewitt and Luu nervously waited until 11 p.m. for the telescope’s camera to finish taking a third image. The same object was there, and it had moved a bit farther west. A fourth image, collected just after midnight, revealed the object had shifted position yet again. This is something real, Jewitt remembers thinking. “We were just blown away.”</p>

It was the first evidence of the icy zone called the Kuiper Belt.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116382">D. Jewitt/UCLA</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Based on the object’s brightness and its leisurely pace — it would take nearly a month for it to march across the width of the full moon as seen from Earth — Jewitt and Luu did some quick calculations. This thing, whatever it was, was probably about 250 kilometers in diameter. That’s sizable, about one-tenth the width of Pluto. It was orbiting far beyond Neptune. And in all likelihood, it wasn’t alone.</p>



<p>Although Jewitt and Luu had been diligently combing the night sky for years, they had observed only a tiny fraction of it. There were possibly thousands more objects out there like this one just waiting to be found, the two concluded.</p>



<p>The realization that the outer solar system was probably teeming with undiscovered bodies was mind-blowing, Jewitt says. “We expanded the known volume of the solar system enormously.” The object that Jewitt and Luu had found, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/distant-object-hints-kuiper-belt">1992 QB1</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/92, p. 196</em>), introduced a whole new realm.</p>



<p>Just a few months later, Jewitt and Luu <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/images-hint-comet-reservoir-breakup">spotted a second object</a> also orbiting far beyond Neptune (<em>SN: 4/10/93, p. 231</em>). The floodgates opened soon after. “We found 40 or 50 in the next few years,” Jewitt says. As the digital detectors that astronomers used to capture images grew in size and sensitivity, researchers began uncovering droves of additional objects. “So many interesting worlds with interesting stories,” says Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who studies Kuiper Belt objects.</p>



<p>Finding all of these frozen worlds, some orbiting even beyond Pluto, made sense in some ways, Jewitt and Luu realized. Pluto had always been an oddball; it’s a cosmic runt (smaller than Earth’s moon) and looks nothing like its gas giant neighbors. What’s more, its orbit takes it sweeping far above and below the orbits of the other planets. Maybe Pluto belonged not to the world of the planets but to the realm of whatever lay beyond, Jewitt and Luu hypothesized. “We suddenly understood why Pluto was such a weird planet,” Jewitt says. “It’s just one object, maybe the biggest, in a set of bodies that we just stumbled across.” Pluto probably wouldn’t be a member of the planet club much longer, the two predicted. Indeed, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">by 2006, it was out</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/06, p. 149</em>).</p>



<h4>Up-close look</h4>



<p>The discovery of 1992 QB1 opened the world’s eyes to the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/">Kuiper Belt</a>, named after <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/720/gerard-kuiper-1905-1973/">Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper</a>. In a twist of history, however, Kuiper predicted that this region of space would be empty. In the 1950s, he proposed that any occupants that might have once existed there would have been banished by gravity to even more distant reaches of the solar system.</p>



<p>In other words, Kuiper anti-predicted the existence of the Kuiper Belt. He turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p>Today, researchers know that the Kuiper Belt stretches from a distance of roughly 30 <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/measuring/">astronomical units</a> from the sun — around the orbit of Neptune — to roughly 55 astronomical units. It resembles a puffed-up disk, Jewitt says. “Superficially, it looks like a fat doughnut.”</p>



<p>The frozen bodies that populate the Kuiper Belt are the remnants of the swirling maelstrom of gas and dust that birthed the sun and the planets. There’s “a bunch of stuff that’s left over that didn’t quite get built up into planets,” says astronomer Meredith MacGregor of the University of Colorado Boulder. When one of those cosmic leftovers gets kicked into the inner solar system by a gravitational shove from a planet like Neptune and approaches the sun, it turns into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-rock-comet-centaur-astronomy">an object we recognize as a comet</a> (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p. 14</em>). Comets that circle the sun once only every 200 years or more typically derive from the solar system’s even more distant <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/overview/">repository of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud</a>.</p>

<p>In scientific parlance, the Kuiper Belt is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-dot-exomoon-evidence-exoplanet-moon-stars-astronomy">debris disk</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/28/21</em>). Distant solar systems contain debris disks, too, <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1721a/">scientists have discovered</a>. “They’re absolutely directly analogous to our Kuiper Belt,” MacGregor says.</p>



<p>In 2015, scientists got their first close look at a Kuiper Belt object when NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mission-pluto-live-coverage">New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/15/15</em>). The pictures that New Horizons returned in the following years were thousands of times more detailed than previous observations of Pluto and its moons. No longer just a few fuzzy pixels, the worlds were revealed as rich landscapes of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-volcanoes-pluto-may-have-spewed-organic-rich-water"> ice-spewing volcanoes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-global-maps-pluto-and-charon-show-highs-and-lows">deep, jagged canyons</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/19, p. 12</em>; <em>SN Online: 7/13/18</em>). “I’m just absolutely ecstatic with what we accomplished at Pluto,” says Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and a member of the New Horizons team. “It could not possibly have gone any better.”</p>



<p>But New Horizons wasn’t finished with the Kuiper Belt. On New Year’s Day of 2019, when the spacecraft was almost 1.5 billion kilometers beyond Pluto’s orbit, it flew past another Kuiper Belt object. And what a surprise it was. Arrokoth — its name refers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-gave-ultima-thule-mu69-new-official-name-arrokoth">“sky” in the Powhatan/Algonquian language</a> — looks like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-new-horizons-ultima-thule-mu69-pancakes">a pair of pancakes joined at the hip</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 5</em>; <em>SN: 3/16/19, p. 15</em>). Roughly 35 kilometers long from end to end, it was probably once two separate bodies that gently collided and stuck. Arrokoth’s bizarre structure sheds light on a fundamental question in astronomy: How do gas and dust clump together and grow into larger bodies?</p>



<p>One long-standing theory, called planetesimal accretion, says that a series of collisions is responsible. Tiny bits of material collide and stick together on repeat to build up larger and larger objects, says JJ Kavelaars, an astronomer at the University of Victoria and the National Research Council of Canada. But there’s a problem, Kavelaars says.</p>

<p>As objects get large enough to exert a significant gravitational pull, they accelerate as they approach one another. “They hit each other too fast, and they don’t stick together,” he says. It would be unusual for a large object like Arrokoth, particularly with its two-lobed structure, to have formed from a sequence of collisions.</p>



<p>More likely, Arrokoth was born from a process known as gravitational instability, researchers now believe. In that scenario, a clump of material that happens to be denser than its surroundings grows by pulling in gas and dust. This process can form planets on timescales of thousands of years, rather than the millions of years required for planetesimal accretion. “The timescale for planet formation completely changes,” Kavelaars says.</p>



<p>If Arrokoth formed this way, other bodies in the solar system probably did too. That may mean that parts of the solar system formed much more rapidly than previously believed, says Buie, who discovered Arrokoth in 2014. “Already Arrokoth has rewritten the textbooks on how solar system formation works.”</p>



<p>What they’ve seen so far makes scientists even more eager to study another Kuiper Belt object up close. New Horizons is still making its way through the Kuiper Belt, but time is running out to identify a new object and orchestrate a rendezvous. The spacecraft, which is <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/">currently 53 astronomical units from the sun</a>, is approaching the Kuiper Belt’s outer edge. Several teams of astronomers are using telescopes around the world to search for new Kuiper Belt objects that would make a close pass to New Horizons. “We are definitely looking,” Buie says. “We would like nothing better than to fly by another object.”</p>



<h4>All eyes on the Kuiper Belt</h4>



<p>Astronomers are also getting a wide-angle view of the Kuiper Belt by surveying it with some of Earth’s largest telescopes. At the <a href="https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope</a> on Mauna Kea — the same mountaintop where Jewitt and Luu spotted 1992 QB1 — astronomers recently wrapped up the <a href="http://www.ossos-survey.org/">Outer Solar System Origins Survey</a>. It recorded more than 800 previously unknown Kuiper Belt objects, bringing the total number known to roughly 3,000.</p>

<p>This cataloging work is revealing tantalizing patterns in how these bodies move around the sun, MacGregor says. Rather than being uniformly distributed, the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects tend to be clustered in space. That’s a telltale sign that these bodies got a gravitational shove in the past, she says.</p>



<p>The cosmic bullies that did that shoving, most astronomers believe, were none other than the solar system’s gas giants. In the mid-2000s, scientists first proposed that planets like Neptune and Saturn probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">pinballed toward and away from the sun</a> early in the solar system’s history (<em>SN: 5/5/12, p. 24</em>). That movement explains the strikingly similar orbits of many Kuiper Belt objects, MacGregor says. “The giant planets stirred up all of the stuff in the outer part of the solar system.”</p>



<p>Refining the solar system’s early history requires observations of even more Kuiper Belt objects, says Meg Schwamb, an astronomer at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Researchers expect that a new astronomical survey, slated to begin next year, will find roughly 40,000 more Kuiper Belt objects. The <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a>, being built in north-central Chile, will use its 3,200-megapixel camera to repeatedly photograph the entire Southern Hemisphere sky every few nights for 10 years. That undertaking, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or LSST, will revolutionize our understanding of how the early solar system evolved, says Schwamb, a cochair of the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration.</p>

<p>It’s exciting to think about what we might learn next from the Kuiper Belt, Jewitt says. The discoveries that lay ahead will be possible, in large part, because of advances in technology, he says. “One picture with one of the modern survey cameras is roughly a thousand pictures with our setup back in 1992.”</p>



<p>But even as we uncover more about this distant realm of the solar system, a bit of awe should always remain, Jewitt says. “It’s the largest piece of the solar system that we’ve yet observed.”</p>
