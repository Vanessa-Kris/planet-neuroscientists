<p>Work is getting stale, and you’ve recently been courted by an exciting new company for a great role, the one drawback being a slight pay cut. Before you’ve made up your mind, your manager asks you whether you have plans to go elsewhere. If you wanted to avoid showing your hand, you could lie blatantly. You could change the topic. Or, you could palter: use a truthful statement to create a misleading impression.</p>
<p>“Financially, you’re treating me really well and I don’t think there’s anything out there that could match that.”</p>
<p>Paltering is the topic of a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-59847-001/">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. The authors, Todd Rogers and others at Harvard University, focused on negotiation situations, where access to accurate information had concrete consequences. They found that paltering is fairly common – real-life negotiators reported doing it more frequently then telling a lie, and as commonly as neglecting to share information – and that one reason for this is that they believed it wasn’t such a big deal as lying. In this, they were sadly mistaken.</p>
<p><span id="more-16859"></span></p>
<p>In one experiment, 130 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website imagined trying to use eBay to sell a car with generally positive features but that sometimes mysteriously failed to start. When a prospective customer asked if there were any engine problems, the researchers told some participants to imagine that they parried the question by using a palter: emphasising the (true) fact that the car mostly ran very smoothly. Other participants were asked to play the role of the customer, and to imagine their feelings after discovering this deception post-purchase.</p>
<p>When asked to rate their own honesty in the negotiation, the seller participants rated themselves as 3.4, not too far below the mid-point on the 7-point rating scale. But the buyer participants rated the same transaction as significantly less honest, an average of just 2.5. This makes sense because unlike an outright liar, a palterer has recourse to the justification “I didn’t actually say anything untrue” to maintain their self-image as basically decent, but the victim has the same harsh experience of being deceived, regardless of the method. A follow-up study showed that people feel less comfortable paltering when responding to a direct question, conscious of the fact that their counterpart was explicitly seeking information that was then deliberately denied. But they felt that slipping in misdirection as part of a broader patter was easier to excuse.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at the material consequences of paltering as a form of deception, this time in a more complex negotiation with all participants acting as a seller and subjected to paltering by the buyer. The participants’ task was to sell a plot of land, the worth of which depended on whether it was to be used residentially or for (much more profitable) commercial use. A research assistant acted as a prospective buyer, and participants were encouraged to use part of the discussion to find out what the buyer would use the plot for. The buyer’s true aim was indeed commercial, and in one condition they openly admitted this in response to questioning. In another condition, the buyer overtly lied, claiming the use would be for residential building. And in a third key condition, the buyer paltered: emphasising the true fact that they had only been involved in residential developments to date.</p>
<p>Participants had to make a secret offer, hoping to get the highest sale price they could but knowing that it would be automatically rejected if it was beyond the buyer’s budget. When met with a lie or palter, participants made weaker, more tentative bids, and afterwards reported their suspicion that the buyer didn’t have the budget associated with a commercial bid. When the truth was revealed – the buyer had commercial plans and a big budget – participants judged both acts of deception as equally bad, expressing a disinclination to enter business relations with either type of dissembler in the future. Paltering paid off in the short term, but got punished.</p>
<p>Paltering then, is a form of deception that’s effective at actively leading other parties to false conclusions, just like straight-out lying. Perpetrators can enjoy a sense of plausible deniability, as the statements are technically true, but the harm they cause to their relationships is no less palpable.</p>

            <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/795530330052493312">recently reported</a> that <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/14/037549">one of my papers</a> has been rejected by PLoS Computational Biology after 10 months and 4 revisions, on the ground of general interest. This has generated a little buzz. A colleague mentioned it on his blog. As a result, the editor of my paper contacted him directly to tell his version of the story, which my colleague has now <a href="https://medium.com/@drmdhumphries/thats-another-fine-mess-you-ve-got-us-into-peer-review-b75a9aa11034">reported on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the editor’s story is “misleading”, to be polite. It is a shame that the review process is confidential, as it allows the journal to hide what actually happens behind their closed doors. Nevertheless, I have asked the journal for the authorization to publish the content of my appeal and their response, where I explain what happened in more detail (and more accurately). They have accepted. I have removed names of the persons involved. This illustrates one of the flaws of the current peer-review system (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/my-new-year-resolution-to-help-move-science-to-the-post-journal-world/">this post</a> for how it could work better).</p>
<p>(Just one note: the editor has apparently told my colleague that the third reviewer was a collaborator, so they could not take into account his review. Well, that’s a lie. I know because he chose to sign his review. The "collaboration" was the scientist sending me published data.)</p>
<p>So here it is.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Re: Manuscript PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00007R4</p>
<p>So after 10 months and 4 revisions, our paper has been rejected, following the recommendation of one reviewer, because it is not considered of broad enough interest. I quote from the final editorial message: “We regret that the specific hypothesis that your manuscript is geared to dispute does not reach that level of general interest.”.</p>
<p>These facts being recalled, it should be obvious enough that the editorial process has gone very wrong. There were no more technical criticisms already after revision 2, on July 8th, 4 months ago, and the paper should have been accepted then. I have repeatedly asked the editors to explain why we were required to justify novelty and significance after having been required to do so much work on technical aspects. But the editors have refused to answer this simple query. Frankly, I was expecting a bit more respect for the authors that make this journal, and I do not think that explaining the journal’s policy and the decisions is so much to ask. All I know is Michael Eisen’s view, founding editor of this journal, who has cared to comment “I agree - a paper going out for review should mean it is of interest”.</p>
<p>This editorial process has gone beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my career in terms of absurdity and waste. Why scientists (“peers”) would voluntarily make each other’s life so unnecessarily hard instead of cooperating and debating is beyond my understanding. In the end it appears that the ego of one (important?) reviewer matters more than science, and that is very sad. This being said, I have been notified that appeals are only considered when “a) a reviewer or editor is thought to have made a significant factual error” or “b) his/her objectivity is compromised by a documented competing interest”, and since bureaucracy apparently beats reason and ethics, I will now explain how this applies.</p>
<p>I have already explained at length the factual errors of the first reviewer, who is apparently the only one that is trusted by the editors. This editorial message repeats some of them (no, we are not criticizing simulation results of a particular model, but the biophysical interpretation (what goes on physically), and we did so in several state-of-the-art biophysical models, not one). I will therefore focus on case (b), and attach my previous letter to the editors for reference; please also read the responses to reviewers as regards case (a), in particular to reviewer-editor Dr. YYY who has unfortunately not cared to reply to our point-by-point response that he had required from us. The editorial decisions that have led to rejecting the paper on the basis of general interest after 10 months are so bizarre that I am compelled to question senior editor Dr. YYY’s objectivity – I presume that Dr. XXX, who sent the paper for review in the first place, does consider the paper of interest. The sequence of facts speaks for itself:</p>
<p>- On June 6th (revision #2), the editorial message reads “We understand that Reviewer 2 was very enthusiastic, and Reviewer 3 had relatively minor comments, but we both stress that addressing Reviewer 1's reservations are essential. Indeed, it is only fair to say that it seems to us that it will be challenging to address these comments in the context of the presented results.”. The exclusive reliance on one reviewer and the presumption that we could not address the comments is rather surprising. Nonetheless, the editorial message that followed was exclusively about the match with experimental data, not about interest (“the reviewer's point about (apparently) unrealistic voltage dependencies of the currents […]”). We did successfully address these comments, pointing out that the reviewer had made factual errors (such as misreading the figure he was commenting, and discussing the results of an experimental paper he had not opened).</p>
<p>- On July 8th (revision #3), the editorial message was now asking to explain the novelty compared to what we had done in the past (and published in the same journal), blindly following the 3-sentence report of reviewer #1, and making no mention whatsoever to the fact that we had just answered the major (and flawed) criticisms on experimental observations, which constituted the previous editorial message. At this point we complained that we were asked to justify the novelty of our study 7 months after submission, especially when it was explicit in the introduction; nonetheless, we complied and explained again.</p>
<p>- On August 25th (revision #4), we were appalled to read that, instead of finally accepting the paper, senior editor Dr. YYY decided to nominate himself as a reviewer, admitting that “the latest revision is first one he has had the chance to read”. The report was not an assessment of the novelty of the paper, as would have been logical since this was what the previous editorial message was about. Instead, it was a 6 pages long report full of technical queries, making negative criticisms that, for most of them, had already been addressed in previous reports, and asking for substantial modifications of the paper.</p>
<p>- At this point, I replied to the editorial message and obtained no response; as the message stated “If you would like to discuss anything, please don't hesitate to contact either of us directly”, I emailed Dr. YYY, and he started his response as follows: “To answer your email, allow me to be brief, because this sort of exchange should really be going through the journal, and indeed that will be the case from now on.”. Nonetheless, we exchanged a few emails, in which he offered no explanation; in the end we agreed that I would write a point-by-point response to his six-page review, but not modify the paper. I submitted it, together with a response to the first reviewer, and a letter to the editors, on September 22nd.</p>
<p>- Three weeks later, on October 10th, I received a message where I was asked to edit the letter so that it could be passed on to the reviewers. Apparently the editors had not noticed the response to reviewers. It still took them three weeks to read a letter, which, considering the history of this paper, does not strike me as very respectful. I complained to Dr. YYY, who replied “We believe that you have been adequately notified by the PLoS administrative team concerning the status of your revision.”. I had to exchange several emails with Dr. XXX who realized the error. I received no apology from Dr. YYY.</p>
<p>- On November 11th, I received the reject decision, together with the response of reviewer #1 and, oddly enough, of reviewer #3 to which I had not replied (since there was no remaining comment). He also was surprised, since he wrote “I don’t have the expertise, authority or, honestly, the time to judge whether the new comments from Reviewers 1 &amp; 4 are fair, or whether the authors’ responses have fully addressed them – this is clearly a job for the Editors (although hopefully not for the Editor who just became a Reviewer)”. But, editor-reviewer #4 Dr. YYY did not bother replying to my point-by-point response, which he had explicitly required.</p>
<p>- The final decision comes with excuses that are frankly hard to swallow. One is that the editors had failed to see the word “models” in the title. In 10 months and 4 revisions! Who can seriously believe that? And yes, the paper is about models – it is a computational biology journal (note that we have also successfully related the models to experimental observations, on request of the editors). The other excuse is that an anonymous reviewer (reviewer #2) had a conflict of interest and his reviews had to be dismissed. I am of course fine with that decision (let me simply state for the record that none of reviewers I have suggested are in such a position). But this happened in April, more than 6 months ago. Quite appropriately, the editor Dr. XXX asked for another reviewer who identified himself (Dr. ZZZ). Dr. ZZZ wrote a positive review, and in addition he read our responses to the other reviewers and wrote “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.”. At this point, given that no objection had been raised by any reviewer or editor on methods, results or clarity, the paper should have been accepted. Instead, the editors decided to follow a nonsensical comment from reviewer #1 alone: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists”, which was not even consistent with his/her own first positive assessment (“this is an interesting paper”). Given that Dr. XXX sent the paper for review in the first place, this decision must originate from Dr. YYY (who at this point had not read the paper, by his own admission). I am compelled to conclude that Dr. YYY has not been objective, and in fact has been actively blocking our paper. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I witness the questionable attitude of Dr. YYY, as he has recently been a reviewer for an essay I wrote. The review process was extremely long, went over multiple rounds with massive lists of requests, where Dr. YYY basically wanted to rewrite the text to follow his own views and style. During the review process, Dr. YYY contacted me directly by email to discuss the paper, going so far as asking for co-authorship (“Indeed, the level of suggestions are approaching collaboration on this paper- something I would be happy with but I assume is not what you have in mind.”). In the same email, and while the review process was not over, he asked me for an experimental collaboration – which of course I have not followed up. I had to ask the editor to intervene to stop the madness – which he did: “Indeed your paper has been unduly delayed and I have asked the reviewer to answer me within 24 hours.”. I apologize for disclosing these email excerpts, but I have no other choice since I am asked to provide documentation. It is clear that, had I imagined that Dr. YYY could be chosen as a reviewer (which seemed unlikely given his recent track record), I would have opposed him. But I did not anticipate that he would nominate himself, or overthrow the editor’s decision without even reading my paper (by his own admission).</p>
<p>Therefore, I am asking that Dr. YYY is replaced by a new senior editor with a more reasonable attitude.</p>
<p>As far as I can see: 1) the three reviewers were initially positive on the interest of the paper; 2) the editor Dr. XXX, who as far as I can tell is the only scientist involved in this process who is a member of the computational biology community, supported our paper since he sent it for review; 3) one reviewer, who seems to be an experimental electrophysiologist (unfortunately he or she has decided to remain anonymous), reverted his subjective opinion on the paper’s interest after we have pointed out the errors in his/her report, and even then, still judged the paper interesting for the computational neuroscience community. I have failed to see to how the decision is “not trivial to reach”.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Attached: Letter to the editors from September 16th</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Letter to the editors, September 16th</strong></p>
<p>Dear Editors,</p>
<p>In the previous revision, I raised serious objections regarding the abusive attitude of reviewer #1. These objections have apparently been completely dismissed, but what I have been most disappointed about is the total lack of response to these objections. I am writing this letter in the hope that this time it will be given some consideration.</p>
<p>This manuscript has been submitted 8 months ago. This is the fourth major revision that we have been asked to make. The responses are now totaling more than 25 pages, much longer than the article itself. We have now entered a phase where a large part of the responses consist in citing previous revisions where the issues have already been addressed. This revision reaches a new level, where a fourth reviewer is added and repeats mostly questions that we have already answered in previous revisions. Why a fourth reviewer is considered necessary after 8 months of revision is not clear, when none of the three reviewers has raised any serious concern.</p>
<p>I have officially asked a detailed explanation for this peculiar decision. The only response I have obtained so far is that there was “a tie” between “conflicting reviews”. So apparently the editorial decision has been based on a vote between reviewers. This is yet what I read on the journal’s website:</p>
<p><i>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comment that may help the editors to make a decision. That said, decisions are not necessarily made according to majority rule. Instead, the editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers. </i></p>
<p>If one followed this process, then one would realize that:</p>
<p>- None of the three reviewers has any remaining objection about results, methods, or clarity of the text.</p>
<p>- Reviewer #2 and #3 have an overall very positive assessment of the paper and in particular of its interest. Rev #2: “This is a great revision. The authors have clarified and addressed all my previous concerns. […] I strongly believe the study is publishable as it stands”; Rev# 3: “This is a very clear and logically presented manuscript dealing with a key question in fundamental cellular neuroscience”.</p>
<p>- On his/her first report, reviewer #1 also made a positive assessment of the paper and of its interest: “This is a clearly written manuscript that addresses an interesting question regarding the nature of spike initiation. Specifically, the authors propose a plausible explanation […] This is an interesting paper.”.</p>
<p>- After two rounds of technical revisions, in which we pointed out the reviewer’s errors and to which no objection has been made, reviewer #1 changed his mood and now concludes, without any argument: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (sic).</p>
<p>- Reviewer #3 has read our responses to the two other reviewers and concluded: “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.” From these facts, it appears clearly that there are in fact 3 convergent reviews. All 3 reviewers have concluded that results and methods are rigorous and the text is well written. All 3 reviewers have found the paper interesting. It might be that reviewer #1 has “voted” negatively; however I would expect the editorial decision to be based on the content of reviews and responses, which in this case is convergent, and not on the mood of one reviewer, which in this case is inconsistent between the reports. It is my understanding that an editorial decision should be based on arguments and facts, not on the reviewer’s emotions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have replied in detail, again, to all criticisms. We have pointed out in particular the factual errors of reviewer #1. To help the editors, we have underlined the important points. We would appreciate if the editors checked for themselves whether reviewer #1 is right or not. We have also replied to reviewer/senior editor Dr YYY, although I deeply regret that this fourth version is “the first one he has had the chance to read”.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to call your attention on the conclusion of reviewer #1, on which his/her recommendation is based, which requires in my opinion a clarification from the journal: “Finally, now in their third revision, the authors acknowledge that this work strongly builds on the previous resistive-coupling hypothesis, and tests whether this hypothesis is compatible with sharp spike onset (a view they have already proposed), vs the alternative proposed by Yu, of back propagation. This very specific theoretical result I feel is unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (Please see also our response, pointing out that the said acknowledgement was clear already in the very first version.)</p>
<p>This recommendation makes some important presumptions about this journal’s editorial views. Therefore I would very much like to know if this journal:</p>
<p>- also considers that proposing a hypothesis is more important than testing one, and that only the former should be published;</p>
<p>- considers that interesting computational neuroscience studies do not belong to this journal. I would also very much like to know if this journal considers that it is ok for a reviewer to ask for substantial technical revisions when he/she has already decided that the paper should not be published anyway. This has been indeed a lot of work for a decision ultimately based on the mood of one reviewer.</p>
<p>As I have argued in this letter, it is very clear that, given the content of the reports of the 3 reviewers and of our responses, this manuscript should have been accepted already. After 8 months and 4 revisions, and no serious objection on the manuscript, I can only hope very much that this journal does not confuse rigorous peer review with author harassment.</p>
<p>Again, I am hoping that this letter will be seriously taken into consideration, and even perhaps responded to.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p><strong>Response of the editors-in-chief</strong></p>
<p>Dear Dr. Brette,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response to the recent decision on your paper “The Basis of Sharp Spike Onset in Standard Biophysical Models”. The manuscript and your appeal letter have been carefully evaluated by Dr. XXX and the journal’s Editors-in-Chief.</p>
<p>We understand your frustration regarding the length and complexity of the review process, and we would like to apologize for the time taken to reach a final decision.</p>
<p>We would like to provide some further clarification on how the editorial decision was reached. The manuscript addresses the issue - how do cortical neuronal action potentials rise so sharply? – and after an initial evaluation, Dr. XXX found it interesting enough to merit sending out for review, so that the reviewers could assess the technical solidity of the work and the conceptual advance proposed. The paper received mixed reviews, and hence merited a revision. After several rounds of revision, Reviewer 1 remained unconvinced. In order to aid the review process, Dr. YYY volunteered to evaluate the paper in depth, and his opinion concurred with that of Reviewer 1. Dr. XXX also re-read the paper and came to the conclusion that this manuscript is critically close conceptually to the previous PLOS publications - in fact the idea was laid out clearly and beautifully in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers. The present manuscript is an implementation of this idea, showing that other biophysically realistic models used to examine the spike sharpness issue show the mechanism that was suggested in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers.</p>
<p>We regret that this did not become fully clear before the third revision, and we understand your disappointment with the final outcome.</p>
<p>However, we agree that the findings of the paper are not significant enough for PLOS Computational Biology, and we will not be reconsidering the paper. We are sorry not to be more encouraging, but we hope that you can understand the reasons for this decision.</p>

            <img alt="A microsite and material found in a microsite" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Cullen-BMC_Blog-microsite_image-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>When we think about the distributions and community ecology of terrestrial vertebrates today, we generally find that large-bodied species (e.g. deer, bison, caribou, wolves) tend to be found across a very large area. White-tailed deer, for example, are found from Central America to southern Canada. Another example is the grey wolf, which historically ranged throughout most of North America, Asia, and Europe, from the high arctic to the sub-tropics. These broad distributions suggest a tolerance to environmental differences on the part of large-bodied species.</p>
<p>An interesting and perplexing pattern in the palaeoecological record is that large-bodied dinosaurs, at least in the Cretaceous of North America, do not appear to have followed this trend of very broad distributions. During this time, North America was often bisected by a large shallow sea (the Western Interior Seaway), and dinosaurs in western North America lived on a relatively narrow strip of land (sometimes referred to as Laramidia).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8158" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Paleogeography of North America during the Late Cretaceous (∼75 Ma)" class="wp-image-8158 size-large" height="786" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/journal.pone_.0012292.g001-834x1024.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Paleogeography of North America during the Late Cretaceous (∼75 Ma)</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Sampson et al. 2010. PLoS ONE 5(9): e12292</div></figure>
<p>A long-standing explanation for the high diversity of dinosaurs across this relatively small landmass is that they were highly sensitive to environmental differences (particularly distance from the sea), and as a result different large-bodied species would share non-overlapping ranges despite sometimes being found less than a few hundred kilometres apart.</p>
<p>Our goal was to test this hypothesis of dinosaur environmental sensitivity. We wanted to see if in two environmentally different, but time equivalent settings, dinosaurs showed ecologically distinct trends in occurrence and abundance. To do this, we needed to show what the overall pattern in vertebrate community structure was in these two settings, and in the broader context of environmental change over time in this region.</p>
<p>We collected data from dozens of vertebrate microfossil sites (or microsites for short). Microsites are concentrations of small vertebrate fossils representing a palaeocommunity from a short time interval, and are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/origins-of-microfossil-bonebeds-insights-from-the-upper-cretaceous-judith-river-formation-of-north-central-montana/06F4B6D9881C06B6D98EBC94F5C43C04">thought to have formed in low energy ponds and rivers</a>, acting as sink for material from the region. The relative abundance of different groups can be counted and compared between sites to identify how the community is changing temporally, geographically, and environmentally.</p>
<p>All of the microsites we analyzed were collected from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, in two geographically distinct sampling areas, and all from a geological unit called the <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/e93-016#.WCX0fOErJE4">Belly River Group</a>. Sediments of this unit record a transition from marine to terrestrial setting, which is followed by a mostly terrestrial component (reconstructed primarily as an upper coastal plain, like inland Louisiana today), and finally a shift back to more marine influence (a lower coastal plain, similar to the Mississippi delta of southern Louisiana).</p>
<p>Due to the depositional history of the area, there is a time-equivalent interval where one of the sampling regions records a lower coastal plain environment, and the other sampling region records an upper coastal plain environment. This provides the temporally equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in which to test our hypotheses.</p>
<p>We found that the relative abundances of vertebrates in the palaeocommunities preserved in these microsites changed in response to fluctuations in sea level. The largest change was an inverse shift in abundance between sharks/rays and amphibians, with the former dominant in marine-influenced intervals and the latter dominant in terrestrial-influenced intervals. While not surprising, that result confirms that these communities are responding to environmental changes, and that our analyses can detect that.</p>
<p>The next step was to analyze sub-sets of the data, specifically the time-equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in the two sampling areas. We found that dinosaurs, and particularly large-bodied groups, did not vary to any noticeable degree in their relative abundances through this time-equivalent interval. In fact they were highly similar in abundances in both environments.</p>

<p>Our results indicate that this long held notion of dinosaurs being highly sensitive to environment and sea-level may not be correct. But then what explains the high diversity of large-bodied dinosaur species present across the Cretaceous of North America? Some of the distant regions of western North America may <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rCDYCQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=sullivan+lucas+2006&amp;ots=c__sAkVIJ2&amp;sig=KnMPdsSfJwEc-TzKgLbSxA6N5XM#v=onepage&amp;q=sullivan%20lucas%202006&amp;f=false">not be as geologically time-equivalent as we currently think</a>, or were isolated geographically in some way that prevented migration.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that despite not being particularly sensitive environmentally, that dinosaurs were partitioning their ecological niches in other ways that allowed for this diversity, such as a <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6785-13-14">restriction on feeding heights</a> or a dietary preference for particular plants. Perhaps primary productivity during this time was sufficiently high that competition was lower and strict niche partitioning was not required.</p>
<p>Our study addresses a long-standing question in dinosaur ecology, though it alone cannot provide the full answer. Many dinosaur teeth can only be diagnosed to the family or subfamily, not the species. So while we focused on trends in major dinosaur groups, additional work must be done to locate more of the much rarer dinosaur macrofossils in order to completely address what is driving dinosaur species distributions.</p>

<p>The traffic lights turn amber: should you brake or accelerate on through? If there’s a teenager at the wheel, the chances are he or she will put their foot down and keep going. Teenagers love taking risks, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896475/">more so than any other age group</a>. This is partly down to the immaturity of the teen brain: they do not yet show the same connectivity between frontal decision making areas and deeper reward-related brain areas, as compared with adults. But there’s also a social element. When an adult is around, teens tend to take fewer risks, and their brains show less reward-related activity after taking a risk, a phenomenon that psychologists call “social scaffolding” because it is as if the adult presence is helping the teen to attain adult-like behaviour. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12484/abstract">new study</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em> builds on these findings and makes the claim that a teenager’s brain is influenced to a greater extent by the presence of his or her mother than by an unfamiliar adult. <span id="more-16708"></span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<p>João Moreira and his colleagues scanned the brains of 23 15-year-olds (9 girls) while they played a risk-based game that involved going through a set of 26 traffic lights as quickly as possible and deciding at each set whether to accelerate or brake as the lights turned amber. Accelerating saved time usually, but also carried the risk of a crash which would lead to a greater delay than braking. The teens played the game twice: once in the presence of their mother who was located in the scan control room, and the other time in the presence of an unfamiliar female professor who was described as an expert in adolescent driving behaviour (some played the game with mum present first, others with the stranger present first).</p>
<p>There was a tendency for the teens to take fewer risks when their mum was present, as compared with the professor, but this difference didn’t reach statistical significance. However, at a neural level there were statistically significant differences between the conditions: when mum was present, the teens’ brains showed more reward-related brain activity after making safe decisions and less reward-related brain activity after making risky decisions. Mum’s supervision seemed to make caution a more pleasurable approach, at least at a neural level.</p>
<p>There was also an important difference between conditions in terms of the functional connectivity between decision making and reward-related brain regions in the brain. In the mum condition, but not the adult stranger condition, there was a negative correlation in the activity between these regions: a more mature pattern typical of that seen in adults.</p>
<p>Finally, the teens’ brains showed more activity in regions associated with perspective-taking when taking risks in the mum condition, perhaps suggesting they were concerned with what she might think.</p>
<p>The researchers interpreted their findings as suggesting there is something unique about the influence of a parent (or a mother, at least) on the way a teenager’s brain processes risk, which could have practical implications. For example risk-prevention educational programmes for teenagers, which often struggle to make a difference, might be more likely to be effective if parents are directly involved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study is hampered by several methodological issues such as the small sample size and the lack of a baseline control condition: the latter means it’s not clear if differences between the conditions are caused by the benefits of a mother’s presence or the opposite effect of an unfamiliar adult. Also, many issues are left unanswered, such as: would a father have the same apparent effect as a mother? And does the quality of the parent-teen relationship matter?</p>

<p>As one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in clinical practice, neck pain is a common topic in <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em>. However, this case report by Mourad and colleagues describes a patient presenting with neck pain, occipital headache and dizziness, which diagnostic imaging revealed to be caused by a basilar impression (an upward displacement of vertebral elements into the foramen magnum as a result of bone softening) rather than a musculoskeletal cause. Although fairly uncommon it can be dangerous as congenital basilar impression often remains asymptomatic and undiagnosed into adulthood. When symptomatic, neck pain is one of its most ubiquitous symptoms occurring in 59% of patients. This case report highlights the importance of considering non-musculoskeletal, rare pathologic disorders such as basilar impression within the screening and differential diagnosis of neck pain. It also demonstrates the capability of physiotherapists to screen for pathologic medical conditions and identify when patient’s symptoms are beyond the scope of physiotherapy.</p>

<p>In January, Dunning and colleagues published the first randomized control trial which compared the effectiveness of manipulation versus mobilization paired with cranio-cervical flexion exercise in ameliorating symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache (headaches arising from musculoskeletal dysfunctions in the cervical spine). The study investigated the issue of best practice in the treatment of these headaches, which has been contentious due to the potential risks associated with manipulation.</p>
<p>The findings demonstrated that manipulation produced significantly greater reductions in headache intensity, frequency and duration as well as reductions in disability and medication intake when compared with mobilization and exercise. The study provides a baseline for treatment of cervicogenic headache, which suggests manipulation as the more efficacious in terms of symptom reduction, and also indicates the need for further research to determine the relative effectiveness of different types and dosages of manipulation.</p>

This systematic review synthesized evidence from 13 observational studies (417 shoulders) on intra- and peri-articular pathophysiologic changes seen in patients affected by primary frozen shoulder. The findings highlight that the anterior shoulder structures are the areas of greatest pathologic change in this condition. However, the study also identified that a lack of evidence with a low risk of bias, non-standardized inclusion criteria and poorly reported study characteristics preclude the production of comparable results and therefore a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of primary frozen shoulder. Ryan and colleagues suggest that a consensus regarding inclusion criteria is required before future studies can investigate tissue changes at defined stages to better understand the disease continuum and inform stage-specific management of this condition.</p>

<p>Khan et al. described the results of a longitudinal cohort study and provided the first independent longitudinal association between increasing severity of meniscal tears and worsening knee pain. It also validated previous studies by demonstrating the majority of meniscal tears (55/63) affected the medial meniscus, where the medial posterior site was the most prevalent tear location. Additionally, this study identified risk factors for tear worsening, including high BMI and osteophytes at first visit, which provides a baseline for recognizing patients where tears are likely to increase in severity. Significantly, this study showed that 16% of tears consistently increased in severity over the 8 year follow-up period, highlighting the importance of early effective management.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that patients with medially located tendon pain and a thickened plantaris close the medial Achilles tendon were often unresponsive to standard scraping treatment. Masci and colleagues demonstrated the effective use of a novel imaging technique [Ultrasound Tissue Characterization (UTC)] to diagnose involvement of the plantaris tendon in patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The UTC algorithms allow quantification of the tendon integrity by categorizing grey scale changes into 4 different echo-types related to matrix integrity. These are then characterized on a scale from intact to completely disorganized. This is visualized in the figure below from the publication, which shows focal disorganized echopixels medially (in images A and B), while image C shows the less frequent observation of general disorganized echopixels in both medial and lateral parts.</p>
<p>Although ultrasound and color Doppler indicated plantaris tendon involvement in 20/23 cases, UTC revealed disorganized changes in the medial Achilles midportion in all patients. These changes may indirectly indicate involvement of the plantaris tendon due to its compression on the medial aspect of the Achilles tendon. This study demonstrated the effective utilization of a novel technology (UTC) and addressed the need to diagnose plantaris tendon involvement to inform future clinical management of patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy.</p>

<p>It’s that time of year when many of us are trying our best to begin a new exercise habit. One psychological factor affecting our chances is how we think we’ll feel during the exercise, and how that compares to the way we actually feel when we get going, and how we feel afterwards. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991804">new study</a> in <em>Health Psychology</em> has explored whether it’s possible to increase people’s adherence to a new exercise regime by making their expectations more positive. While the main intervention was a disappointment, there is an encouraging message in the results: moderate-to-vigorous exercise is likely to be more enjoyable than you think, and simply knowing this will probably help you enjoy your exercise even more.</p>
<p><span id="more-16600"></span></p>
<p>Bethany Kwan at University of Colorado School of Medicine and her colleagues recruited 101 healthy young men and women aged 18 to 45. None of them were elite or professional athletes. Their initial challenge was to run for 30 minutes on a treadmill in the lab (at a sustained target intensity of 90 to 100 per cent of their heart rate when first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilatory_threshold">out of breath</a>), and to say how they were feeling at several points throughout and afterwards. The researchers then asked them to repeat the same amount of exercise each day for the next seven days, with their adherence assessed via a heart monitor.</p>
<p>Before the participants began, the researchers asked them how they expected to feel during the exercise. Crucially, the researchers manipulated the expectations of one third of the participants in a positive manner by telling them that most people exercising at this intensity feel good and energised, and then relaxed afterward. In contrast, they told another third of the participants that most people find this intensity of exercise negative and unpleasant, and then they feel tired afterward. The expectations of the remainder of the participants was not manipulated and they acted as controls. After their lab run, the participants said how strongly they intended to keep up the week-long regimen of exercise.</p>
<p>Kwan and her team had hoped that by increasing the positivity of participants’ exercise expectations that these individuals would not only find the lab exercise more positive during and afterwards, but would then show stronger intentions to exercise and better adherence to the regimen. The results were a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Overall, participants found the lab run more pleasant than they thought they would. But participants who were manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable did not exercise more through the following week. In this sense, the main intervention was a failure.</p>
<p>However, participants manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable showed greater increases in positive feelings through the run compared to the negatively manipulated participants; moreover, compared with control participants, they remembered the run as less fatiguing. This last effect, though tentative, could be important because the more positively participants remembered the lab run, the more they tended to run through the ensuing week. This supports the common sense idea that when you’ve finished your exercise, it could be beneficial to focus on those aspects of the experience you enjoyed: doing so might increase the likelihood you’ll give it another go.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results suggest that “healthy individuals will likely find a moderate-to-vigorous exercise stimulus to be more pleasant than they expect it to be” and that encouraging exercisers to focus on the positive aspects of the exercise experience will likely “yield an overall more positive affective experience”. Hopefully the mere act of reading this article will help, by raising your expectations for your own new regime!</p>

 Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted for ubiquitination and Ddb1–cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is, YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate.

            <p>Males of many polygynous species compete for access to fertile females without providing them with resources other than sperm and without investing in care for the offspring (male dominance polygyny). In such systems, local competition for access to females is intense and typically only a few males obtain matings, leading to strong sexual selection. Sampling multiple breeding areas could then provide a mechanism for males to increase their chances to reproduce. However, little is known about such sampling behaviour and about the spatial scale at which males compete. Here we show that most males of a migratory, polygynous shorebird, the pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), that arrived at a known breeding location in northern Alaska subsequently moved through a considerable part of the entire species’ breeding range (up to 13,045 km in a four-week period), sampling as many as 23 additional potential breeding sites. Our data suggest that males do not have a final breeding destination after migration from their wintering quarters, but make nomadic movements that are probably not a consequence of breeding failure. Tenure, the duration of stay at a site, correlated strongly with the number of breeding females at the site, suggesting that decisions to leave are dependent on local mating opportunities. Nomadic movements may allow males to display and sire offspring at multiple sites within a single breeding season. Sexual selection may then favour high-performance males that are able to reduce sleep to compete locally and to fly long distances between breeding sites, leading to a population with unrestricted interbreeding and without local adaptation and speciation.</p><p>Nature  1 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20813">doi: 10.1038/nature20813</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/8GAdgazZlu4" width="1" />

            <p>Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization—a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl–B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib—a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis—was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20800">doi: 10.1038/nature20800</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/vAQPhs6sNjs" width="1" />

 Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.

<p>A little humor in the workplace appears broadly beneficial: it can increase <a href="http://www.apple.com">productivity</a> and creativity and helps to <a href="http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/laugh-and-workplace-laughs-with-you.html">build trust</a>. But before you get too carried away attempting to stun your colleagues with your wit, you might want to heed the findings from <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-54537-001/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, which focused on the effect of humour attempts on our personal status. The work shows that while a well-judged gag can cover us in glory, misses can have negative consequences. What’s more, this risky nature partly explains why we hold funny people in esteem.</p>
<p><span id="more-16584"></span></p>
<p>An initial study had a decidedly scatological bent. The researchers Brad Bitterly, Alison Wood Brooks, and Maurice Schweitzer asked participants to make up customer testimonials for a company that specialised in pet waste removal. Afterwards each participant listened to testimonials supposedly made up by other participants and judged the calibre of the person who’d written them. For instance, one testimonial began: “Very professional. After cleaning up the poop, they weren’t even upset when they found out that I don’t have a pet!” Participants gave higher ratings of status, competence and confidence to participants who delivered a funny “faecestimonial”, compared to their straight-faced counterparts.</p>
<p>Next the researchers investigated what happens when jokes fall flat. Nearly 300 participants read about a hypothetical job interview where a candidate responded to a question either with a straight answer or with an attempt at humour. When the humour was successful – the manager laughed – the candidate was perceived as higher status, but there was no advantage when the moment was followed by stony silence. It seems a flopped joke doesn’t help your status, but doesn’t lower it either. But what happens when the humour isn’t just weak, but also inappropriate?</p>
<p>In another study – a rehash of the job interview scenario – a cheeky candidate replied to a question with a tasteless “that’s what she said” sexual innuendo. Candidates that attempted the joke and were met with silence were judged the most harshly, rated as low status and incompetent. Those who won a laugh (suggesting the attempt wasn’t entirely misjudged) were still rated lower than candidates who didn’t make a crass joke. A repeat of the experiment with a different tasteless joke reinforced the finding: inappropriate humour is a poor gambit that leaves you worse off than forgoing the opportunity.</p>
<p>According to Bitterly and his colleagues, the fact that joke-telling harbours risk is partly why it commands our appreciation. To correctly gauge the right humour for your audience and nail the delivery requires competence. Moreover, the mere act of attempting a joke betrays confidence because of the fact that it can easily backfire. Indeed, jokers were always rated as more confident, even when the jokes were misjudged and failed to produce their intended effect. To some extent, this explains why failed jokes (when in good taste) didn’t significantly change status, as they betray low competence but redress this somewhat through showing confidence.</p>
<p>Bitterly’s team suggest that “many individuals may be missing opportunities to project confidence, demonstrate their competence, and increase their status” by making attempts at tasteful humour. But how to avoid backfires? Humour usually involves some break with the expected or permitted, most often a social norm, but also absurdist humour that subverts reality itself, like Mitch Hedberg’s “My fake plants died, because I did not pretend to water them”. According to Bitterly’s group (<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/3/407/">and other humour scholars</a>), the key to successful joke telling is to ensure your audience understands the threat is benign, rather than indicating genuine anti-social or confused thinking. When the joke leads people to wonder if you endorse the sentiment, or that you are providing cover for people that do, then they are liable to think less of you… even if you’ve perfected your comic</p>
<p>– timing.</p>

<p>A considerable body of research exists on the evolution of the species domesticated by humans over the last few thousand years. But what about those species that scientists have domesticated much more recently, such as the classic laboratory model species <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>?</p>
<p>Craig Stanley Jr. and Rob Kulathinal at Temple University conducted the first study of behavioural differences between wild and lab-strains of <em>Drosophila</em>. They confirmed that lab-reared flies are considerably less active than wild-caught flies. Genomic comparisons of five lab strains with the wild-type genome suggests these changes are not just due to accumulations of deleterious mutations caused by inbreeding. Instead, a distinct pattern of genetic changes across the five strains supports the idea that these traits have been selected for. Early geneticists may have unconsciously selected for flies with lower activity by breeding the individuals that were easiest for them to catch and manipulate, creating the distinct domestic phenotype we see today.</p>
<p>Rob Kulathinal discussed the research in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/01/26/the-taming-of-the-fly/">on our blog</a> in January.</p>
<p><strong>Survival of the oldest</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0646-8">Why are some species older than others? A large-scale study of vertebrates</a></p>
<p>Why do some species persist for longer than others? ‘Living fossils’ like the coelacanth and the frilled shark have survived for tens of millions of years, yet many other species arise and become extinct in far shorter periods of time. A team of researchers at the University of Lausanne sought to discover common factors shared by long-lived species.</p>
<p>Comparing 600 vertebrate species, the researchers compared species age with a number of life-history factors, while controlling for evolutionary relationships. Species with varying colored individuals, those that give birth to live young, and/or those that live at low latitudes were the most resilient to past environmental changes.</p>
<p>Aside from satisfying our evolutionary curiosities, this research could also be useful to conservationists. Species which have persisted through long periods of past climatic changes will, presumably, be more resilient to future climatic changes. Conversely then, we can predict that species lacking the life-history factors common to many long-lived species are potentially the most vulnerable to the effects of future climate change.</p>

<p>The black sparrowhawk has successfully colonised the urban environment of South Africa’s Cape Town in recent years, with around 50 pairs now breeding there. Their new environment has brought challenges however, including a particularly aggressive neighbour: the Egyptian goose. Egyptian geese find black sparrowhawk nests ideal to lay their own eggs in and will often take over occupied nests; at twice their size, and with an aggressive temperament, there is little a sparrowhawk can do to prevent a goose from usurping their nest.</p>
<p>In response, sparrowhawks have developed a new tactic to deal with covetous geese: build a lot of nests. Sparrowhawks in territories that had previously experienced nest usurpation by geese built significantly more nests than pairs with no experience of usurpation. This tactic seems to be successful; sparrowhawks that build multiple nests largely overcome the deficit in reproductive success experienced by other individuals breeding in territories with geese activity that do not build multiple nests.</p>
<p>We discussed this research in more detail <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/05/09/hawk-vs-goose-cope-unpleasant-neighbour/">on our blog</a> in May.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic tug-of-war linked to evolution of gay beetles</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0658-4">Sexually antagonistic selection on genetic variation underlying both male and female same-sex sexual behaviour</a></p>
<p>Same-sex sexual behaviors (SSBs) do not readily conform to classical evolutionary models: what adaptive benefit can such behavior have? SSBs are often explained as perception errors; males mistake other males for females and attempt to mate with them. This is less of a persuasive argument in species, like the seed beetle, where females also engage in SSBs. Instead, researchers at the University of Uppsala presented evidence that SSBs in these beetles reflect an underlying evolutionary tug-of-war between the sexes.</p>
<p>The researchers selectively bred beetle lines that exhibited higher rates of SSBs. Both males and females in these lines showed higher mobility than wild-type beetles. For males this resulted in higher reproductive success, presumably as they could mate with more females. For females though, the opposite was true; higher mobility was linked to lower reproductive success.</p>
<p>This suggests that there is a pleiotropic effect underlying the evolution of SSBs; the same genes linked to SSBs are also linked to increased mobility and so, for males, can be adaptive. Presumably this evolutionary benefit for males outweighs the damage it does to their sisters, who show SSBs without any accompanying adaptive benefits.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0691-3">Mixed messages: wild female bonobos show high variability in the timing of ovulation in relation to sexual swelling patterns</a></p>
<p>In many primate species, females signal their willingness to mate through sexual swellings of their genitalia. In most primates these sexual swellings are an honest signal of a female’s ability to conceive, enabling males to focus their reproductive efforts on receptive females. In bonobo chimps however, these signals appear to be rather less honest.</p>
<p>Researchers tracked the timing and duration of sexual swellings in wild bonobo females and, by also collecting urine samples during this time, examined their correlation with the actual time of ovulation. Duration of sexual swellings varied considerably (from 1-31 days) and, moreover, there was no correlation between ovulation and the maximal swelling period.</p>
<p>In bonobos then, female sexual swellings are not an honest signal to males. This may explain why bonobo males do not engage in aggressive guarding of females during their swelling period, as is the case with other primates. In turn, this could be one of the reasons behind bonobo’s famously peaceful society: lies help to keep the peace.</p>

One limitation of these studies is that they generally cannot determine if social network structures persist across multiple generations. If they do not, then evolutionary processes, such as the evolution of cooperation, could not take place; a cooperative strategy that exploits aspects of the social network in one generation might not be successful in the next, preventing it from persisting in the population.</p>
<p>The difficulty of testing cross-generation social network stability partly arises from the species being studied, often long-lived mammals like whales and primates. To follow the social structure of these species through multiple generations would be a considerable challenge. This is why the research group of Tom Tregenza at Exeter University focused on crickets for their study of social network stability.</p>
<p>Do crickets have social networks? Yes, in the sense of networks of social interactions between individuals that either mate with or fight each other. Tracking a population of wild crickets across eight generations, the researchers found that the social networks in any given year were able to predict the structure of networks in other years, regardless of how far apart those years were in time. Thus, it appears that cricket social structures are indeed persistent across generations and that evolutionary processes relying on network structure could take place.</p>
<p>While the researchers caution that their methods may not scale up to larger population sizes, this work was a big step forward for the study of animal social networks.</p>

<p>Hadrosaur dinosaurs, the dominant herbivores of the late Cretaceous period, had arguably the most complex dentition of any vertebrate that has ever existed. Each jaw ramus contained a battery of up to 300 teeth consisting of multiple generations of small, vertically-stacked teeth interlocked with neighbouring teeth. Surprisingly though, the development of these batteries conforms to a simple evolutionary model.</p>
<p>Aaron LeBlanc and colleagues undertook the first comprehensive, tissue-level study of dental ontogeny in hadrosaurids. They made use of modern techniques to create a three-dimensional view of the arrangements of the enamel and dental attachment tissues in unworn teeth in order to understand the development and function of the dental battery.</p>
<p>Their findings show that the complex teeth batteries did not involve the evolution of any unique dental tissues. Instead the novelty of hadrosaur dentition came in how ancestral reptilian dental tissues were utilised in the interactions between individual teeth and between families of teeth; in a way somewhat analogous to how medieval chain mail was constructed.</p>
<p><strong>Male and female cats respond differently to distressed kittens</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0718-9">Female cats, but not males, adjust responsiveness to arousal in the voice of kittens</a></p>
<p>Like many mammals, when separated from their mother kittens begin to cry. Previous research by a team led by Marina Scheumann at Hannover University demonstrated that the auditory content of these messages varies between a ‘low arousal’ state (when a kitten is just spatially separated from its mother) and a ‘high arousal’ state (when a kitten is also manipulated by the researchers). In this new paper, they looked to see if these changes in the kitten distress call are actually detectable by their mothers.</p>
<p>Female cats did indeed modify their response to recordings of kitten cries according to their urgency, responding around 10% faster to high arousal calls. Surprisingly, experience with actually raising kittens did not affect this; virgin female cats responded as quickly as experienced mothers did.</p>
<p>Another surprising finding of the study was that male cats – who play no role in rearing offspring – reacted as quickly as females to cries of kittens in the low arousal state. However, unlike females, male cats did not respond more quickly to urgent, high arousal calls. This implies an inbuilt genetic difference in how the sexes respond to the emotional content of a kitten distress call.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0786-x">Phylogenomic analysis of carangimorph fishes reveals flatfish asymmetry arose in the blink of an evolutionary eye</a></p>
<p>Flatfish might appear to possess one of the more unique evolutionary adaptations, an extreme cranial asymmetry resulting in both eyes being on one side of their head. Yet some recent phylogenetic studies had suggested that this adaptation evolved independently in two groups of flatfish, although other studies supported the traditional view that the cranial asymmetry evolved only once in an ancestor shared by all modern flatfish.</p>
<p>This confusion mainly results from uncertainties in the evolutionary relationships of the wider fish group flatfish belong to, the caringimorpharia. A team of researchers led by Matt Friedman at Oxford University used ultra-conserved DNA elements to produce the most robust phylogeny of the caringimorpharia yet assembled.</p>
<p>This new evolutionary tree supports a single evolutionary origin of the (indeed unique) flatfish cranial asymmetry. It also suggests that the reason for the conflicting results of previous studies was the remarkably quick speed at which this adaptation evolved; just 2.9 million years. Flatfish seem to be remarkable not just for their unique morphology but also for having undergone such drastic morphological changes in nothing more than the blink of an evolutionary eye.</p>
<p>We discussed this research in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/10/24/flatfish-arose-blink-evolutionary-eye/">on our blog</a> in October.</p>
<p><strong>The cryptic Japanese tree frog</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0814-x">Phylogeography reveals an ancient cryptic radiation in East-Asian tree frogs (<em>Hyla japonica</em> group) and complex relationships between continental and inland lineages</a></p>
<p>Is the Japanese tree frog actually Japanese? The frog, going under the scientific name <em>Hyla japonica</em>, is certainly found in Japan, but also in other parts of East Asia like Russia, China, and South Korea. Recently however, some have suggested that <em>H. japonica</em> populations in mainland Asia and in Japan should be considered as two or more separate species.<img alt="hyla-japonica" class="alignright wp-image-8311 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Hyla-japonica-184x300.jpg" title="Public Domain" width="184" /></p>
<p>A multi-national team of researchers, including collaborators from Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, South Korea and China, pooled genetic data on <em>H. japonica </em>and related species from across the East-Asian peninsula. This allowed them to determine both the genetic similarities among these disparate populations and to infer how the evolution and distribution of these frogs was affected by past climatic changes and major geological events.</p>
<p>They found that current patterns of diversity were likely triggered by tectonic activities during the Miocene (5-23 million years ago) and by more recent glacial periods, which caused the formation and disappearance of land-bridges between Japan and the main Asian continent. They also found evidence for cryptic speciation within <em>H. japonica</em>, with significant enough genetic diversity between Japanese and mainland populations for the authors to argue they should indeed be considered separate species.</p>
<p>Curiously, due to the arcane rules of taxonomy, if <em>Hyla japonica</em> were to be split into multiple species the name <em>japonica</em> – literally meaning ‘things related to Japan’ – might have to be assigned to the mainland frog population. So the Japanese tree frog might end up not being Japanese after all.</p>

            <img alt="Retail food stores and supermarkets are important environmental settings for promoting healthy food choices." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/supermarket-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>One of the most recurrent New Year’s resolutions is to lose weight. Nevertheless, year after year only very few of us achieve this noble objective despite our good intentions. As a result, obesity and overweight have not been declining. Clearly, this is a complicated subject and many factors can be attributed to why it is not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain it. Earlier, it has been highlighted how obesogenic environments coupled with our human/psychological flaws undermine our plans to maintain a healthy body weight. In a recent <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3985-x">systematic review</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health,</em> we considered one important environmental factor that plays a major role in calories consumed: the food store. We surveyed and then evaluated health interventions aiming to promote healthy food purchase behavior at food stores and among targeted populations. We assessed not only the effectiveness of various strategies, but we also put the methodological quality of the addressed studies to test. Following is a summary of the main findings from our review.</p>
<p><strong>What characterizes effective food store health interventions?</strong></p>
<p>The general finding of our review is the efficacy of in-store/point-of-purchase healthy food interventions, despite some articles with low methodological quality. Furthermore, the effectiveness of food store health interventions depends on several factors including the type and number of intervention components, employed incentive structure for participating store owners as well as targeted population of consumers, stakeholder involvement and approval, community/consumer engagement, and depth of intervention implementation.</p>
<p>Interventions with multiple strategies are to be preferred as they complement each other. In addition, we found that price incentives receive the strongest response in terms of outcome. This holds true for direct price discounts, vouchers for healthy foods, and subsidies of certain nutritious foods. Incentives work not only for consumers, but also for participating food stores. Example of successful incentives for food stores include the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program in the United States, which incentivizes eligible stores to stock certain promoted healthy foods, and a national discount program in South Africa (Vitality HealthyFood program) that targets households who are members of an insurance company and offers them a discount of up to 25% on healthier foods at more than 800 supermarkets throughout the country. Due to their large scale, both these programs create incentives for supermarkets as well as targeted consumer groups to show pro-health behavior. It should be noted that stores could also be brought on board by incentives other than monetary. Some stores may be interested in building their reputation and as such they can be convinced to promote pro-health food stocking strategies as part of their corporate social responsibility.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8363" style="width: 250px;"><img alt="With obesity on the rise, it's important that grocery stores play a role in reversing the epidemic." class="size-full wp-image-8363" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/obesity.jpg" width="240" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">With obesity on the rise, it’s important that grocery stores play a role in reversing the epidemic.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: Sandra Cohen Rose and Colin Rose</div></figure>
<p>Moreover, engaging consumers and creating an interactive environment for them, in addition to posters and shelf labels, seems to be more helpful than mere labels or nutrition information. Examples of successful consumer engagement include cooking demonstrations/taste tests, and interactive education.</p>
<p><strong>What could be improved in the future?</strong></p>
<p>With regards to research quality, we found that, according to the chosen assessment tool, the methodological quality scores of the papers range from the lowest score of 42.9% to the highest score of 92.9%, yielding an average quality score for all papers of 65.0%. A major takeaway from this result is the need for more high quality studies. Unlike other settings, such as studies reporting school-based interventions, the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is limited for food store settings, albeit with encouraging progress recently. Therefore, more high quality studies in the form of RCTs are called for.</p>
<p>Although price interventions have the strongest impact on the outcome of healthful food purchase, we note, however, important observations. It is not trivial to implement price incentives on a large scale and for sustained periods. Therefore, it needs more persuasion than other interventions (such as information campaigns) as someone has to bear costs associated with subsidizing healthier foods (or higher prices for less healthier foods). The difficulty is even more pronounced if their implementation is not cost-neutral, as someone has to finance the difference due to changes in the original prices. In certain cases, storeowners may be convinced that, due to economies of scale, they will not incur losses despite price reductions of healthier foods. In most cases sustained price interventions need political solutions, and as such research should be disseminated in a way that motivates political action.</p>
<p>A related observation when conducting this review is the limited number of studies that use the currently influential concept of nudging which is believed to be a low-cost alternative to other intervention approaches. For example, few studies demonstrate the effect of using shelf space management to promote healthy foods in prime in-store locations. It is particularly interesting as some prime locations like the checkout area are currently used for promoting high calorie foods. Therefore, more experiments with nudging and other innovative intervention methods in grocery settings are needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more focus should be given to both healthy and unhealthy foods and substitution behavior. The majority of current interventions focus on F&amp;V as the promoted healthy food. While these interventions are rightly justified as most people in many countries do not meet F&amp;V dietary guidelines, there is also a need to consider interventions to limit the consumption of less healthy foods, e.g. high energy items such as sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) and salty snacks. If possible, total food store sales should be used to judge the overall effect of the intervention (including substitution effects). Although differences in studies are unavoidable and understandable, adopting some common outcome measures would be useful to enhance comparability of studies. Moreover, food frequency questionnaires used in some studies, if possible, should be supplemented with objective sales data.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings also highlight the challenges involved with in-store healthy food interventions. We cannot stress enough the importance of stakeholder management and the use of correct incentives for these agents, particularly the food stores whose support is critical for any effort in this direction.

<p>When we feel ostracised, we’re more likely to behave aggressively. Previous research suggests that vengeance on those who we think have wronged us <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/13/what-makes-revenge-sweet/">can be driven by a sense of justice</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/02/03/brain-scans-reveal-revenge-is-sweet-for-men-but-not-women/">may activate neural reward centres</a>. But being ostracised can also lead to generalised aggression, even lashing out at unrelated people, so there seems to be more going on. In new research in <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, David Chester and C. Nathan DeWall tested the idea that social rejection, by making us feel wounded and unwanted, triggers a need to repair our mood by whatever means available, including through the satisfaction of causing harm to those who have made us suffer. They found that aggression can indeed be a viable method of mood repair.</p>
<p><span id="more-16568"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked 156 participants to write an essay on a personal topic, then to swap their essays with other participants to receive feedback on what they’d written. One group of participants received nasty feedback (actually composed by the researchers): “one of the worst essays I have EVER read”. Chester and DeWall measured mood before and after participants were given the chance to express a symbolic form of aggression: sticking pins in a virtual voodoo doll imagined as the person who had given them mean feedback. This act of (un)sympathetic magic did indeed repair mood for the rejected participants, to the point where their mood was indistinguishable from participants who’d received nice feedback.</p>
<p>But just because revenge can boost our mood doesn’t mean that we behave aggressively because we’re seeking that better mood. To investigate motives, the researchers next invited 154 participants to the lab and gave each a pill, telling them it would enhance their thinking for the tests to come. Some of the participants were further told that the pill had a peculiar side-effect: once it kicked in, their mood would become fixed and unchanging (all these claims about the pill were a fiction, it was an inert placebo).</p>
<p>Next, all the participants took part in a computer-based game where they and two other players passed a ball back and forth. Those in the “Rejection condition” experienced a cold shoulder from their two playmates (actually pre-programmed computer responses), receiving only three of the 30 passes, compared to an equal share of passes in the “Accepted condition”.</p>
<p>After the game, participants rated how rejected they felt, then they had the chance to take revenge in a second game against one of their previous playmates. The game was a simple ‘first to the buzzer’ reaction race, but each round the slower player was always punished by a blast of noise through their headphones. When participants were faster, they could adjust the intensity of the noise suffered by their opponent, up to 105 decibels: the volume of a jackhammer or a helicopter hovering at 100 feet.</p>
<p>Most of the time, participants who’d suffered earlier rejection chose to inflict louder sound blasts on their opponent (who’d rejected them earlier). But this wasn’t true of the participants who’d earlier been told that the pill had the side-effect of fixing their mood. In the break between games, these participants were alerted that the drug was by now fully active and their mood would stay as it was for an hour. These participants restricted their sound blasts to the lower levels administered by participants who hadn’t suffered earlier rejection. It wasn’t that the “fixed mood” participants were unaffected by their snubbing: their ratings of rejection were just as high as the other rejected participants. But thanks to the pill, they presumably believed they had no prospect of improving mood, so there would be no point in lashing out.</p>
<p>The results suggest that even seemingly pointless aggression can have a purpose and deliver a desired outcome. Although this research focused on rejection-inspired aggression, it could explain other situations where aggression appears to us to be a plausible route to alleviating our bad mood. Chester and DeWall speculated that “to obtain the positive affect associated with retaliatory aggression, individuals may actively seek out provocation in their daily lives” and they suggested that we consider better alternatives: reflection, meditation and the like. The relief that anger provides is a wretched consolation, and it’s a habit worth kicking.</p>

            <img alt="Spines" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Spines-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Long-term exposure to environmental pollutants is worldwide acknowledged as a major risk factor for health diseases. Indeed, pollution has become a plague. Many clinical studies have focused on the impact of pollution on vital organs such as the lungs and heart. Strong positive correlations between pollutants and cancer (just to make an unfortunate example) are not mysteries anymore. However, new results provide strong evidence that nanoparticles, which can easily find their way into the central nervous system, may lead to severe brain problems. In fact, chronic exposure to harmful metal nanoparticles such as lead, cadmium or iron may impact the normal functioning of our nervous system, eventually leading to cognitive decline as well as to neurodevelopmental dysfunctions.</p>
<p>Lead (Pb) is a well-established environmental pollutant and, because of its high affinity to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Pb can modify basic cellular properties such as cell communication, neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity. Importantly, alteration of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be detrimental for learning and memory processes.</p>
<p>In a recent article published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167401">PLOS ONE</a>, Yang and colleagues report that beta-asarone, a natural compound found in Chinese herbal formulas, such as <em>Kai-Xin-San</em> and <em>Chong-Myung-Tang</em>, was able to ameliorate behavioral and cellular alterations observed in Pb-induced cognitive dysfunctions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>beta-asarone reverses Pb-induced structural and behavioral alterations.</strong></p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnana.2016.00038/full">Golgi-Cox staining technique</a>, the authors report that Pb exposure significantly decreased spine density in the hippocampus, a brain region highly involved in learning and memory functions. Surprisingly, this detrimental effect induced by lead was significantly reduced when rats were treated with beta-asarone. “<em>This result indicated that beta-asarone treatments repaired Pb-induced impairments in spine formation in developmental hippocampus</em>”, says Qian-Qian Yang, the leading author of the study. Dendritic spines arise as small protrusions from the dendritic shaft of various types of neurons and receive inputs from excitatory axons. They contain neurotransmitter receptors, organelles, and signaling systems essential for synaptic function and plasticity.</p>
<p>In order to correlate the results obtained on dendritic synaptogenesis with a possible behavioral phenotype, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task">Morris Water-Maze test</a> was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory in rats. Interestingly, Pb-exposed rats showed a dramatic reduction of spatial memory functions, while beta-asarone treatment was able to retrieve the Pb-induced spatial memory deficits in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether these data suggest that beta-asarone may act as a neuroprotective agent. How that might happen?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>beta-asarone reverses Pb-induced molecular modifications.</strong></p>
<p>Several proteins are involved in the regulation of dendritic spines structure and formation, such as Arc/Arg3.1 and Wnt7a. In addition, such factors are closely related to the activation of the glutamate receptors NMDA-R and AMPA-R. The authors observed that NR2B (a specific subunit of the NMDA receptor) was reduced after Pb exposure in the rat hippocampus, while beta-asarone supplement restored the reduction in a dose-dependent manner. Parallel to that, also the levels of the immediate-early gene Arc/Arg3.1 were found to be restored following beta-asarone treatment. It must be noted that Arc/Arg3.1 is a key molecule to maintain efficient and intact synaptic plasticity, a form of cellular learning.</p>
<p>Another signaling pathway involved in synaptogenesis is the Wnt signaling cascade. This pathway is one of the central morphogenic signaling pathways regulating early neuronal development and Wnt7a preferentially stimulates excitatory dendritic spine formation. “<em>In the present study</em>”, says Dr. Chen, the senior author of the study, “<em>the relative expression of Wnt7a in hippocampal CA1 area of Pb-exposed rats significantly decreased by 43.2%, which is consistent with our previous results, while beta-asarone treatment dose-dependently recovered the decreasing</em>”.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, beta-asarone has been also reported to reverse decreased BDNF and promote hippocampal neurogenesis in chronic unpredictable mild stress exposed rats (Dong H et al., 2014) and to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a critical kinase involved in neurogenesis (Mao J et al., 2015). “<em>These reports together with our results suggest BDNF/Wnt signaling pathway might represent a key target for various neurogenesis agents, including beta-asarone</em>”, concludes Qian-Qian Yang.</p>
<p>Although the study tries to dig into the intimate cellular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective action of beta-asarone, the authors were not able to point to a direct mechanism by which this natural compound may be the key actor for the structural and behavioral effects observed. In agreement with this last point, the authors state that “<em>Although the exact molecular targets of beta-asarone in promoting neurogenesis are still unclear, our study provided preliminary hints for their underlying mechanisms</em>”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>In a world where environmental pollution has become a serious and dramatic health problem, investing in basic research may lead to the discovery of natural agents able to reduce pollutants’ side effects. Obviously, such pharmacological strategies will be completely useless and unfortunate if not paralleled by drastic changes in environmental regulation and policy.<br />

<p>Providing patients with choice regarding the health care they receive is actively encouraged in healthcare systems worldwide. For many patients the choice within mental health care is perceived as being limited to pharmacological versus psychological treatment, but this is certainly not the case. Providers of psychological therapies are encouraged to offer patients choice about their treatment. But does a patient’s preference for how their treatment is delivered, and whether these preferences are met, affect the outcome of the treatment?</p>
<img class="wp-image-8337 size-medium alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Which-way-Sarah-Joy-Flickr-300x200.jpg" title="Sarah Joy, Flickr CC" width="300" />
<p>A study <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-015-0702-8">published</a> in January by <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.crawford">Mike Crawford</a> and colleagues, analyzed data from the <a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsychiatry/quality/nationalclinicalaudits/psychologicaltherapies/psychologicaltherapies.aspx">National Audit of Psychological Therapies for Anxiety and Depression</a> (NAPT), a large scale examination of the practice of psychological therapies in England and Wales which was carried out between July 2012 and January 2013. 14,587 respondents who were receiving psychological therapies in 184 NHS services were asked about their treatment preferences and the extent to which these were met by their service. They were asked about five aspects of their treatment: venue, time of day, gender of therapist, language that the treatment was delivered in, and therapy type. They were also asked to rate the extent to which they felt the therapy helped them cope with their difficulties.</p>
<p>The researchers found that 86% of patients expressed a preference for at least one aspect of their therapy. Out of these, almost 37% indicated that they had not been offered adequate choice, i.e. their preference had not been met. Those who had preferences for how, when and where their psychological treatment was delivered that were not met, were less likely to report that they were helped by it, suggesting that routinely assessing and meeting patient preferences may improve the outcomes of psychological treatment.</p>

<p>A wealth of evidence indicates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) populations manifest inequalities in both physical and mental health. Previous work has indicated increased risk of mental disorder symptoms, suicide and substance misuse in those that identify themselves as non-heterosexual. Despite this, sexual orientation was not recorded routinely in many population health surveys until recently.</p>
<p><img alt="rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies" class="alignleft wp-image-8339 size-medium" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies-300x199.jpg" title="Wikipedia" width="300" />In March, <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/medicine/people/profile/j-semlyen">Joanna Semlyen</a> and colleagues <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z">published</a> research investigating the association between sexual orientation identity and poor mental health and wellbeing among adults in the UK. They used data from 12 population health surveys in the UK and conducted an individual participant meta-analysis. The data are based on a combination of home visits and telephone interviews, self-completed questionnaires and web surveys. Out of 94,818 participants, 1.1% identified as lesbian/gay; 0.9% as bisexual; and 0.8% as ‘other’.</p>
<p>The researchers found that adults who identify as LGB in the UK are twice as likely as heterosexual adults to suffer from anxiety or depression, although the association was different in different age groups. Adults under the age of 35 and, especially, those aged 55 and over are more vulnerable to poor mental health. Whilst the study reports an association between LGB identity and symptoms of poor mental health, it did not examine causes of these health disparities.</p>

<p>An Intellectual disability is a disability which originates before the age of 18 and is characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, interfering with everyday social and practical skills. Research suggests that people with an intellectual disability are disproportionately involved in crime both as perpetrators and victims, however due to limitations with these studies the available evidence remains far from definitive.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/t/thomas-professor-stuartdm">Stuart Thomas</a> and colleagues <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0869-7">published</a> a study in which they sought to determine the prevalence of criminal victimization and offending in a population with intellectual disability. The researchers employed a case linkage design using data from three databases (from disability services, public mental health services and police records) in order to analyze rates of offending and victimization in the state of Victoria, Australia; 2600 participants with an intellectual disability were compared to a community comparison group which included 4830 individuals.</p>
<p>The results indicated that, overall, people with intellectual disability were less likely to have an official history of victimization and were no more or less likely to have a history of criminal offending than people without intellectual disability. When the data were analyzed according to the crime level, the intellectual disability group was twice as likely to have experience violent victimization and almost six times as likely to have experienced sexual victimization, compared to the community group<em>; </em>they were almost more likely to have violently or sexually offended than the community group. Those with intellectual disability and a co-morbid mental illness had the highest rates of victimization and offending.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that statistically speaking, people with intellectual disability are at greater risk of experiencing violent and sexual victimization and more likely to violently and sexually offend than people living in the community.</p>

<p>Nonmedical prescription drug use typically refers to the taking of prescription drugs, whether obtained by prescription or otherwise, in a manner not intended by the prescriber or by a person for whom the drug was not prescribed; this includes the use of prescription medication to achieve euphoric states. Nonmedical prescription drug use is a major public health concern in the US, but data regarding its prevalence outside the US is limited.</p>
<p>In a study <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0909-3">published</a> in August, <a href="https://www.rti.org/expert/scott-novak">Scott Novak</a> and colleagues investigated nonmedical prescription drug use in five European countries – Denmark, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The researchers analyzed data from 2,032 youths and 20,035 adults collected as part of the European Union Medicine Study, a series of parallel nationally representative surveys conducted in the five countries. Self-reported information included details on whether respondents had ever used prescription medication for euphoria or to self-treat a medical condition with medication that was not prescribed for them.</p>

<p>Examining three different classes of subscription drug – opioids, sedatives and stimulants – the researchers found that out of the five countries examined, Germany had the lowest levels of nonmedical prescription drug use, while the UK, Spain and Sweden had the highest levels. Having received a prescription for the particular outcome drug was associated with an elevated risk of nonmedical use. For example, receiving a prescription for a pain reliever was associated with an eight times higher risk of subsequent nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers; the risk was ten times higher for sedatives and seven times higher for stimulants. The most common sources of prescription drugs for nonmedical use were family and friends – 44% for opioids and 62% for sedatives; Internet purchases were the least common source of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>The researcher suggest that international collaborations are needed for continued monitoring and intervention efforts to target population subgroups at greatest risk for nonmedical prescription drug use.</p>

<p>For those suffering from a long-term mental health condition the ability to manage and engage with everyday life is a key concern. Having a support network in place is often seen as key for self-management of a mental health condition. Many people consider their pets as being as important as family members, but can the companionship of a pet help with the management of a mental health condition?</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Helen.Brooks.html">Helen Brooks</a> and colleagues <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1111-3">published</a> their study examining the role that pets play in the management of mental health conditions; the article was a huge hit with both our readers and the public! The researchers interviewed 54 participants, 25 of whom had a pet, who were under the care of community-based mental health services and had been diagnosed with a severe mental illness. Participants were asked to rate the importance of members of their personal network including friends, family, health professionals, pets, hobbies, places, activities and objects, by placing them in a diagram of three concentric circles. Anything placed in the central circle was considered most important; the middle circle was of secondary importance and the outer circle was for those considered of lesser importance.</p>

<p>Pets played an important role in the social networks of people managing a long-term mental health problem, as 60% placed their pet in the central most important circle and 20% placed their pet in the second circle. Participants indicated that their pets contributed to the management of their condition in a number of ways; from developing routines that provided emotional and social support, to distraction from distressing symptoms and providing acceptance without judgment, to name but a few.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>I wish I could make the world a better place. I would like to prevent climate change and wars; but that’s not so easy on a personal level. What I can try to do more modestly as a scientist, is to make the scientific world a better place. We have all heard the phrase “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">publish or perish</a>”. We all complain that careers are made by publishing in “high-impact” journals who favor story-telling and grand claims, and generally select papers arbitrarily (let alone that <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/you-are-not-a-good-scientist-if-you-use-impact-factors-for-evaluating-research/">they do not even predict the impact of papers they publish</a>); a trend that has been increasingly strong and has very negative impact on how research is done, including <a href="http://blog.pubpeer.com/?p=164">serious ethical problems</a>. But what do we do concretely about it? For most of us including myself, not much. We keep on submitting to those journals, and we say we have no choice because that is how we are evaluated (for positions or grants). But who evaluates us? Surely there are some political aspects to it (mostly for funding), but the truth is, we are evaluated by peers. In brief, we are inflicting this madness on ourselves.</p>
<p>So: let us stop complaining and try to change the situation. I have previously exposed a vision of <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-vision-of-the-post-journal-world/">how the academic publishing system could look like without journals</a> (by the way, this is not an original thought, fortunately). How to make it happen?</p>
<h1>Where we are now</h1>
<p>We should be hopeful, because many good things are happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preprint servers are getting more and more attention. In biology, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript">a number of journals are now accepting direct submissions from biorxiv</a>, including all the PLoS journals, PNAS, eLife, the Journal of Neuroscience. This ought to boost submissions of preprints.</li>
<li>A few journals have started publishing the reviews along with the accepted paper, for example <a href="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</a>, <a href="http://eneuro.org/">eNeuro</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13626">Nature Communications</a>.</li>
<li>More generally, open access to both paper and <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">data</a> is getting more and more common and enforced.</li>
<li>A new journal, <a href="https://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a>, now practices post-publication review. The paper is indexed in pubmed once two reviewers have approved it.</li>
<li>Very significantly, the Wellcome Trust has opened a journal for its grantees, <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/">Wellcome Open Research</a>, based on post-publication review (in partnership with F1000), with this statement “The expectation is that this, and other similar funder platforms that are expected to emerge, will ultimately combine into one central platform that ensures that assessment can only be done at the article level”.</li>
<li>Finally: <a href="https://pubpeer.com/">Pubpeer</a>, started just a few years ago. A simple idea: to let anyone comment on any paper, anonymously or not, and let the authors know and respond. You should install their browser plugin. This is an individual initiative but it has already made a big impact, in particular by showing that the “big journals” are not better than the other ones in preventing flaws or frauds. It also addresses the concern that open reviews would be too nice: anyone who finds serious flaws can spot them anonymously and the authors will have to consider them. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/">Pubmed commons</a> is similar, but with signed comments.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What we can do now on a personal level</h1>
<ol>
<li>Put every single paper you write on a “preprint” server before you submit to a journal.</li>
<li>Put all your data online, see eg <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a>.</li>
<li>Remove journal names from the publications in your website. People who care about them will find out anyway.</li>
<li>Start a literature search routine that does not involve looking at tables of contents; a few ideas in this <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/814380242580082688">Twitter thread</a>; you could also have an author alert on Google Scholar.</li>
<li>Write comments on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/">Pubpeer</a>; including on “pre-prints”.</li>
<li>Send your papers to a journal with open post-publication review. I know this one is difficult, because the community still cares about impact factors. But at least you can favor those with public reviews (eg eLife, Nature Communications; I would prefer the former as it is non-profit). Instead of sending your papers to Frontiers, send them to F1000 Research; or at least eNeuro.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the local community level, we can advocate for post-publication review. For example, the INCF has opened a channel on F1000 Research. Maybe we could have a computational neuroscience channel there, sponsored by the OCNS. It is too bad that F1000 Research is for-profit rather than institutional, but currently I do not know of other options.</p>
<h1>What we can do on a more global scale</h1>
<p>Open post-publication review potentially addresses the issue of recognition, but it does not address the issue of visibility. One concern I have by submitting in F1000 Research (for example), is that my intended readership will not know about it. There are so many papers published each year, one does not even have the time to read the title of all of them. This is one role journals have fulfilled: to select papers worthy of interest for a given community. But since we do not need journals anymore to publish anything, editorial selection and publication need not be coupled anymore. So here is my proposition. We make an independent website which lets any scientist, or possibly any group of scientists, be their own journal. That is, make a selection of papers they find interesting (including preprints). We provide a number of tools to make this as simple as possible: linking to pubpeer and pubmed commons, searching/browsing, alerting authors whose work is selected, email alerts and RSS feeds, etc. Papers are preferentially linked to the preprint if it exists, so as to completely bypass the journals. We could also let authors suggest their own paper for editorial selection. Basically, we provide all the services a journal typically has. This will be made increasingly easier as public open reviews become more widespread. These new “journals” could be run by an individual scientist, or a lab (eg linked to a journal club), or possibly a scientific society or group of scientists. Let us call any of these an “editor”. I would be happy for example to follow the selections of a few authors I respect, and that would be probably more valuable to me that the selection made by any journal, of which very few typically catch my attention in a given table of contents.</p>
<p>I am hoping that it goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>People start using these individual journals, because it provides relevant information to them.</li>
<li>As a result, papers in less well-known journals and preprints start getting more attention, and more citations.</li>
<li>People take the habit of putting their papers on preprint servers because they get immediate attention.</li>
<li>Editors progressively stop selecting papers published in journals because they have already selected them when they were preprints.</li>
<li>As editors are also committee members, journal names start to matter less in evaluating research.</li>
<li>Traditional journals disappear; instead, we have direct publication (formerly known as preprints) + open public reviews, both anonymous and signed.</li>
</ol>
<h1>How to get it started?</h1>
<p>One simple idea to get it started is to make automatic channels for the actual conventional journals. For each journal, we list the table of contents, linked to preprint versions instead of the journal website, and to pubpeer, etc. If it’s convenient, people might start to use it, especially if it allows free access to the papers (legally, since we would use preprints). Then to get people to use the non-conventional channels, we provide suggestions based on content similarity (ie “you may also like...”).</p>
<p>How about this resolution?</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.lauraspinney.com/">Laura Spinney</a></p>
<p>Glastonbury 1997, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the pilgrimage to Lourdes in 2008: what do they have in common? All three were the backdrop to <a href="http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)30994-8/abstract">outbreaks of communicable disease</a>, and so of interest to doctors working in mass gathering medicine. The goal of this relatively young field is to address the specific health problems associated with mass events, but two British psychologists now claim that this can only be done effectively by understanding the psychological transformation that people undergo when they join a crowd.</p>
<p><span id="more-16517"></span></p>
<p>Joining a crowd changes a person’s behaviour, say Nick Hopkins of Dundee University and Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews, and that change can have both a positive and a negative impact on her health and on the health of those around her. To enhance the former and reduce the latter, they argue, you need to understand both the nature of those changes and the reasons why they happen.</p>
<p>Their argument doesn’t apply to all crowds. It’s not true of the morning scrum on the underground, for example: a physical crowd that happens more by chance or necessity than by design. But it does apply to what they call a “psychological crowd”: that is, people who come together for a specific purpose, such as to listen to rock or to perform a religious ritual, and who in doing so give up their individual identity to adopt the identity of the group, along with its norms and values.</p>
<p>In a study of one of the largest gatherings on earth, the Mela – at which millions of Hindus come together to bathe in the River Ganges in Uttar Pradesh, India – Hopkins, Reicher and colleagues, including Shruti Tewari, detected clear health benefits of the communal experience. Pilgrims self-reported a <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/02/kumbh-mela/spinney-text">10 per cent improvement in their sense of wellbeing</a>, for example, an effect <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23082155">similar to that of some powerful anti-depressant drugs</a>. Those attending such events also described feelings of intense pleasure at being surrounded by others who shared their goals and outlook.</p>
<p>Shared identity may also account for the “<a href="http://www.bps.org.uk/impact/recognising-and-understanding-collective-resilience-crowds-survivors">collective resilience</a>” that has been observed in the wake of natural disasters, when survivors reach out to help one another because – in these psychologists’ view – they have redefined themselves as survivors of that disaster.</p>
<p>But the same feelings of togetherness that inspire collective resilience can also have harmful consequences, for example exposing people to situations they would normally avoid, and that pose a genuine risk to their health. While writing my upcoming book about the Spanish flu of 1918-1920 (<em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pale-Rider-Spanish-Changed-World/dp/1910702374/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1483525108&amp;sr=8-1">Pale Rider</a></em>, to be published by Jonathan Cape on 1 June 2017), I came across plenty of anecdotal evidence for collective resilience during the pandemic. In one German town, for example, young women volunteered to nurse strangers in their homes with such enthusiasm that doctors complained they were becoming a nuisance. Such mutual helping behaviour may have been counter-productive in that context because it encouraged the spread of a highly infectious disease.</p>
<p>Normally, disgust would deter us from approaching a coughing, sneezing stranger, but a sense of shared identity can weaken this basic protective mechanism. In 2006, for example, Australian researchers <a href="http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(06)00019-5/abstract">demonstrated</a> the truth of one piece of folk wisdom: that parents find their own children’s nappies less disgusting than those of other children. This was true even when the mothers didn’t know which nappies belonged to which child, meaning that our experience of disgust can be influenced by basic biological relatedness. Earlier this year, Reicher and colleagues expanded on that idea when they <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/10/2631">showed</a> that the feelings of disgust elicited by a sweaty t-shirt were weaker if people thought the t-shirt belonged to a member of their social group, rather than to someone outside it. They were more tolerant of the disgusting object, in other words, if they believed they shared an identity with its owner.</p>
<p>Translating that finding to the real world, it could help explain why the same survey that identified the disease outbreaks at Lourdes, Glastonbury and Salt Lake City, also counted 15 outbreaks of gastrointestinal infections at mass gatherings from the late 1980s to the present day that were associated – in every case – with non-compliance with hygiene rules. When the gathering in question is on a very large scale, such outbreaks can have serious and long-term consequences. In 1817, for example, there was an outbreak of cholera at the gigantic Kumbh Mela – a sort of mega Mela held roughly every three years – and homeward-bound pilgrims carried the infection throughout East Asia and into Europe, triggering the Asiatic cholera pandemic that raged until 1824.</p>
<p>Harnessing these psychological processes to improve health outcomes at mass gatherings might start with something as simple as an information campaign to remind people about the basic rules of hygiene. In time, perhaps, medics and psychologists could devise more sophisticated ways of enhancing the positive effects of crowds, while reducing their negative ones. It’s early days for such a collaboration, but Hopkins and Reicher believe that the two parties ignore each other at their peril.</p>

            <p>Despite the global prevalence of gastric disease, there are few adequate models in which to study the fundus epithelium of the human stomach. We differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into gastric organoids containing fundic epithelium by first identifying and then recapitulating key events in embryonic fundus development. We found that disruption of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in mouse embryos led to conversion of fundic to antral epithelium, and that β-catenin activation in hPSC-derived foregut progenitors promoted the development of human fundic-type gastric organoids (hFGOs). We then used hFGOs to identify temporally distinct roles for multiple signalling pathways in epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation of fundic cell types, including chief cells and functional parietal cells. hFGOs are a powerful model for studying the development of the human fundus and the molecular bases of human gastric physiology and pathophysiology, and also represent a new platform for drug discovery.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21021">doi: 10.1038/nature21021</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Q4DrdogBGmM" width="1" />

 Aggregation of amyloid-β peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. Recent experiments suggest that variations in amyloid-β fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in Alzheimer’s disease phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with different clinical and pathological phenotypes. Here we investigate correlations between structural variation and Alzheimer’s disease phenotype using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of Alzheimer’s disease brain cortex. We compared two atypical Alzheimer’s disease clinical subtypes—the rapidly progressive form (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD)—with a typical prolonged-duration form (t-AD). On the basis of ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from patients with t-AD and PCA-AD, whereas Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures and indicate that there is a qualitative difference between Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

 Chimaeroid fishes (Holocephali) are one of the four principal divisions of modern gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Despite only 47 described living species, chimaeroids are the focus of resurgent interest as potential archives of genomic data and for the unique perspective they provide on chondrichthyan and gnathostome ancestral conditions. Chimaeroids are also noteworthy for their highly derived body plan. However, like other living groups with distinctive anatomies, fossils have been of limited use in unravelling their evolutionary origin, as the earliest recognized examples already exhibit many of the specializations present in modern forms. Here we report the results of a computed tomography analysis of Dwykaselachus, an enigmatic chondrichthyan braincase from the ~280 million year old Karoo sediments of South Africa. Externally, the braincase is that of a symmoriid shark and is by far the most complete uncrushed example yet discovered. Internally, the morphology exhibits otherwise characteristically chimaeroid specializations, including the otic labyrinth arrangement and the brain space configuration relative to exceptionally large orbits. These results have important implications for our view of modern chondrichthyan origins, add robust structure to the phylogeny of early crown group gnathostomes, reveal preconditions that suggest an initial morpho-functional basis for the derived chimaeroid cranium, and shed new light on the chondrichthyan response to the extinction at the end of the Devonian period.

 Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed frequent genomic amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2, VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity. However, some molecular features, including DNA hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. These data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of these tumours and a foundation for new therapies.

            <p>Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. This multi-stage process requires tumour cells to survive in the circulation, extravasate at distant sites, then proliferate; it involves contributions from both the tumour cell and tumour microenvironment (‘host’, which includes stromal cells and the immune system). Studies suggest the early steps of the metastatic process are relatively efficient, with the post-extravasation regulation of tumour growth (‘colonization’) being critical in determining metastatic outcome. Here we show the results of screening 810 mutant mouse lines using an in vivo assay to identify microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization. We identify 23 genes that, when disrupted in mouse, modify the ability of tumour cells to establish metastatic foci, with 19 of these genes not previously demonstrated to play a role in host control of metastasis. The largest reduction in pulmonary metastasis was observed in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster homologue 2 (Spns2)-deficient mice. We demonstrate a novel outcome of S1P-mediated regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, whereby deletion of Spns2, either globally or in a lymphatic endothelial-specific manner, creates a circulating lymphopenia and a higher percentage of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells present in the lung. This allows for potent tumour cell killing, and an overall decreased metastatic burden.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20792">doi: 10.1038/nature20792</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/-089vIIBbAY" width="1" />

 Hydrogen spillover is the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a metal catalyst particle, on which they are generated, onto the catalyst support. The phenomenon has been much studied and its occurrence on reducible supports such as titanium oxide is established, yet questions remain about whether hydrogen spillover can take place on nonreducible supports such as aluminium oxide. Here we use the enhanced precision of top-down nanofabrication to prepare controlled and precisely tunable model systems that allow us to quantify the efficiency and spatial extent of hydrogen spillover on both reducible and nonreducible supports. We place multiple pairs of iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles on titanium oxide and aluminium oxide supports, varying the distance between the pairs from zero to 45 nanometres with a precision of one nanometre. We then observe the extent of the reduction of the iron oxide particles by hydrogen atoms generated on the platinum using single-particle in situ X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy applied simultaneously to all particle pairs. The data, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, reveal fast hydrogen spillover on titanium oxide that reduces remote iron oxide nanoparticles via coupled proton–electron transfer. In contrast, spillover on aluminium oxide is mediated by three-coordinated aluminium centres that also interact with water and that give rise to hydrogen mobility competing with hydrogen desorption; this results in hydrogen spillover about ten orders of magnitude slower than on titanium oxide and restricted to very short distances from the platinum particle. We anticipate that these observations will improve our understanding of hydrogen storage and catalytic reactions involving hydrogen, and that our approach to creating and probing model catalyst systems will provide opportunities for studying the origin of synergistic effects in supported catalysts that combine multiple functionalities.

            The pain of rejection is one that every scientist has felt: but what happens to papers after they're declined by a journal?

In a new study, researchers Earnshaw et al. traced the fate of almost 1,000 manuscripts which had been submitted to and rejected by ear, nose and throat journal Clinical Otolaryngology between 2011 to 2013.





To find out if the rejected papers had eventually appeared elsewhere, Earnshaw et al. searched PubMed and Google Scholar for published papers with titles a

<p>In his keynote, <a href="https://carleton.ca/biology/people/steven-j-cooke/">Steven Cooke</a> from Carleton University (Canada) gave an overview of the current state of conservation physiology and how conservation physiologists contribute to the understanding of mechanisms behind declining species populations to inform policy and management practices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jodierummer.com/">Jodie Rummer</a> from James Cook University (Australia) reviewed the human-induced stressors on coral reefs such as ocean warming, acidification, hypoxia events and altered water quality. Jodie highlighted that whilst fish are adaptable to changes while maintaining oxygen transport and physiological performance, the recent and very rapid habitat changes pose a challenge.</p>
<p>Another very interesting keynote was given by <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/81128-bruford-flsw-mike">Mike Bruford</a> (Cardiff University, UK) who discussed how the additional information gained from ‘omics data’ can be used by conservation management organizations to commission and implement recommendations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en-287042.html">Hans Van Dyck</a> from the Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium) discussed the importance of an organism-centered and resource-based habitat approach for several conservation issues, demonstrating his point using examples of butterfly studies. Hans finished by touching upon ecological traps which arise from rapid environmental changes and cause problems with the life-cycle regulation of organisms.</p>
<p>The final keynote lecture towards the end of Zoology2016 was given by <a href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/sste/staff/profile/index.php?id=2232">John Fa</a> from Manchester Metropolitan University (UK). John’s talk was focused on sustainability as he discussed wild animals as food source (bushmeat) in tropical rainforests worldwide. Bushmeat consumption is an important source of protein in central Africa and there is a need for improved governance to ensure food security for people inhabiting rainforests while protecting endangered species and biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights from the conference</strong></p>
<p>Apart from excellent keynote lectures, Zoology2016 was also a forum for promising young academics to present their work. Talks covered a wide range of topics from molecular phylogenetics, genomics, animal physiology and morphology to behavioral ecology, marine biodiversity and conservation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8347" style="width: 223px;"><img alt="Pubic domain." class=" wp-image-8347" height="320" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Macaca_nigra_self-portrait_rotated_and_cropped.jpg" width="213" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Public domain.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The session on animal behavior covered topics such as parent-offspring communication and social relationships and behavior in captive African wild dogs where a rank reversal was observed after pack separation. The session concluded with two talks on primates about the consolidation behavior in chimpanzees and results on how for macaques, the females are wearing the trousers by being in charge of initiating friendships and sexual engagements.</p>
<p>The final day started with interesting presentations on the functional morphology of animals covering bite force in lizards and extinct lemur species, how the middle ear of birds cope with large and sudden pressure changes, a comparative analysis of warning calls in piranhas and an analysis of the teeth digging technique of mole-rats. A parallel series of talks on ecological physiology was concluded by Jodie Rummer with an interesting presentation on how the epaulette shark responds to changes in its environment such as elevated carbon dioxide levels and ocean warming. Another interesting talk focused on the DNA barcoding of rove beetles and its application in forensics. One of the last presentations of the day was given by <a href="https://www.naturalsciences.be/en/science/do/539/staff/member/1232">Maarten Vanhove</a>, about various interesting and impactful conservation projects in Africa that attracted a lot of attention from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Prize winners</strong></p>
<p>The afternoon of the final day was dedicated to another highlight, the presentations of three prize winners. <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/maurijn-van-der-zee">Maurijn van der Zee</a> from the University of Leiden (Netherlands) won the prize from the Dutch Zoological Society for his work on evolutionary innovation in insect eggs. The serosa, an embryonic tissue of epithelial cells present in most insects, protects the insect egg against desiccation and infection. According to van der Zee, the serosa is one of the reasons that insects are extremely successful in occupying terrestrial habitats.</p>
<p>The Pekwijkstichting prize went to <a href="https://science.naturalis.nl/en/people/scientists/klaas-douwe-dijkstra/">Klaas-Douwe Dijkstra</a> from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (Netherlands) who published a comment earlier this year in Springer Nature’s flagship journal <a href="http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.19870!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/533172a.pdf">Nature</a> about human’s motivation for studying biodiversity and the thirst for discovering new species. His talk very much followed on from that theme by giving an overview of his work on dragonflies, stretching from discovering new taxa and high-impact research to conservation, consultancy and public interest.</p>
<p>The final prize winner was <a href="https://bio.kuleuven.be/pf/functional_biology/staff-1/00112326">Marie-Anne Deprez</a> from KU Leuven (Belgium) who was awarded the Kets prize for her Master thesis on the impact of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) which facilitates neuronal thyroid hormone uptake crucial for brain development in vertebrates. Her results contribute to the understanding of possible mechanisms by which MCT8 deficiency disrupts human corticogenesis.</p>

<li>Scientists do some research and write a paper about it to share their findings with the world.</li>
<li>The paper is submitted to a journal, chosen for its prestige.</li>
<li>The editor, possibly a professional editor (ie not a professional scientist), judges that the paper is not worth of review: go back to (2).</li>
<li>The editor sends the paper to 2-3 reviewers, asking them to review the paper quickly (the more prestigious, the quicker). Reviewers are chosen based on the editor’s expertise and network.</li>
<li>Reviewers have too many reviews to write already: go back to (4).</li>
<li>The reviewers (or one reviewer) find the paper uninteresting, or bad, or they “don’t believe it”: go back to (2).</li>
<li>The reviews are mixed: a third reviewer is asked; go back to (4).</li>
<li>The reviewers find the paper interesting enough but have requests for the authors; they should entirely rewrite their paper; they should do new experiments; they should cite the reviewers; they should remove an uninteresting figure; they should add some discussion points.</li>
<li>After some work, the authors submit a revised paper.</li>
<li>Actually, reviewers didn’t think the paper was that interesting anyway: go back to (2).</li>
<li>The reviewers have more requests: go back to (9).</li>
<li>The paper is accepted: congratulations!</li>
<li>The format of references does not follow the journal’s style: please rewrite the reference list.</li>
<li>The author’s paper now belongs to Elsevier/Springer Nature/etc. It will be sold by the publisher to academic institutions, with a margin of 30-40%.</li>
<li>(recent alternative option) The authors pay publication fees of about $2000. The paper is now freely accessible.</li>
<li>A knowledgeable reader disagrees with the main conclusion of the paper: she writes a letter to the editor.</li>
<li>After careful consideration, the letter is rejected.</li>
<li>Another reader, not an expert of the field, reads the paper in a prestigious journal and believes it is highly regarded in the community, until she talks with colleagues and finds out that the paper is very criticized.</li>
<li>The prestigious paper is commented in mainstream journals. Experts rant about the journalists.</li>
<li>The first author applies for a position. The committee examines CVs of all candidates and selects those with publications in prestigious journals. The senior author sends an excellent letter of recommendation. The committee values it if the senior author is famous.</li>

What I want to do here is not one more critique of this system, but rather give a vision of what the publication system could be and, in my opinion, will be, perhaps within a decade. This is a vision of a publication system centered on individual articles, rather than on journals. It is made possible today by information technology (aka “the internet”). What stands in its way is, in a word: conservatism. It works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scientists do some research and write a paper about it to share their findings with the world.</li>
<li>The paper is uploaded to an archive site, together with the data. All is freely accessible to anyone.</li>
<li>The authors invite an unlimited number of professional scientists (say, authors of at least one paper) to write a formal, signed, review. The reviews are public.</li>
<li>Any other scientist can contribute a signed or anonymous review or comment, including comments on the public reviews (aka “scientific debate”).</li>
<li>Authors respond to the reviews and may submit a revised version.</li>
<li>Authors decide when to stop the revision process; reviewers express their satisfaction, or not.</li>
<li>Any scientist can recommend the paper if she finds it worth reading. Tools are made available to search for papers, possibly using the number of recommendations, possibly weighted by scientist reputation (all data are freely accessible and third parties provide searching tools).</li>
<li>A knowledgeable reader disagrees with the main conclusion of the paper: she writes a public critique, signed or anonymous, after reexamining the paper’s raw data. The authors respond publicly.</li>
<li>Another reader, not an expert of the field, reads the paper. She notices that many knowledgeable scientists disagree with the conclusions and can read the detailed arguments and the authors’ response.</li>
<li>The first author applies for a position. For every publication, the committee reads the reaction of the community (formal reviews, comments, recommendations) and uses it to evaluate the value of the work along all the dimensions addressed in the reactions (importance, originality, technicality, etc). The committee also asks the candidate what her main contributions are in her view and why. The candidate can point to published reactions to her work that support her claims.</li>
<li>The senior author applies for a grant or a promotion. The committee reads the reaction of the community to the candidate’s previous work. They might also look at review invitations and reviewing activity.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">In the post-journal world, a paper is submitted a single time (but of course it can be revised), and in contrast with the journal model, the reaction of the community is known. As a consequence, quality stamps (journal names) are obsolete. No review is thrown away. As a consequence, scientists save time on both submitting and reviewing. Scientists are not incentivized to make grand claims. In addition, the system saves several billions of dollars each year (eg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-11-03/academic-publishing-can-t-remain-such-a-great-business">US libraries spend $2 billion each year on subscriptions</a>), not counting the time saved on wasted reviews and submissions.</p>
<p align="justify">All of this is clearly possible with today’s technology. The next question I will try to address is: how to move quickly to the post-journal world?</p>

            Earlier this year, neuroscience was shaken by the publication in PNAS of Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates. In this paper, Anders Eklund, Thomas E. Nichols and Hans Knutsson reported that commonly used software for analysing fMRI data produces many false-positives.



But now, Boston College neuroscientist Scott D. Slotnick has criticized Eklund et al.'s alarming conclusions in a new piece in Cognitive Neuroscience.

<p>As the dawn breaks on a new year, now might be a good time to think about what you want to get out of life over the longer-term. We already know from past research that having a greater “sense of purpose” is good for us psychologically: it’s linked with experiencing more positive emotions and generally feeling better about life. Now <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616300836?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">a study</a> in the<em> Journal of Research in Personality</em> suggests there are material benefits too. Researchers followed the same sample of people over a period of about nine years, and they found that during that time, those individuals who reported a greater sense of purpose at the study start had accumulated greater wealth. <span id="more-16318"></span></p>
<p>What does it mean to have a sense of purpose? Patrick Hill and his colleagues measured it by asking 7108 US residents to rate their agreement with three statements: “Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them”; “I live life one day at a time and don’t really think about the future”; and “I sometimes feel as if I’ve done all there is to do in life.” Participants were considered to have more sense of purpose if they agreed strongly with the first statement while disagreeing strongly with the last two.</p>
<p>The participants also completed a basic personality questionnaire, rated their life-satisfaction, and then answered questions about their income and accumulated wealth. At the study start, participants with more sense of purpose earned more and had accumulated more wealth, even after factoring out the influence of personality and life-satisfaction, and other personal details like education.</p>
<p>Between seven and ten years later, the researchers managed to re-interview nearly 5000 of the same participants. They found that those individuals who’d reported more sense of purpose at the study start had accumulated more wealth over this time period, and they experienced greater increases to their income. Again, this was true even after controlling for the influence of other factors like personality, life-satisfaction, education and marital status. Statistically speaking, a one standard deviation increase in purpose at the study start was associated with accumulating an extra $20,857 over the ensuing nine years or so of the study.</p>
<p>Breaking the results down by age group, the financial benefits of purpose were stronger among older participants at the study start, but the purpose-related gains over time were greater for younger participants aged 20-35. In fact, for participants older than 35, there were no long-term benefits of purpose through the study, perhaps because they had already been accrued by the study start. These age-related findings suggest that a sense of purpose might have particularly strong financial consequences as people are starting out in their careers.</p>
<p>It’s a shame the researchers didn’t ask the participants about the content of their sense of purpose. For example, is it only job-related or money-related long-term objectives that are likely to aid wealth acquisition, or might similar benefits accrue from any kind of sense of purpose that engenders the pursuit of more constructive daily activities and a focus on the future? Hill and his team speculated a little vaguely that more purpose in life leads to greater wealth because it goes together with a greater capability and propensity to pursue long-term goals. They acknowledged some limitations of their findings, including the fact they relied on self-reports on wealth and income. “These caveats aside,” they concluded, “the current findings provide evidence that even when it comes to finances, finding a purpose in life appears to be well worth it.”</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p align="justify"><b></b>Where to send computational and theoretical neuroscience papers? A list of journals can be found on <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~perlewitz/journals.html">Jim Perlewitz’s page</a>. First, many journals belong to one of the scientific publishing companies who make huge profits from the free work of academics (margins around 30-40%), with questionable added value. In computational neuroscience, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="justify">Journal in Computational Neuroscience (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience; in Neuroinformatics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Biological Cybernetics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Cognitive Neurodynamics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Neuroinformatics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Network: Computation in Neural Systems (Taylor &amp; Francis)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Then we have Neural Computation, run by MIT Press, which is non-profit. Unfortunately, papers are behind paywalls. In my case, the library does not have a subscription.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, there is PLoS Computational Biology, a highly respected journal in the field. However, even in this non-profit journal, open access is very expensive ($2250 per paper). I find these costs hard to justify, when any scientist can publish on archives for free (eg <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv</a> or <a href="http://biorxiv.org/">biorxiv</a>). The solution to this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal">overlay journals</a>: the papers are linked to an archive site; the journal only deals with peer-review.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/795530330052493312">I was also recently rather disappointed</a> by PLoS CB, after a paper got rejected 10 month after submission on the sole basis of interest. Based on the reactions I received, this is not an isolated case. Anyway, PLoS CB practices editorial pre-selection, which is highly subjective. As for other prestigious journals, its prestige is precisely based on its relatively low acceptance rate. But this is a highly questionable model, because it is wasteful: wasting the time of authors who submit the same paper to many journals, wasting the time of reviewers who write reports that are thrown away. In my opinion, it is also perverse. It gives a label of quality to individual papers and scientists based on the opinion of just a couple of scientists, sampled by one editor, and this <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/you-are-not-a-good-scientist-if-you-use-impact-factors-for-evaluating-research/">insignificant label</a> is then used by various committees (grants, promotions, hiring). It also pushes authors into boosting their claims to pass the editorial barrier. The solution to this is <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-praise-of-post-publication-review/">post-publication review</a> (see also <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1718">Michael Eisen’s post)</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">So ideally, I would like to see an overlay journal practicing post-publication review in my field. The question now is: should we create one? What would be needed is the technical infrastructure, but I am not sure it is fully available yet (as regards the post-publication review system, indexing etc).</p>
<p align="justify">Alternatively, we could use a general post-publication review journal. There is for example <a href="https://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a>. <a href="https://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> also does this partially (publishing the reviews is an option). Both cost about $1000 per article; both are run by companies. But they are less expensive than alternative open access journals (PLoS ONE: $1495; eNeuro: $1950 for members, $2925 otherwise), and more open. None of these two journals is ideal, but they represent some progress over conventional journals.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two issues with choosing a general journal. First, there is the question of editors. I have no experience with these journals so I am not sure there is the relevant expertise in the editorial board. I have seen a couple of computational neuroscientists in PeerJ though. The second issue is visibility. One idea could be to manage a list of computational neuroscience papers, to which anyone could submit a reference or preprint, in addition to automatic additions (say from relevant journals + keyword alerts). One would simply subscribe to the list (RSS feed or email alert).</p>
<p align="justify">Any good ideas are welcome!</p>
<h1 align="justify">Update (6.1.2017)</h1>
<p>Some more information and thought following comments on this text:</p>
<ul>
<li>One issue for an overlay journal is to get it indexed in Pubmed. This seems quite important for a neuroscience journal, but the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/ejournals.html">indexing requirements</a> seem to be pretty much contradictory with the idea of an overlay journal, as it requires XML-tagged data of its bibliographic citations. But maybe this could be negotiable? (see "Optional arrangement"). Some more general information about indexing <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/38">here</a>.</li>
<li>Other issue is more technical; to get an automatic post-publication review system.</li>
<li>Finally a general thought; there is no reason why this should be specific to computational neuroscience. However, this could be a first step towards a more generalized system.</li>

If you believe certain creationists, Darwin sought examples of Tasmanian skulls in order to prove that this unfortunate race was a 'missing link' between humans and apes. However, according to John van Wyhe in a new paper called Darwin's body-snatchers?, this story has zero basis in fact.

            <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">A lot has been written about impact factors, and why </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">they are a poor indicator </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of article quality </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(just <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=impact+factor">google it</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Even for the one thing that the impact factor is meant to measure, ie, future citations, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">it performs badly</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are now many empirical studies on this</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Sadly, in 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">scientists in hiring or promotion committees still </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">value impact factors very highly, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">especially in life sciences</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Yes, in a domain of science that is meant to be highly empirical, scientists </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">still</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> prefer to </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">look away </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">from compelling evidence </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">that impact factors should not be used for evaluating research</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Recently, in a PhD thesis committee, we were discussing the grade and one member, a</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">n</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> experimental biologist, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">raised the issue that the candidate had not published in the highest ranked journals</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We opposed that we were there precisely to evaluate the manuscript itself </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">as a whole</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">not some elements of CV</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">He admitted later that he had not read the thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">I could </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">simply cite the overwhelming evidence</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">But I want to make a simpler point </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of statistics</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Many things are wrong with using impact factors, but let us just consider the one thing it is meant for, ie, predicting the number of future citations of papers. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We know that </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">for any journal,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> the </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">distributions of citations is very broad and highly skewed</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2126010/pdf/9056804.pdf">Seglen (1997)</a>, “articles in the most cited half of articles in a journal are cited 10 times as often as the least cited half”. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">In practice, if you are given the name of the journal in which a paper has been published, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">you will </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">not </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">know </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">its future number of citations</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. F</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">rom a purely statistical point of view, journal name is just no</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">t very</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> significant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">E</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">xamples are sometimes more convincing that hard facts. So from the </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">paper </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> just cited, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">number of citations vs. impact factor for all publications of 4 scientists</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/impact.png"><img alt="impact" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1301" height="300" src="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/impact-274x300.png" width="274" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">N</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">ow look at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lEHiPU4AAAAJ">my own publication statistics</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">To be more rigorous, I should calculate the citations per year, but the point is obvious enough. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">My top 3 cited papers </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">were published in</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">: </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">J. Neurophys </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(IF 2.8); </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">J. Comp. Neuro (IF 1.8); Frontiers in Neuroinformatic</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">s</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(IF 1.3). </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This third paper (on the Brian simulator) was published in 2008, and the same year I had a paper in Neuron, which has gathered about 4 times fewer citations. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">And this is </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">in spite of the fact that papers published in big journals are obviously much more visible </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(ie there is an expected boost in citations that is unrelated to article quality)</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">s this really surprising? In a big journal, just like in a small journal, decisions are based on n = 2 or 3 reviewers, selected by one editor, i.e. a biased sample of size 2/3; </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">just after an editorial selection based on n = 1 editor, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">in many cases</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> not a professional scientist</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">It’s 2016 </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">and</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> life scientists have been </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">recently </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">warned repeatedly that </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">good statistics </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">require</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> large </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">unbiased </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">samples, but </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">impact factors, totally insignificant pieces of information, are </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">still </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">broadly used </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">to distribute grants and make careers</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">So yes, us</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">ing</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> impact factors </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">as a proxy </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">to evaluate the quality of papers or of their authors </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">is a display </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">poor scientific </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">practice</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">To me the problem with this is so not much that bad decisions are being made, but that it has a huge influence on the way science is done. Scientists know that they are being evaluated in this way, and this influences their research (especially for students and postdocs) so that </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">it meets the editorial biases of the big journals. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">In 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley published </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">120 </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">pages in J</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">ournal of Physiology, basically defining the field of electrophysiology</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Who would </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">take the risk </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of doing</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> this today at the age of 35, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">instead of </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">a </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">career-making 4-page Nature paper</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">?</span></p>

Restoring Active Memory (RAM) is a DARPA  research program that aims to enhance memory in  military personnel who have suffered traumatic brain injuries. The goal is to design an implant, or “memory prosthesis,” that will treat memory loss via electrical stimulation.

 Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts by definition, recent studies have shown that a fraction of putative small open reading frames within lncRNAs are translated. However, the biological significance of these hidden polypeptides is still unclear. Here we identify and functionally characterize a novel polypeptide encoded by the lncRNA LINC00961. This polypeptide is conserved between human and mouse, is localized to the late endosome/lysosome and interacts with the lysosomal v-ATPase to negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. This regulation of mTORC1 is specific to activation of mTORC1 by amino acid stimulation, rather than by growth factors. Hence, we termed this polypeptide ‘small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response’ (SPAR). We show that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is highly expressed in a subset of tissues and use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to develop a SPAR-polypeptide-specific knockout mouse while maintaining expression of the host lncRNA. We find that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is downregulated in skeletal muscle upon acute injury, and using this in vivo model we establish that SPAR downregulation enables efficient activation of mTORC1 and promotes muscle regeneration. Our data provide a mechanism by which mTORC1 activation may be finely regulated in a tissue-specific manner in response to injury, and a paradigm by which lncRNAs encoding small polypeptides can modulate general biological pathways and processes to facilitate tissue-specific requirements, consistent with their restricted and highly regulated expression profile.

 Lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and are critical for health. However, the role of metabolism in lymphatic development has not yet been elucidated. Here we report that in transgenic mouse models, LEC-specific loss of CPT1A, a rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, impairs lymphatic development. LECs use fatty acid β-oxidation to proliferate and for epigenetic regulation of lymphatic marker expression during LEC differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor PROX1 upregulates CPT1A expression, which increases acetyl coenzyme A production dependent on fatty acid β-oxidation. Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase p300 to acetylate histones at lymphangiogenic genes. PROX1–p300 interaction facilitates preferential histone acetylation at PROX1-target genes. Through this metabolism-dependent mechanism, PROX1 mediates epigenetic changes that promote lymphangiogenesis. Notably, blockade of CPT1 enzymes inhibits injury-induced lymphangiogenesis, and replenishing acetyl coenzyme A by supplementing acetate rescues this process in vivo.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21028">doi: 10.1038/nature21028</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Ie0nU-NTj4k" width="1" />
