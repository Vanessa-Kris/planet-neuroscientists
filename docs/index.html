<p style="text-align: left;">Exercising with the use of an interactive environment might be an interesting alternative to traditional methods of training. In this study, Barry and colleagues examined exercise using an interactive computer-generated environment (exergaming) compared with traditional gym-based exercise for postural control, flow and technology acceptance in healthy adult participants. A total of 44 participants were allocated to either the exergaming group or a traditional gym-based exercise group. The results suggested that exergaming had a bigger potential to improve postural control compared with standard exercise. Therefore exergaming might be employed as a great way of achieving rehabilitation goals and improving postural control.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="http://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-016-0095-3">The benefits of menu labeling</a></strong></h3>
<p>Is menu labeling a potential solution to the obesity epidemic? To investigate this question, Reale and Flint determined the effect of menu labeling on food choice among obese adults. They examined a sample of 61 obese adults motivated to lose weight in order to find out which menu labeling format was the most effective method of promoting healthy eating choices. The first form of menu labeling provided calorie content, the second form supplied information in grams for all seven categories (fat, saturated-fat, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, salt and fiber), and the third provided the energy expenditure. Interestingly, participants underestimated calorie content by an average of 303 kcal per meal. The study demonstrates that menu labeling had a positive impact on healthy food choices, with calorie labeling having the strongest impact of the three tested.</p>

<p>Low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) are commonly recommended approaches for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. This study by Barabas et al. investigated the knowledge of healthcare professionals about LCDs in obesity treatment in a Swedish primary healthcare setting. Although an LCD is suggested to have a positive effect in both diabetes care and weight loss, surprisingly a low number of healthcare professionals recommended an LCD for weight loss. Physicians and diabetes nurses were more eager to recommend the diet, whereas trained lifestyle counselors were the least keen. The study showed that healthcare professionals had differing attitudes towards a diet low in carbohydrates with their main concerns being a lack of scientific knowledge of the side- and long-term effects of such a diet. The authors suggest that additional education and medical training might have a positive impact on the awareness of LCDs in obesity treatment.</p>

<p>In the past three decades the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased significantly. The consumption of outside-the-home prepared meals is believed to be one of the obesity contributors. Using data from the University of Toronto Restaurant Database, this article reports the nutritional quality of kids’ meals from seven sit-down restaurants and ten fast food chains in Canada. The results indicated that kids’ meals from both types of restaurant contain high levels of sodium and saturated fat as well as being high in calories. Portions served in sit-down restaurants were bigger compared with fast-food places; however, when standardized per 100 g, sit-down restaurants served meals of a lower calorie and sodium content. These findings suggest that dealing with the poor nutritional quality of restaurant kids’ meals should be regarded as part of an obesity battle and a major public health goal.</p>

<p>People suffering from various cardiac diseases might employ pedometers to set activity goals, measure walking activity and improve their overall physiological and psychological health. In this study, Thorup and colleagues enrolled patients involved in a cardiac telerehabilitation program to investigate pedometer use and self-determined motivation for walking. A total of 11 patients, five nurses and six physiotherapists took part in the study and, thanks to the pedometer, the patients could tailor physical activity to their needs and lifestyle. Visible steps enhanced the awareness of walking activity and enabled them to set realistic goals and thus pedometers helped the patients to change their lifestyle into a healthier one, where walking activity became a daily routine.</p>

<h3><a href="https://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-016-0125-1"><strong>A crucial time in the life of students</strong></a></h3>
<p>‘Freshman 15’ refers to the phenomenon that students gain on average 15lbs (6.8kg) over their first academic year. In this study, Vadeboncoeur and colleagues evaluated weight change among first year university students. They recruited 215 students from 23 universities in England asking them to report their weight at three time points: (i) at the beginning of academic year, (ii) before Christmas, and (iii) at the end of academic year. They observed an increase in weight by 0.98 kg over the period of an academic year and, interestingly, there was no significant difference in mean weight change rate between females and males (+1.04 kg and +0.85 kg respectively). These findings suggest that the first year at university appears to be a crucial time when people tend to gain weight; therefore universities must acknowledge their role in promoting healthy behaviors among students in order to prevent the obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>Most research into the emotion of awe – a response to something vast or overwhelming – has focused on its positive upsides, classing it alongside delight or pleasure. But the University of California’s Greater Good research programme recently published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> the first <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-59114-001/">full investigation</a> of what they call “threatening awe” defined as a strong feeling of wonder and fear.</p>
<p>Amie Gordon and her team looked at times where people felt awe in response to overwhelming stimuli like huge storms or the vastness of the universe, or were exposed for the first time to accounts of historical horrors such as the Vietnam war. Skin conductance and heart rate measures showed that feeling the threatening version of awe activated the sympathetic autonomic nervous system, which is associated with negative emotional states. The data also suggested that feeling threatening awe rather than the positive kind may be influenced by thoughts which make us actively feel powerless – the prospect of being trapped on the pitiless ocean – rather than simply small, such as reflecting on the vastness of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Whereas previous work has shown awe to be associated with wellbeing and life satisfaction, one of the new experiments involving 603 participants found that an ominous video with swirling tornadoes, associated with threat-based awe, produced lower wellbeing compared to a positive awe-filled video and even a neutral one. Gordon’s team pointed out that the word awe produces two offspring with very different connotations: awesome and awful. Gazing into the face of God, or the vastness of the cosmos, isn’t a sunshine and kittens experience: awe exists in the “upper reaches of pleasure and on the boundary of fear”.</p>

<img alt="Montecincla fairbanki" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Montecincla-fairbanki-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>India is a biogeographic crossroads — a meeting place of different regions with distinct types of species. Although India is biodiverse, the high species richness of the subcontinent is often attributed to the fact that groups from the surrounding regions have been able to colonize and occupy various ecosystems. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom held that most animals in the Indian subcontinent were representatives of groups that were more diverse in other regions and that there were few, if any, distinctly Indian groups — ones that originated and speciated within the landmass.</p>
<p>Recent studies are beginning to challenge these ideas, particularly in some groups of amphibians and reptiles. In our recent study, we now show that there are in fact two groups of birds, <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, that have also diversified within India. This is surprising because birds are thought to be really well-studied and these species have been know to science for a long time. Nevertheless, scientists had underestimated the true diversity of these groups and therefore the uniqueness of the avifauna of this region.</p>
<blockquote><p>conventional wisdom held…there were few, if any, distinctly Indian groups</p></blockquote>
<p>To address the history of taxonomic confusion surrounding these birds, we devised a strategy to examine their evolutionary relationships. Using a combination of modern analyses and gathering a suite of data – genetic, morphometric, song, and plumage – we examined the distinct differences between populations across their range and determined their phylogenetic position to decipher their closest relatives.</p>
<p>Our results conclusively showed that these two groups were older and more distinct than previously thought and had diversified into multiple species. These two groups of birds, now referred to as <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, represent the first known examples of birds that have speciated within the Indian subcontinent as endemic radiations.</p>
<p>Our results have substantial implications for our knowledge of biodiversity and biogeography. First, it indicates that there is still much to be discovered about birds, even in well-inhabited regions. Second, the divergence patterns of these birds reveal the history of the Indian landscape and the role of climatic events in driving diversification. Finally, the dramatic increase in unique species with narrower ranges pushes the urgency of conservation in this vulnerable ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity hiding in plain sight</strong></p>
<p>Both <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> are endemic to the Western Ghats, a coastal mountainous region in southwestern India. Their specific habitat is restricted to the highest elevation zone in what is called Shola forest — a unique form of evergreen forest interspersed with natural grassland that is found only on this mountain range. Species like <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, which are restricted to these high montane areas, have patchy distributions within and across these ‘sky islands’ where montane habitat is similar to oceanic islands separated by deep valleys of unsuitable areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>…there are still many mysteries to be uncovered in birds.</p></blockquote>
<p>We conducted detailed field surveys across all the sky islands over a period of eight years and examined an unprecedented number (800) of individual birds for this project. Over this period, we measured body features, recorded song, noted plumage variation, and collected blood for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>Whereas previously each group was thought to be one or two species (taxonomists disagreed), we show with ample evidence each group had diversified across the mountain range and had more species than currently recognized. This meant we had to revise and describe new species – an exciting yet daunting challenge given the debate amongst ornithologists on how to recognize distinct species (species concepts). There were multiple opinions, even amongst our co-authors, but we ultimately converged on an approach to delimit species that fulfilled the requirements of multiple species concepts.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8572" style="width: 1610px;"><img alt="Sholicola ashambuensis" class="size-full wp-image-8572" height="1143" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Sholicola-ashambuensis.jpg" width="1600" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>Sholicola ashambuensis</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source">Shashank Dalvi.</div></figure>
<p>To complicate matters further, our phylogenetic analyses showed that neither of the two groups we studied belonged with the genera in which they were traditionally placed. Although they were originally thought to be shortwings and laughingthrushes respectively, <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> do not belong with these groups. Their new positions in the bird tree of life, as distinct lineages and highly divergent from their closest relatives (and not near the genera they were previously classified in), make it imperative to place them into new genera.</p>
<p>Why so much excitement about new genera and species of birds? Some of this is due to expectation. For some other groups, like beetles, the rate of new species discovery is still steep and therefore adding new species to the list is fairly commonplace. For birds, on the other hand, many believe we have already discovered 99% of all the living species. New studies like this one highlight that there are still many mysteries to be uncovered in birds. This study also shows the value of phylogenetics and systematic analyses. We may have described the vast majority of species, but the taxonomy of birds is far from being clear, and this can mislead subsequent studies.</p>
<p><strong>Past connections and current isolation</strong></p>
<p>One of the big mysteries of Indian biogeography is how organisms got to the Western Ghats. The closest mountain range, the Himalayas, is several hundred miles to the north and intervening is a large expanse of dry, seasonal, lowland habitat. One theory, known as the Satpura Hypothesis, proposes that montane groups were able to migrate from the Himalayas using the hill ranges in central India as a corridor. Although wetter than other parts of peninsular India, the Satpura hills are much lower and many high elevation species do not currently occur on them. However, we know that suitable habitat for these species might have existed in the past when global temperatures were cooler and India was covered in moist forest. One way to test the Satpura Hypothesis was to examine the origin of the Western Ghats birds.</p>
<p>Remarkably, our analyses showed that the pattern and timing of divergence in these two groups of birds were nearly identical and occurred at similar times. This lends support to the idea that landscape level changes, as implied by the Satpura Hypothesis, led to the isolation of these populations on their respective sky islands. Both <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> diverged from their closest relatives in the Himalayas and Southeast Asia around 11 million years ago. This coincides with a period of heightened tectonic activity in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau that led to the aridification of the Indian subcontinent, thereby shifting from moist to dry forest. We hypothesize that due to this drying, these cool-adapted birds were isolated in the Western Ghats, the only suitable habitat at the time. Subsequent climate shifts, which limited dispersal across the sky islands, lead to further isolation events across the deep valleys of this mountain range.</p>

<p><strong>A biodiversity hotspot becomes hotter</strong></p>
<p>India, being a developing nation with over a billion people, has to reconcile tremendous pressures on natural ecosystems and its extraordinary biodiversity. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Western Ghats where the interests of people, agriculture, and wildlife collide. This biodiversity hotspot is home not just to unique species but also a diversity of cultures, all of which are threatened by anthropogenic impacts such as economic development and climate change.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were the first research team in decades to obtain permissions to handle birds across this landscape</p></blockquote>
<p>The crucial need for additional scientific studies to study this distinct region is becoming increasing apparent as modern studies like ours uncover dramatically more biodiversity. The type of study we conducted is rare in India and was only possible with persistence and some luck in acquiring the necessary permissions to handle birds, which is challenging in a country that is apprehensive about interference with wildlife. Nevertheless, the field crew, led by Robin and Vishnudas, were supported by a long-term research permit specifically from the Forest Department in the state of Kerala that was able to grasp the importance of this work. We were thus the first research team in decades to obtain permissions to handle birds across this landscape. We hope the results of our study makes the need to facilitate scientific studies an important and urgent venture across all states in the face of increasing threats.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope our study will help to highlight this exceptional and diverse region in terms of the need for more conservation efforts. In additional to their scientific value, birds can generate enormous interest in non-scientists from avid bird-watchers to casual nature observers. We gave our new taxa names inspired by local words for these birds and their habitat. This has already aroused national pride –our publication was released on Republic Day and enthusiastically picked up by supporters and newspapers with the hashtag #MadeInIndia! We hope these new discoveries will not only elevate the protective status of these birds and their shrinking habitat but also encourage interest in studying and preserving the long-term survival of other Western Ghats fauna and flora.</p>

<p>
 The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease.

<p>
 Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.

<p>
 Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell-specific enzyme that targets immunoglobulin genes to initiate class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. In addition, through off-target activity, AID has a much broader effect on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations and mutations involved in the development and progression of lymphoma. AID expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) pathway regulates AID by suppressing its expression in B cells. Drugs for leukaemia or lymphoma therapy such as idelalisib, duvelisib and ibrutinib block PI3Kδ activity directly or indirectly, potentially affecting AID expression and, consequently, genomic stability in B cells. Here we show that treatment of primary mouse B cells with idelalisib or duvelisib, and to a lesser extent ibrutinib, enhanced the expression of AID and increased somatic hypermutation and chromosomal translocation frequency to the Igh locus and to several AID off-target sites. Both of these effects were completely abrogated in AID-deficient B cells. PI3Kδ inhibitors or ibrutinib increased the formation of AID-dependent tumours in pristane-treated mice. Consistently, PI3Kδ inhibitors enhanced AID expression and translocation frequency to IGH and AID off-target sites in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, and patients treated with idelalisib, but not ibrutinib, showed increased somatic hypermutation in AID off-targets. In summary, we show that PI3Kδ or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase genomic instability in normal and neoplastic B cells by an AID-dependent mechanism. This effect should be carefully considered, as such inhibitors can be administered to patients for years.

<p>
 Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) integrates nutrient signals to control cell growth and organismal homeostasis across eukaryotes. The evolutionarily conserved GATOR complex regulates mTORC1 signalling through Rag GTPases, and GATOR1 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for RAGA and RAGB (RAGA/B) and GATOR2 has been proposed to be an inhibitor of GATOR1. Furthermore, the metazoan-specific SESN proteins function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RAGA/B, and interact with GATOR2 with unknown effects. Here we show that SZT2 (seizure threshold 2), a metazoan-specific protein mutated in epilepsy, recruits a fraction of mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2 to form a SZT2-orchestrated GATOR (SOG) complex with an essential role in GATOR- and SESN-dependent nutrient sensing and mTORC1 regulation. The interaction of SZT2 with GATOR1 and GATOR2 was synergistic, and an intact SOG complex was required for its localization at the lysosome. SZT2 deficiency resulted in constitutive mTORC1 signalling in cells under nutrient-deprived conditions and neonatal lethality in mice, which was associated with failure to inactivate mTORC1 during fasting. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells could be partially corrected by overexpression of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5, and by the lysosome-targeted GATOR2 component WDR59 or lysosome-targeted SESN2. These findings demonstrate that SZT2 has a central role in dictating GATOR-dependent nutrient sensing by promoting lysosomal localization of SOG, and reveal an unexpected function of lysosome-located GATOR2 in suppressing mTORC1 signalling through SESN recruitment.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/GGKY-mCGCkg/nature21372">Untimely expression of gametogenic genes in vegetative cells causes uniparental disomy</a></h4>

<p>
 Uniparental disomy (UPD), in which an individual contains a pair of homologous chromosomes originating from only one parent, is a frequent phenomenon that is linked to congenital disorders and various cancers. UPD is thought to result mostly from pre- or post-zygotic chromosome missegregation. However, the factors that drive UPD remain unknown. Here we use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to investigate UPD, and show that defects in the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery or in the YTH domain-containing RNA elimination factor Mmi1 cause high levels of UPD in vegetative diploid cells. This phenomenon is not due to defects in heterochromatin assembly at centromeres. Notably, in cells lacking RNAi components or Mmi1, UPD is associated with the untimely expression of gametogenic genes. Deletion of the upregulated gene encoding the meiotic cohesin Rec8 or the cyclin Crs1 suppresses UPD in both RNAi and mmi1 mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Rec8 is sufficient to trigger UPD in wild-type cells. Rec8 expressed in vegetative cells localizes to chromosomal arms and to the centromere core, where it is required for localization of the cohesin subunit Psc3. The centromeric localization of Rec8 and Psc3 promotes UPD by uniquely affecting chromosome segregation, causing a reductional segregation of one homologue. Together, these findings establish the untimely vegetative expression of gametogenic genes as a causative factor of UPD, and provide a solid foundation for understanding this phenomenon, which is linked to diverse human diseases.

<p>
 Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and has a role in the regulation of metabolism through the release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with an adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown adipose tissue—brown especially—into ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3′ UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine.

<p>
 The diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) is increasing owing to more sensitive detection methods, and this increase is creating challenges for clinical management. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 102 primary PanNETs and defined the genomic events that characterize their pathogenesis. Here we describe the mutational signatures they harbour, including a deficiency in G:C &gt; T:A base excision repair due to inactivation of MUTYH, which encodes a DNA glycosylase. Clinically sporadic PanNETs contain a larger-than-expected proportion of germline mutations, including previously unreported mutations in the DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2 and BRCA2. Together with mutations in MEN1 and VHL, these mutations occur in 17% of patients. Somatic mutations, including point mutations and gene fusions, were commonly found in genes involved in four main pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling (including previously undescribed EWSR1 gene fusions), and telomere maintenance. In addition, our gene expression analyses identified a subgroup of tumours associated with hypoxia and HIF signalling.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/keU46FiwJm4/nature21060">Sterile protection against human malaria by chemoattenuated PfSPZ vaccine</a></h4>

<p>
 A highly protective malaria vaccine would greatly facilitate the prevention and elimination of malaria and containment of drug-resistant parasites. A high level (more than 90%) of protection against malaria in humans has previously been achieved only by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) inoculated by mosquitoes; by intravenous injection of aseptic, purified, radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ (‘PfSPZ Vaccine’); or by infectious PfSPZ inoculated by mosquitoes to volunteers taking chloroquine or mefloquine (chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites). We assessed immunization by direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, non-irradiated PfSPZ (‘PfSPZ Challenge’) to malaria-naive, healthy adult volunteers taking chloroquine for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (vaccine approach denoted as PfSPZ-CVac). Three doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge at 28-day intervals were well tolerated and safe, and prevented infection in 9 out of 9 (100%) volunteers who underwent controlled human malaria infection ten weeks after the last dose (group III). Protective efficacy was dependent on dose and regimen. Immunization with 3.2 × 103 (group I) or 1.28 × 104 (group II) PfSPZ protected 3 out of 9 (33%) or 6 out of 9 (67%) volunteers, respectively. Three doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ at five-day intervals protected 5 out of 8 (63%) volunteers. The frequency of Pf-specific polyfunctional CD4 memory T cells was associated with protection. On a 7,455 peptide Pf proteome array, immune sera from at least 5 out of 9 group III vaccinees recognized each of 22 proteins. PfSPZ-CVac is a highly efficacious vaccine candidate; when we are able to optimize the immunization regimen (dose, interval between doses, and drug partner), this vaccine could be used for combination mass drug administration and a mass vaccination program approach to eliminate malaria from geographically defined areas.

<img alt="Coffee break, pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Coffee-break-pixabay-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Greetings from <em>BMC Proceedings</em>.</p>
<p>Before we talk about anything else, an introduction is probably in order. My name’s Tom Rowles and, as of October 2016, I’m the Editor of <em>BMC Proceedings</em>. I’ve spent the last few months getting to know the journal and coming up with plans for the future, and I’d like to use this post to update you on some exciting changes which are currently happening.</p>
<p><strong>What is <em>BMC Proceedings?</em></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, <em>BMC Proceedings</em> is an academic journal whose sole purpose is to publish conference proceedings, including full-length articles, abstracts and meeting reports. Our aim is to widely disseminate the valuable material that is collected and presented at academic meetings, as well as to try and capture and distil the essence of the conference, and to provide exposure to the valuable meetings and conversations that take place during the conference, though meeting reports.</p>
<p>Conferences are where research and medical communities come together, and we want to serve those communities by offering a service whereby conferences can extend their reach beyond the few days upon which the meeting takes place. Proceedings can do this, indefinitely extending the life of a conference, and providing a resource both for attendees, and those unable to make it.</p>
<p>We also feel that, for all of their worth, conferences tend to operate as a closed system. All of the valuable information that is presented at a meeting, however useful and relevant to your own research, is for naught if you are unable to attend. We therefore see our role as making conferences open-access, in the same manner that BioMed Central has done for full research publications, and ensuring that cutting-edge scientific research and debate, as well as the guidelines and consensus reports that are often debated at international meetings, reach the researchers and practitioners that need it, wherever they might be in the world.</p>
<p><strong>New scope</strong></p>
<p>Up until this point, <em>BMC Proceedings</em> has, similarly to all other journals in the BMC series, published only articles and proceedings dealing with either the biological or medical sciences. However, from February 14<sup>th</sup> 2017, both<em> BMC Proceedings </em>and <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Research Notes</em></a> will be considering submissions from all scientific and clinical disciplines. You can find out more about the change of scope in <em>BMC Research Notes</em>, as well as other exciting ongoing developments in that journal <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/14/bmc-research-notes-goes-back-roots/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What will this mean in practice? Well, from now on <em>BMC Proceedings </em>will consider publishing articles, abstracts and reports from meetings in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology and life sciences</li>
<li>Clinical and medical</li>
<li>Medical and scientific education</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Bioethics and international health &amp; human rights</li>
<li>Research methodology</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Geo-sciences and environmental/earth sciences</li>
<li>Marine biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Materials sciences</li>
<li>Psychology</li>
<li>Paleontology</li>
</ul>
<p>With such an extensive list of subject areas now suitable for consideration, is there anything that we won’t be considering? Well yes; we will still be unable to consider meetings on law (except for when they are directly related to international health &amp; human rights), humanities and arts. However, if you are unsure as to whether your conference would be suitable for consideration as a proceeding then I would encourage you to <a href="mailto:supplements@biomedcentral.com">contact us</a>, and either myself or one of our supplements team will be able to advise you further.</p>
<p>Over the coming months and years we hope that <em>BMC Proceedings </em>can become a hub for research communities to present and share their conferences. We therefore hope that you can join us and, if you are organising a conference and looking for a means to broaden its impact, then please do get in touch at <a href="mailto:supplements@biomedcentral.com">supplements@biomedcentral.com</a>.</p>

<img alt="Featured image" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Featured-image-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Within scholarly publishing, the phrase dark data has been used to describe research outputs that are not usually considered in traditional research journals such as single observations. As a result, these research outputs often never see the light of day and remain hidden in researchers’ notebooks or buried as some extra data to be considered further one day in the future. However, there are many advantages in helping researchers to publish their dark data such as the reduction in duplicating research and the dissemination of fragmented findings or null results potentially useful to the research community.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our vision for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> is to build a unique, high profile journal focusing on short research notes</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Research Notes</em></a> was launched in 2008 as part of the <em>BMC</em> series with the aim to help free up dark data and provide a home for material that lacked a suitable publication outlet. In 2011, as the journal had begun to receive full-length research articles, both as direct submissions and transfers from other journals, we broadened its remit to include such articles. Whilst there has clearly been a need for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> to consider full-length research articles, doing so has masked the original vision of the journal as something different; a place where short observations, which might otherwise be unknown, can be made available to the global research community.</p>
<p>We are still committed to providing a home for all scientifically valid research outputs across the <em>BMC</em> series. Full-length research articles which would previously have been considered by <em>BMC Research Notes</em> can find a home in the relevant <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/">subject specific journals</a> in the <em>BMC</em> series as outlined in a <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/12/05/vital-importance-inclusive/">recent blog</a> discussing the editorial threshold for these journals.</p>
<p><strong>The “new” <em>BMC Research Notes</em></strong></p>
<p>We are bringing the journal back to its roots with a focus on shorter research notes that aim to bring dark data out of the shadows. The journal will once again focus on less conventional research outputs such as updates to previous work, additions to established methods, single observations and null results that are often overlooked. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> will publish articles without bias and will take the focus away from story-telling to making all valid research outputs freely and openly accessible.<img alt="subjects" class="wp-image-8566 aligncenter" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/subjects.jpg" width="584" /></p>
<p>To increase clarity and simplicity, we have reduced the number of article types and created <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-note">‘Research note’</a>, the journals’ main article format. ‘Research note’ has a word limit making it a true note article, structured in introduction, main text and limitations. We believe our new article type will ensure research is easy to digest for readers while being of maximum benefit by clearly stating the objective of the work presented as well as its limitations.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BMC Research Notes</em> will publish articles without bias and will take the focus away from story-telling</p></blockquote>
<p>Dark data is being generated by researchers of all disciplines across the world. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> aspires to serve a broad and global research community. As a result, the journal will expand its scope to include all scientific and clinical disciplines, i.e. health sciences and medicine, life sciences, physical sciences including all engineering disciplines, computer science and mathematics as well as related disciplines such as science education, bioethics and research methodology.</p>
<p>Our vision for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> is to build a unique, high profile journal focusing on short research notes that will serve as a dedicated open access forum for research outputs which would otherwise remain unknown. As part of the established <em>BMC</em> series, the journal’s primary goal is to serve the global scientific and clinical research communities.</p>

<p>Studies show that when heterosexual women look at other women’s bodies, they, just like men, tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time looking at their waists, hips and breasts, as if estimating how much they will appeal to men. This is consistent with “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/03/david-buss-derogation-of-competitors/">mate selection theory</a>” which argues, among other things, that women have evolved strategies to monitor potential love rivals. However, psychologists are interested in this topic, not only from an evolutionary perspective, but also because women who feel dissatisfied with their bodies, and who are vulnerable to developing eating disorders, may be especially pre-occupied with comparing their body against others, potentially exacerbating their anxieties.</p>
<p>Past research is mixed: some studies suggest women with body dissatisfaction and/or eating disorders pay disproportionate attention to the bodies of thin women, other studies suggest the opposite. A new <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-015-0726-1?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">exploratory paper</a> in <em>Psychological Research</em> says hang on a minute, we don’t actually know much about how healthy, confident women behave when they look at other women, nor whether their attention is influenced by their feelings about their own bodies.</p>
<p><span id="more-19105"></span></p>
<p>Amelia Cundall and Kun Guo at the University of Lincoln asked 33 female heterosexual psychology undergrads to don eye-tracking equipment while they looked at several realistic female computer avatars of different body shapes (from size 6 to size 18 based on UK high-street dress sizes), wearing either tight-fitting or loose clothing, and while they rated each one in terms of attractiveness and estimated dress size. The participants also rated their satisfaction with their own bodies (separately for face, breast, waist, hips, arms and legs); answered questions about how much they tend to compare their physical appearance to others; and the researchers also recorded their body-mass index (BMI), dress and cup size.</p>
<p>Somewhat consistent with past research, overall the participants spent more time looking at the waist and hip region of the models’ bodies. After that, they spent an equal amount of time looking at their head, upper-body and legs, and the least amount of time looking at their arms. “As women tend to deposit a larger amount of fat onto the lower body parts … these regions may contain more diagnostic cures for body attractiveness and body size assessment than other body regions such as the arms,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of attractiveness ratings, the participants rated the slimmer models as more attractive and the size 18 women as least attractive. But “thinner is not necessarily more attractive”, the researchers pointed out, because size 6 was rated as less attractive than 8, 10, and 12, and seen on a par with size 14. The participants gave slimmer women the same attractiveness ratings regardless of whether they wore tight-fitting or loose clothing, but they rated women of size 12 and up as being more attractive, and estimated them as having a smaller dress size, when they wore loose clothes.</p>
<p>Contrary to past findings, there was no link between participants’ own body satisfaction or their body size and the relative amounts of time they spent looking at the on-screen models that they considered more or less attractive, indicating a lack of either a harmful or self-protective bias, respectively. This may be because the participants were all generally confident in their own bodies and they had healthy below-average BMIs whereas past research that’s revealed these kind of viewing biases has studied women with body satisfaction concerns and eating disorders.</p>
<p>However, the participants in the current research who reported lower overall satisfaction with their own bodies did tend to say that they were more inclined to compare themselves against others. And in terms of where they looked when looking at the women on-screen, the more satisfied the participants were with a particular body area of their own, the less they tended to look at that area on the models. “Self-satisfaction with a body region means the need for comparing that region is reduced and thus gaze is allocated at the neighbouring body areas that are also informative for body attractiveness and size assessment,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Irrespective of their body satisfaction ratings, the researchers also found a general pattern for participants’ with smaller chests to spend less time looking at the chest area of the models. “It seems having a smaller chest size may result in an unconscious avoidance of viewing other women’s chest area, possibly to preserve self esteem,” the researchers said. Meanwhile, there was also a tendency for the participants with a higher BMI to spend more time looking at the legs of the slim on-screen models, the opposite of a protective habit. “BMI … is a more changeable construct [than chest size]” the researchers said, “and therefore [one explanation is that] upward comparisons occur in an attempt for healthy self-improvement.”</p>
<p>This is a small, exploratory study with young students which obviously limits the broader conclusions that can be drawn. Some readers may also feel that research of this kind risks feeding the tendency for our culture to objectify women’s bodies. In its defence, the study has highlighted several interesting patterns in how women view and appraise other women’s bodies, each of which could be followed up by future research to potentially further our understanding of how and why, for some people, body dissatisfaction can develop into a more serious psychological problem.</p>

You cannot speak, gesture or even blink an eye. All means to share your thoughts, emotions and basic needs are entirely lost. For those in the advanced stages of <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS), a debilitating and eventually fatal degenerative motor neuron disease, this nightmare can become reality. At the most severe disease stages when all motor control is lost, the individual enters a completely locked-in state (CLIS), in which they retain full consciousness and cognitive function but are unable to communicate with the outside world. Prior attempts to develop tools to enable communication in those suffering from CLIS have failed, but a new study published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> used a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows, for the first time, accurate communication in CLIS patients.</p>
<p><strong>Probing communication with a <em>f</em>NIRS BCI</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824406" target="_blank">Past efforts</a> to communicate with CLIS patients employed BCIs using electrical brain signal from EEG or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography" target="_blank">electrocorticography</a> that depended upon voluntary control by patients over their neural responses. The authors of the new <em>PLOS Biology</em> study speculate that this requirement of at least partially intact somato-motor function for attention and learning may explain the failure of these BCIs in CLIS. They therefore tested whether a BCI based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy" target="_blank">functional near-infrared spectroscopy</a> (<em>f</em>NIRS), which measures brain oxygenation levels and does not involve voluntary modulation of neuroelectric responses during BCI training, may avoid these pitfalls and be a more effective communication tool.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, the team enrolled four advanced-stage ALS patients aged 24-76 who had entered a CLIS (or nearly-CLIS) 3-4 years after diagnosis. The patients had lost all ability to communicate and all motor function including eye movement, and were supported by ventilation and tube feeding. With the exception of one patient whose unique condition (a rare genetic mutation causing 1-2% of ALS cases) prevented her from completing training, all other participants performed a series of 46-60 sessions. During BCI training, patients were asked questions with known answers (i.e., <em>Paris is the capital of France</em>) and were prompted to mentally respond “yes” or “no.” A classifier was trained to recognize <em>f</em>NIRS brain signals associated with responses to positive versus negative questions. Training was followed by feedback sessions, in which patients responded to personal questions (i.e., <em>You were born in Berlin</em>) and were given feedback as to whether the BCI interpreted their response as “yes” or “no.” Finally, open sessions asked questions probing the patient’s quality of life (i.e., <em>You have back pain</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Breaking communication barriers</strong></p>
<p>The change in oxygenation during the response periods significantly differed between positive and negative questions. For comparison, neither the EEG signal nor eye movements reliably distinguished “yes” and “no” conditions, confirming that <em>f</em>NIRS was able to detect brain representations of the patients’ answers not measurable through neuroelectric or motor signals. Accuracy of the <em>f</em>NIRS classifier exceeded chance over 70% of the time, and was significantly more accurate than either the EEG or eye movement classifiers. Furthermore, BCI-determined answers between semantically paired questions were concordant for 67% or more of cases, highlighting consistency of the classifier. Why a change in brain oxygenation better informs about cognitive state than an electrical brain response isn’t entirely clear. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169323" target="_blank">study in animals</a> by the research team showed that increased oxygenation is associated with multiunit neural activity, suggesting that oxygenation measurable with <em>f</em>NIRS may reflect increased neural activation or coherence.</p>

(From Chaudhary et al., 2017)</figure>
<p>The <em>f</em>NIRS classifier was impressively accurate at decoding the patients’ responses, but what might explain its failure at some questions? Looking to the EEG for further insight, the researchers noted differences in middle frequency (theta/alpha) oscillations between the question and response periods, confirming that the patients are in distinct brain states when listening to and answering questions. Critically, theta power–a rhythm that increases during states of low arousal–was reduced when BCI classification of the patients’ responses was successful. This suggests that when low frequency activity dominates, the brain response is more obscure due to the patient’s low vigilance, and the BCI therefore fails to decode the patient’s answer. To ensure more accurate readings, an <em>f</em>NIRS classifier could theoretically be paired with EEG to identify when a patient is sufficiently alert to communicate.</p>
<p><strong>A bright future for the CLIS</strong></p>
<p>Before an <em>f</em>NIRS-based BCI will become commonplace for enabling communication in CLIS patients, there are important practical considerations. An <em>f</em>NIRS-EEG system would be financially costly and would require either extensive training of caretakers or the presence of a trained technician. Study coauthor Niels Birbaumer admits that the BCI may be prohibitively costly, but they recently fought and won for insurance coverage in Germany. He says that although “we have to make it more simple to avoid need of a technician,” with assistance from first author Ujwal Chaudhary, “one husband of a patient is using it already.” Furthermore, the cost/benefit ratio depends on how accurately the BCI can read the mental state of the CLIS individual. Birbaumer shares that they are refining their BCI to decode more complex brain signals, and explains that “EEG and invasive recordings have to be exploited in the future. EEG and <em>f</em>NIRS will be compared and if useful combined, we hope that other laboratories will join in.”</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles to implementing <em>f</em>NIRS for everyday use in non-communicative individuals, these successful case studies offer hope not only for restoring communication in advanced ALS, but also for understanding the cognitive and emotional states of those bound by a CLIS. Although the authors warn that they must “remain cautious about our judgments to open questions’ answers, particularly if it comes to quality of life,” the patients responded overwhelming positively to such questions. Birbaumer is optimistic about the potential of their findings to improve quality of life:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We hope that the attitude of patients, doctors and families may change and that more patients will decide for life when breathing becomes difficult and invasive ventilation necessary.”</p></blockquote>

<p>How do you get people to act in a climate friendly manner? The received wisdom is to push the basic message that climate change is real, humans have a hand in it, and we must mitigate it through action. But this approach hits a wall when people are disposed against that goal ideologically or because they simply don’t care enough. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/102/1/88/">New research</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> suggests another strategy: encourage environmental behaviours by linking them to goals that are already personally important.</p>
<p><span id="more-19098"></span></p>
<p>Kerrie Unsworth from the University of Leeds and Ilona McNeill from the University of Melbourne contacted 183 working adults who commuted in private vehicles, and asked them to imagine that their company was closing their car park to extend their premises, offering as compensation a public transport subsidy. In one condition, the decision was justified exclusively on environmental grounds, pointing out the benefits of reducing traffic density and jams, as well as increasing the proportion of energy-efficient vehicles on the road. Asked how they would react to the proposal, these participants responded much like those in a control condition where no justifications were given at all: with muted enthusiasm, and by saying they planned to persist with a car commute despite the obstacles.</p>
<p>But other participants responded much more positively. They’d read a justification for the car park closure that was not exclusively focused on the environment, but was also tied to a range of personal goals like saving cash, encouraging more exercise, and having more time to read. The same beneficial effect of linking to personal goals was found when looking at other environmental behaviours such as energy efficiency and waste reduction: participants shown links between these green behaviours and a range of personal goals were more likely to say they’d be willing to adopt the green behaviours. The more the linked goals mattered to an individual, the more enthusiastic they became about the environmental behaviour.</p>
<p>In a third study the researchers showed this approach can also predict broader pro-environment behaviours: participants who felt a green behaviour (in this case, sustainable energy use) supported their own goals were more likely to sign a petition supporting government policy in that area, even after controlling for their political views and their identification with being “environmental”.</p>
<p>Looking at this study reminds us to be humble when it comes to other people’s beliefs: it’s presumptuous to expect that people will care about your priorities because you tell them to. But it reminds us to be optimistic, because everyone cares about something – we are all pursuing what we believe to be good, as Socrates pointed out – meaning that we don’t need to wear people down from their own position, but build from where they are instead. Even motivated climate skeptics may care about nice holidays on cleaner beaches, or reducing societal atomisation by shifting from car-centred societies. Rather than dig in to ideological battles, we can find mutual benefits together.</p>

<img alt="An N. lecontei larva" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lecontei-Larva-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Plant-feeding insects stand out from all other organisms on the planet in two ways. First, they are unusually diverse: one out of every four species is an herbivorous insect. Second, most insect species specialize on particular types of plants to the exclusion of all other plants in their habitat.</p>
<p>One explanation for the pronounced diversity and specialization in herbivorous insects is that adaptation to new host plants frequently drives the formation of new species. To test this hypothesis, we must establish a direct link between traits that contribute to host adaptation and traits that prevent successful reproduction between species.</p>
<p>To investigate the link between host adaptation and speciation, we focused on a pair of closely related pine sawfly species (common pests of pine trees in North America) that differ in the pine species that they attack. While <em>Neodiprion pinetum </em>(the white pine sawfly) only attacks white pine, <em>Neodiprion lecontei </em>(the redheaded pine sawfly) attacks several other pine species, but generally avoids white pine.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 5194px;"><img alt="A hybrid larvae eating a pine needle " class="size-full wp-image-8552" height="3456" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Hybrid-Larvae.jpg" width="5184" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A hybrid larvae eating a pine needle</div><div class="attachment-image--source">R.K. Bagley</div></figure>
<p>We know that these two species can—and occasionally do—mate with one another. We have found them at the same collecting sites at the same time, and we have even collected hybrid larvae in the field. We have also crossed them in the lab and produced viable, fertile hybrid offspring. However, despite occasional hybridization, these species remain genetically, behaviorally, and morphologically distinct in the wild.</p>
<p>Together, our observations tell us that something is preventing <em>N. pinetum </em>and <em>N. lecontei </em>from merging into a single species. Some of our early crosses between these species in the lab hinted at one possible explanation. We noticed that when hybrid females laid their eggs on pines other than white pine, they hatched just fine. However, when hybrid females laid their eggs on white pine, the needles dried out and the eggs failed to hatch. In other words, something about the egg-laying behaviors of hybrid females was “off”.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8551" style="width: 256px;"><img alt="N. lecontei female uses her saw-like ovipositor to carve an egg pocket into a pine needle " class="size-full wp-image-8551" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Female-Ovipositing.png" width="246" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>N. lecontei</em> female uses her saw-like ovipositor to carve an egg pocket into a pine needle</div><div class="attachment-image--source">R.K. Bagley</div></figure>
<p>To lay their eggs, <em>Neodiprion </em>females carve individual egg-bearing pockets into the host needle, using a saw-like structure (ovipositor). In doing so, they face two challenges: circumventing the resins that protect the pine needles (which can drown eggs) and avoiding needle desiccation (which can also kill the eggs). Notably, the needles of white pine are considerably thinner and less resinous than those of the hosts typically preferred by <em>N. lecontei </em>females. We therefore predicted that <em>N. pinetum </em>females should have traits that minimize desiccation risk (e.g., fewer or smaller needle cuts), while <em>N. lecontei </em>females should have traits that circumvent host resins (e.g., deeper cuts that effectively drain resin).</p>
<p>Consistent with our predictions, we found the <em>N. pinetum </em>females laid fewer eggs per needle than <em>N. lecontei </em>females. <em>N. pinetum </em>females also never cut a resin-draining “preslit” (a non-egg bearing cut) at the base of the needle, while <em>N. lecontei </em>females always did. We also found that <em>N. pinetum </em>females had smaller, straighter “saws” than <em>N. lecontei </em>females, suggesting that these females make shallower needle cuts. Together these traits match our prediction that <em>N. pinetum </em>traits should minimize desiccation risk, while <em>N. lecontei </em>traits are expected to reduce resin flow to eggs (but increase desiccation risk).</p>

<p>But what do these traits look like in the hybrids? We found that hybrid females have a strong preference for white pine (like <em>N. pinetum </em>females), but have larger saws, lay more eggs per needle, and cut more preslits than <em>N. pinetum</em> females. This unfortunate combination of traits leads to needle desiccation and hatching failure, drastically reducing the ability of hybrid females to reproduce successfully. The poor egg-laying performance of hybrid females may explain, in part, how <em>N. lecontei </em>and <em>N. pinetum </em>remain distinct species despite occasional hybridization in the wild.</p>

<p>Our work demonstrates how maladaptive combinations of parental host-use traits can lead to reductions in fitness in hybrid individuals, which in turn limit gene flow between the parental species. This provides direct evidence that host adaptation contributes to the formation of new species. Additionally, our work suggests that adaptations for laying eggs on different hosts may be an especially important (but currently underappreciated) driver of speciation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/BhxHF_ZCBso/nature21355">m6A-dependent maternal mRNA clearance facilitates zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition</a></h4>

<p>
 The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is one of the most profound and tightly orchestrated processes during the early life of embryos, yet factors that shape the temporal pattern of vertebrate MZT are largely unknown. Here we show that over one-third of zebrafish maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified, and the clearance of these maternal mRNAs is facilitated by an m6A-binding protein, Ythdf2. Removal of Ythdf2 in zebrafish embryos decelerates the decay of m6A-modified maternal mRNAs and impedes zygotic genome activation. These embryos fail to initiate timely MZT, undergo cell-cycle pause, and remain developmentally delayed throughout larval life. Our study reveals m6A-dependent RNA decay as a previously unidentified maternally driven mechanism that regulates maternal mRNA clearance during zebrafish MZT, highlighting the critical role of m6A mRNA methylation in transcriptome switching and animal development.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/07KA7oMUV5E/nature21076">Metabolic gatekeeper function of B-lymphoid transcription factors</a></h4>

<p>
 B-lymphoid transcription factors, such as PAX5 and IKZF1, are critical for early B-cell development, yet lesions of the genes encoding these transcription factors occur in over 80% of cases of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The importance of these lesions in ALL has, until now, remained unclear. Here, by combining studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing and RNA sequencing, we identify a novel B-lymphoid program for transcriptional repression of glucose and energy supply. Our metabolic analyses revealed that PAX5 and IKZF1 enforce a state of chronic energy deprivation, resulting in constitutive activation of the energy-stress sensor AMPK. Dominant-negative mutants of PAX5 and IKZF1, however, relieved this glucose and energy restriction. In a transgenic pre-B ALL mouse model, the heterozygous deletion of Pax5 increased glucose uptake and ATP levels by more than 25-fold. Reconstitution of PAX5 and IKZF1 in samples from patients with pre-B ALL restored a non-permissive state and induced energy crisis and cell death. A CRISPR/Cas9-based screen of PAX5 and IKZF1 transcriptional targets identified the products of NR3C1 (encoding the glucocorticoid receptor), TXNIP (encoding a glucose-feedback sensor) and CNR2 (encoding a cannabinoid receptor) as central effectors of B-lymphoid restriction of glucose and energy supply. Notably, transport-independent lipophilic methyl-conjugates of pyruvate and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites bypassed the gatekeeper function of PAX5 and IKZF1 and readily enabled leukaemic transformation. Conversely, pharmacological TXNIP and CNR2 agonists and a small-molecule AMPK inhibitor strongly synergized with glucocorticoids, identifying TXNIP, CNR2 and AMPK as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the empirical finding that glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of B-lymphoid but not myeloid malignancies. Thus, B-lymphoid transcription factors function as metabolic gatekeepers by limiting the amount of cellular ATP to levels that are insufficient for malignant transformation.

As one of the more pervasive insect groups, ants are engaged in a vast range of symbiotic relationships. Army ants in particular serve as hosts to a diverse set of myrmecophiles (ant-loving species). It is believed that this is largely due to the army ant’s ability to gather large amounts of quality food, which attracts organisms to associate with the ant.</p>
<p>Army ants are a nomadic species that alternate between stages of traveling every night, and remaining at one nest site. Their nomadic lifestyle forces myrmecophiles to follow the ant colonies between sites. Beetles are among the organisms to associate with these army ant populations. They utilize various mechanisms that enable them to coexist with the army ants, including the release of chemical compounds and the display of protective body features among many. A <a href="https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-016-0010-x">new article published in <em>BMC Zoology</em></a> describes a new beetle species that travels on the backs of army ants, and investigates the mechanism by which this is accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>The unique attachment mechanism</strong></p>
<p>This new species, <em>Nymphister kronaueri </em>(pictured above)<em>, </em>was discovered in the rainforest at La Selva Biological Station (LSBS) in Costa Rica. The researchers for this study collected samples of the beetles along with the ants to which they were attached, and studied them further through morphological and genetic analysis. Through their analyses, these researchers were able to describe the unique method employed by these beetles that enables them to “hitchhike” with the nomadic army ants.</p>
<p>To attach to the host ant, the beetle tightly grips the ant’s body between the thorax and the abdomen (the two petiolar nodes) using its long, unique mandible. They are very particular about which part of the body they attach to, and display a clear preference to attach to those that are medium-sized. They also take their trips with the army ants at night, when the ants are traveling to their next nesting site during the emigration phase.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8541" style="width: 295px;"><img alt="Beetle traveling with ant" class="wp-image-8541 " height="205" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Fig-2-300x216.png" width="285" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Dorsal view of N. kronaueri traveling on the back of an army ant</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Munetoshi Maruyama</div></figure>
<p>The bodies of <em>N. kronaueri</em>  look quite similar to the stomach of army ants, making them difficult to spot when they are traveling on the ants’ backs (as seen in the picture to the right). It isn’t known why this resemblance is significant, but one possibility is to disguise the beetles from the ants themselves. This would allow the beetles to travel undetected. While there are other organisms that follow these traveling ant colonies on foot, it is believed that the unique attachment method used by <em>N. kronaueri</em>  is more advanced and saves energy.</p>
<p>Army ants have been known to associate with a great diversity of arthropods, however the <em>N. kronaueri</em> beetle has been investigated just recently. Therefore, it’s safe to assume that there is a multitude of other species waiting to be discovered. This study identified a unique mode of phoresy used by a new beetle species, so it would be beneficial to continue to research these communities. By continuing research into different army ant and arthropod species, we can provide more knowledge about the symbiotic relationships present in these communities.</p>

<p><em>by Leyla Loued-Khenissi</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/431/1*3TSqYocpiufRyh1DLy3lMg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Controversy in scientific research is a necessary feature of scientific advancement. Less common are controversies that spill out into the public domain, replete with glib, unconditional headlines that are neither written by scientists nor intended for a discerning public. In early 2016, such a controversy boiled over from a staid scientific journal to general media outlets. The story stemmed from a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full">paper in <em>PNAS</em></a> that scrutinized commonly used statistical methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). that yield an increased rate of false positives. fMRI is a method based on magnetic resonance that measures blood oxygenation (BOLD) levels in the brain with the use of a very powerful magnet. The BOLD signal is a proxy for brain activity — the more oxygen is recruited, the more the brain is working. This PNAS paper promptly bolstered many scientists’ suspicions about fMRI. The findings therein provided a necessary and valuable critique of MRI analysis methods and was thus an objective plus to the field, but the most galvanizing result was a collective meltdown in the neuroimaging community over our particular method of choice. It was the <a href="http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf">zombie fish scan(dal)</a> all over again, albeit with better statistics and without the comedic element to soften the blow.</p><p>Thankfully, since (and even prior) to the <em>PNAS</em> article, several suggestions have been outlined to address fMRI’s shortcomings. Notably, the <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1">Organization for Human Brain Mapping</a> (OHBM) committee advised fMRI researchers to <a href="http://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/keep-calm-and-scan-on">‘keep calm and scan on’</a>, providing a much needed dampening to the unbridled alarm the <em>PNAS</em> article triggered.</p><p>fMRI studies suffer from small sample sizes and costs associated with scanning time in addition to limited access and time constraints, as well as, in some cases, limited recruitment possibilities from a given population, all of which currently conspire to keep sample sizes low relative to what is needed to measure a meaningful effect size. One solution to low statistical power, which has been mentioned before, is to pool resources. Given limited resources, sharing has become part of the zeitgeist in other aspects of society, but it would seem especially well suited to scientific efforts, given their sources of funding (public) and universal mandate (collective progress). That is, we ought to share data while we wait for costs to go down and access to grow; costs will go down as time goes on. Not so long ago, data storage alone was a headache whereas now it is just a nuisance. Thankfully, the state of technology is like Southern California weather; if you don’t like it right now, just wait a minute.</p><p>While discussion has been rife within the neuroimaging community since the findings of the <em>PNAS</em> article rippled out to the general public, we must consider a loss of confidence in the fMRI method that cannot be explained away with more neuroimaging jargon. The imaging community’s response to colleagues that employ other methods, as well as to the layperson, has been muted though no less necessary. We must address the doubt that exists beyond neuroimagers to avoid needlessly relegating this incredible tool to the junkyard heap of pseudoscientific methods. A first point to outline is that, plausible deniability notwithstanding, fMRI is, as far as scientific methods go, a sexy method with an even sexier output. For years it has been emblematic of cutting edge technology and the potential of the future. Slap a high- or even low-resolution image of a brain scan on a product or promotional item and one’s tech cred (at least relative to non brain researchers) soars. Few technological advances have elicited such unabashed wonder in the eyes of the general public, who are often excluded from the less visually accessible wonders of scientific advances; nobody needs a degree to understand what a lit-up brain implies. Researchers that employ other methods, which yield just as galvanizing results albeit in a less visually appealing form, may have felt a nagging feeling that fMRI was unfairly stealing their thunder. Thus, just like the beautiful starlet, MRI has always been regarded with suspicion and its shortcomings more readily vulnerable to scrutiny. In a first instance then, it is of no surprise that the method’s (deserved) criticisms be highlighted as they have been.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/839/1*CpgX4cXx-6d4Zb0eHqnmwA.png" /></figure><p><em>Figure 1: What would you rather? a) Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)+ cells in rat Ventral Tegmental Area (Courtesy I. Zalachoras, Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, EPFL). b) EEG recording in the rat (Courtesy S. Astori, Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, EPFL) c) 36 year old male listening to instructions, fMRI (FWE = .05) (L. Loued-Khenissi, EPFL).</em></p><p>That MRI is less valid or reliable than other tools is, however, up for debate. Most other tools of the trade measure indirect indices, assess a quantity by its proxy, investigate a hidden phenomenon by its outward observation, and all this with various sources of noise and error. Therefore we must be cautious in castigating MRI as being especially suspect relative to other methods.</p><p>In support of the continued use and confidence in MRI is the reminder that most neuro-imagers have been aware of the statistical liabilities related to the method and have been working to address known sources of statistical error with the development of different <em>a priori </em>assumptions on the brain and MR technology, as well as the application of different tests to account for trade-offs in assessing imaging output. The degree of failure uncovered highlights the increased need for caution, more data, more extensive consultation with other sub-fields of neuroscience, and further development of acquisition and analytical tools. This last route in particular provides us with an opportunity to go beyond protocol in our methodology and toy with creative solutions. Using new tools or introducing new assumptions necessarily introduces new potential sources of failure, but this is a cost that must be assumed for the sake of progress. Interestingly, the opposite has been offered as a solution as well: that is, fMRI researchers should use set, standardized methods for analyses. However, that relegates scientists to the safety zone, or to the role of technician as defined by Carl Sagan.</p><p>Another general point to make about fMRI or any other scientific endeavor is that it is difficult, it is iterative, and thus failure should be expected. All these features relate to the novelty inherent to research. The hunch and some luck can go a way towards minimizing the time it takes to answer a research question, but deadlines do not serve scientific success. Because we cannot force luck or accelerate the research process to meet contractual, academic, professional or funding deadlines, the pressure to cut corners exists. Papers and results are published, as the profession requires, but the demand for quantity outstrips their quality. This point has also been raised in the past. Here’s a thought experiment: what if there were no time constraints on research? What if, upon obtaining degrees, scientists could simply work for a salary and be provided with operating costs to perform research during their professional lives? The point above touches on a potential shift in how we view work, time and compensation in general — but that particular argument is beyond the scope of this piece. What we can call on here is for senior researchers to alter the hierarchical system of research and consider that raising the bar for scientific quality while not lowering it for quantity is unsustainable.</p><p>In the end, fMRI is an amazing piece of technology. A painless, non-invasive method capable of tracking (albeit with some drag) neural activity on <em>and in</em> human brains, while the latter are awake and well, with near immediate results. Hopefully, it will be replaced with faster, better, cheaper technology, in the near future but for now the method is peerless. The onus falls on 1) fMRI researchers to challenge themselves on how best to deploy it; to refrain from viewing it as a few-click solution and accept that there is no free lunch — we have to keep developing tools to increase signal-to-noise, control for artifacts, lower false positives. Our tasks, assumptions and analytical designs must be prepared with more thought, time and input from other research areas, and we must share data to output high quality results. 2) We must simultaneously seek solidarity within the wider community — first from our very own senior researchers, the latter whom may admonish junior scientists on data analysis methods today, but have perhaps benefitted from formerly lax thresholds for publication and who currently have more scientific capital than younger scientists to challenge the status quo. 3) We must also entreat funding agencies to provide us with more time: behavioral scientists are aware of a speed-accuracy trade-off in tasks — why would it be different in research? 4) We can and should challenge the current paradigm of science as an individual competitive sport; research questions abound, especially in the neurosciences, thus there is plenty of work for generations of inquiring minds. 5) Finally, accepting that any method of choice in neuroscientific study is just a tool would go a long way in untangling our willful misunderstanding of each other’s languages. In the end we are all studying brains and their functions; to remain monolingual, so-to-speak, is a parochial pigeonholing whose end result is creative poverty. Making use of findings obtained in other fields — not just in a cursory manner to support our data but also with the aim of sharpening our initial hypotheses — would contribute to the field as well as support a sense of inclusiveness necessary for the field to advance.</p><p><em>Leyla Loued-Khenissi is a doctoral student at EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the winner of the Science Writing Competiton at the 2016 Human Brain Project Summit.

<p>If you’re in need of some renewed faith in human nature, the research literature on altruism by toddlers is a great place to look. Charming studies have shown that little children will readily <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/03/16/chimps-and-toddlers-lend-a-helping-hand/">go out of their way to help you</a>, such as picking up things you’ve dropped, or passing you stuff you can’t reach. They can even do “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/12/its-possible-to-be-patronised-by-a-helpful-three-year-old/">paternalistic helping</a>” which is when they ignore your specific request to help you in a way that you’ll find even more beneficial.</p>
<p>There are some evolutionarily tinged theoretical explanations for why children have these instincts: we’re a highly social species so it makes sense that we’re naturally inclined to help each other as a way to gain status and receive reciprocal favours later. A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/53/1/100/">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em> has taken a slightly different approach, asking: what is it, in the moment, that motivates toddlers to help others? Robert Hepach and his colleagues, including Michael Tomasello who’s conducted a lot of the landmark work on the development of altruism, report that toddlers are helpful, at least in part, because, well, they enjoy it. In fact, based on a new body-language measure of their emotion, they seem to find helping someone else about as pleasurable as they find helping themselves.</p>
<p><span id="more-18946"></span></p>
<p>The researchers conducted two similar studies that involved testing nearly 100 two-year-olds (their median age was 30 months), one at a time. The basic setting was that there was some fun apparatus for rolling wooden marbles down a tube. When the toddlers ran out of marbles, a researcher who had been hanging washing, got a box down from the windowsill and struggled with another adult to get the lid off. The toddler was asked to help, and when he or she lifted the lid off the box, she found either a piece of plastic that was good for nothing (a control condition), another wooden marble (helpful for them), or a clothes peg (helpful for the clothes-hanging researcher). This was repeated a few times with the contents of the box varying on each trial.</p>
<p>Whenever the toddlers went over to the researcher to show them what they’d found, their posture was filmed via Microsoft’s Kinetic body-motion capture system (the same one used for playing video games), and later other researchers also coded footage of the toddlers based on how smiley they were and their general emotional display.</p>
<p>The main heart-warming finding is that, in terms of body language, the toddlers showed a similar elevation of their posture (chest raised, a bit like an adult display of pride) whether they’d obtained an item that was helpful for themselves or helpful for the researcher, and much more so than when they found the useless piece of plastic. Their all round emotional display, as rated by independent observers, was also similarly more positive whether they’d found an item helpful to themselves or to the researcher (as compared with the control condition), except in one of the studies they did smile more when they found a marble than when they found a clothes peg.</p>
<p>The kind of positive emotions experienced by the children might have been different when helping themselves compared with helping others. But ultimately, the researchers said the “results suggest that for young children, working for themselves and helping others are similarly rewarding,” adding “positive emotions likely provide intrinsic rewards that reinforce prosocial behaviour toward those who are dependent on our help.”</p>
<p>The results are all the more impressive if you consider that when the toddlers discovered a clothes peg, they had to deal with the disappointment of knowing that they hadn’t found a marble to drop down the tube. But based on their raised posture and all-round emotional display, the pleasure of finding something useful for someone else seemed to easily outweigh this disappointment.</p>
<p>One caveat to bear in mind is that the children hadn’t decided to help another person, rather they came upon an item that was helpful to another, so their pleasure was at this discovery. We need more research to see if they exhibit similar pleasure in choosing to help others, as compared with choosing to help themselves. For now though, let’s just turn off the daily news for a minute and bask in this study’s warm message – it seems humans are born kind.</p>

<p>The luxury microwave meal was delicious, the house is warm, work’s going OK, but you’re just not feeling very happy. Some positive psychologists believe this is because many of us in rich, Western countries spend too much of our free time on passive activities, like bingeing on Netflix and browsing Twitter, rather than on active, psychologically demanding activities, like cooking, sports or playing music, that allow the opportunity to experience “flow” – that magic juncture where your abilities only just meet the demands of the challenge. A new <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2017.1279209?journalCode=rpos20">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em> examines this dilemma. Do we realise that pursuing more active, challenging activities will make us happier in the long-run? If so, why then do we opt to spend so much more time lazing around engaged in activities that are pleasant in the moment, but unlikely to bring any lasting fulfilment?</p>
<p><span id="more-18870"></span></p>
<p>Across two studies, L. Parker Schiffer and Tomi-Ann Roberts at the Claremont Graduate University and Colorado College, surveyed nearly 300 people (presumably US citizens, average age 33/34 years) via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website about what they thought of dozens of different activities: some passive like listening to music or watching movies, others more active and potentially flow-inducing, such as making art or meditating. Specifically, the participants rated how enjoyable, effortful, and daunting they considered the activities to be, as well as how often they engaged in each of them in a typical week. The participants also identified which activities they considered the most and least conducive to lasting happiness.</p>
<p>There was a clear pattern in the participants’ answers: they identified more effortful activities as being more associated with lasting happiness, yet they said they spent much more time on passive, relaxation-based activities, like watching TV. Looking at their other judgments, the key factor that seemed to deter participants from engaging in more active, flow-inducing activities is that they tended to be seen as particularly daunting and less enjoyable, even while being associated with lasting happiness. The more daunting an activity was deemed to be, the less frequently it was undertaken (by contrast, and to the researchers’ surprise, the perceived effort involved in the activity did not seem to be a deterrent).</p>
<p>Schiffer and Roberts consider this to be a paradox of happiness: we know which kind of activities will bring us lasting happiness, but because we see them as daunting and less enjoyable in the moment, we choose to spend much more of our time doing passive, more immediately pleasant things with our free time. Their advice is to plan ahead “to try to ease the physical transition into flow activities” to make them feel less daunting. For example, they suggest getting your gym clothes and bag ready the night before, and choosing a gym that’s close and convenient; or getting your journal and pen, or easel and paintbrushes, ready in advance.</p>
<p>The other thing they suggest is using mindfulness, meditation or some other “controlled consciousness” technique to help yourself to disregard the initial “transition costs” of a flow activity, such as the early pain of a run, and to focus instead on its pleasurable aspects and the long-term rewards.</p>
<p>“Future research is needed in order to empirically back our proposal that preplanning, prearranging, and, and controlled consciousness may aid overcoming the activation energy and transition costs that stand in the way of our true happiness,” the researchers said.</p>
