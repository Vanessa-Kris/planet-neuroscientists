                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/battery-free-game-boy-solar-panels-button-smashes">A Game Boy look-alike runs on solar panels and button smashes</a></h4>

<p>For a Game Boy doppelgänger, “batteries not included” is a perk, not a problem.</p>



<p>The prototype handheld game console, built by researchers at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, harvests enough energy from key smashing and sunlight to run games like <em>Tetris</em> and <em>Super Mario Land</em>.</p>



<p>Such <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411839">a battery-free setup</a>, presented September 15 at the virtual UbiComp conference, could one day help curb <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/annual-e-waste-electronics-recycling-75-million-metric-tons">electronic waste</a> from handheld games and other mobile devices (<em>SN: 7/2/20</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re reimagining what the Game Boy did,” but with more sustainable technology, says Northwestern computer engineer and longtime gamer Josiah Hester.</p>





<p>Hester and colleagues built their device from scratch, rather than repurposing an existing Game Boy, because the original console used too much power to easily go battery-free. “It was about five to 10 times more power hungry than the hardware we’re running,” Hester says.</p>





<p>The heart of the team’s Game Boy look-alike is a small, low-power microcontroller “running a program that pretends to be a Game Boy,” he says. In other words, the computing hardware reads retro game-cartridge instructions. Solar panels on the front of the device collect energy from sunlight. And each button contains a small magnet that, when pressed down or released, moves through a wire coil underneath the button. That change in the magnetic field around the coil generates an electric current that also can be used to power the device.</p>



<p>Some games are better supported by button-pressing energy than others. “It’s pretty hard to put <em>Pokémon</em> on this because you don’t really press buttons a lot — it’s more thoughtful,” Hester says, whereas games like <em>Tetris</em> can involve some pretty frantic button pressing.</p>



<p>In well-lit environments, the battery-free console can collect enough power to sustain about 10 seconds of play before it dies for a second and reboots. Unlike the original Game Boy, the new console’s memory allows games to resume play at the exact same spot after a power interruption. To make user-generated energy more practical, Hester and colleagues are exploring other means of harvesting energy on the go, including through shaking, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry">heat or friction</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-beam-space-moon-dust-zap-clean-up">How do you clean up clingy space dust? Zap it with an electron beam</a></h4>

<p>The NASA Artemis missions aim to send astronauts to the moon by 2024. But to succeed, they’ll need to solve big problems caused by some tiny particles: dust.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-craters-suggest-earth-preserves-past-asteroid-impacts">Impacts on the moon’s surface</a> have crushed lunar rock into dust over billions of years (<em>SN: 1/17/19</em>). The resulting particles are like “broken shards of glass,” says Mihály Horányi, a physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder. This abrasive material can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-wears-dusty-cloak">damage equipment</a> and even harm astronauts’ health if inhaled (<em>SN: 12/3/13</em>). Making matters worse, the sun’s radiation gives moon dust an electric charge, so it sticks to everything.</p>



<p>Horányi and colleagues have discovered a new method for combatting lunar dust’s static cling, using a low-powered electron beam to make <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576520304902">dust particles fly off surfaces</a>. It complements existing approaches to the sticky problem, the researchers report online August 8 in <em>Acta Astronautica.</em></p>







<p>During the Apollo missions, astronauts relied on a low-tech system to clean lunar dust off their spacesuits: <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/dust-brush-apollo/nasm_A19750064000">brushes</a>. Such mechanical methods, however, are thwarted by the electrically charged nature of lunar dust, which clings to the nooks and crannies of woven spacesuit fabric.</p>



<p>The newly described method takes advantage of the dust’s electrical properties. An electron beam causes dust to release electrons into the tiny spaces between particles. Some of these negatively charged electrons are absorbed by surrounding dust specks. Because the charged particles repel each other, the resulting electric field “ejects dust off the surface,” says Xu Wang, a physicist also at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Abrasive, electrically charged lunar dust clings to surfaces and could wreak havoc on equipment and astronaut well-being during missions to the moon. An electron beam may aid future cleaning efforts. As shown here, when a beam hits artificial lunar dust on a glass plate, particles leap off the surface.</figure>



<p>“This is a very unique idea,” says mechanical engineer Hiroyuki Kawamoto of Waseda University in Tokyo, who was not involved in the new work. Kawamoto and colleagues have developed their own dust-busting technologies, including a layer of electrodes that can be built into materials. When embedded in a spacesuit or on the surface of equipment, the electrodes generate electrostatic forces and fling away charged dust particles. Such systems are more complex than shooting an electron beam at surfaces, Wang says. But a potential downside to the simpler electric beam idea, Kawamoto says, is that it would require a robot or some other external means to direct it.</p>



<p>Another limitation of the electron beam is that it left behind 15 to 25 percent of dust particles. The researchers aim to improve the cleaning power. The team also envisions the electron beam as one of multiple approaches that future space explorers will take to keep surfaces clean, Horányi says, in addition to suit design, other cleaning technologies and, one day, even lunar habitats with moon dust mudrooms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/15/which-human-experiences-are-universal/">Which Human Experiences Are Universal?</a></h4>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>As everyone knows, American undergrads are not representative of all humanity — and the perils of drawing conclusions about people in general from <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird">WEIRD studies</a> have been well-publicised. To really understand which human experiences are universal, and which are a product of our individual cultures, we need big, well-conducted studies of people from many different cultures. Fortunately, there are studies like this. Here are some of their most fascinating insights…</p>


<p><span id="more-40304"></span></p>


<p><strong>Personal space</strong></p>



<p>How big is your “personal space”? As a Brit, I’d expect mine to be larger than that of the average Italian’s, say. That’s because I know there are studies finding that people living in cultures that favour physical contact tend to have smaller “personal bubbles”. However, until recently, decent cross-cultural analyses of this concept had been lacking. </p>



<p>That changed with a 2017 paper on “Preferred interpersonal distances” in the <a href="https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/873645.sorokowska_et_al_2017.pdf"><em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em></a> from authors representing a total of 59 institutions, based everywhere from Beijing to Uruguay to Iran. In total, the team, led by Agnieszka Sorokowska, collected data on almost 9000 participants from 42 countries. They looked at preferences for “social distance” (physical distance when interacting with a stranger), “personal distance” (when with an acquaintance), and “intimate distance” (when interacting with a family member, for example). </p>



<p>There were positive correlations between all three measures, but especially between the first two: people who preferred to stand closer to a stranger also tended to like being closer to an acquaintance. And when it came to country-by-country variations, the team found some big differences. People in Argentina had the smallest bubbles: they were happy for acquaintances to get within about 60 cm, and allowed close friends and family about another 15 cm nearer. England and the US fell about a third of the way up the acceptable distance chart — people in England preferred acquaintances to stay about 20 cm further away than Argentinians did, for example. The list was topped, though, by Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The average Hungarian’s preferred personal distance was almost <em>twice</em> that of the average Argentinian’s.</p>



<p>Exactly what might drive these country differences isn’t clear. But the team did note that, on the whole, women, older people and residents of colder countries preferred to keep strangers further at bay. Right now, however, Covid-19 means that of course we’re all used to more personal space than normal. But fear of the virus, along with long, stressful periods in lockdown, have led to a doubling in the personal distances perceived as comfortable among people in Lombardy, the region of Italy most affected by the virus, according to Tina Iachini at the University of Campania. “Social distance is like an invisible buffer around us that we always carry,” <a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-05-03/COVID-19-means-we-all-want-more-personal-space-Q9hylaKKcg/index.html">she’s been quoted as saying</a>. “It is our shield of safety and that is why we are so sensitive to the safety value of this space.”</p>



<p><strong>Emotion terms  </strong></p>



<p>What does “anger” or “happiness” mean to you? And do these, and other emotion labels, mean essentially the same thing to an English-speaker as their nearest translations do to people who speak other languages? </p>



<p>Earlier this year, a team led by Joshua Conrad Jackson at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">paper in <em>Science</em></a> that looked for variations in the meaning of 24 emotional concepts across 2474 languages. The team examined the pattern of “colexification” in the different languages: that is, the way that single words are used to describe multiple concepts. For instance, in Persian, <em>ænduh</em> means both grief and regret, while in the Dargwa dialect, spoken in Dagestan in Russia, <em>dard</em> means grief and anxiety. So speakers of the two languages might have slightly different understandings of what “grief” is.</p>



<p>The team found important variations between language families. For example, in some languages, “anger” was related to “envy”, whereas in others it was linked more with “hate” or “proud”. In some Austronesian languages, “pity” and “love” were associated, whereas in others, they were not. (In general, though, there was agreement about which emotions are “positive” and which are “negative”.) The work suggests that there are indeed shades of culturally-influenced emotional experience. </p>



<p><strong>Sensory perceptions</strong></p>



<p>The octave system is not only intrinsic to Western music, it’s also mathematically-based: move up an octave, and a given note doubles in frequency. Perhaps, then, Western music has come to use this system because it relates to the way that sound waves physically stimulate the cochlea in our inner ear — in other words, there’s something biologically fundamental, and universal, about the way we perceive pitch. </p>



<p>The problem with this suggestion is that, until recently, researchers hadn’t tested the musical perceptions of people who had not been exposed to Western music. In 2019, that changed. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096098221931036X">paper in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, a team led by Nori Jacoby at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics revealed that a remote group of people living in the Bolivian rainforest don’t process pitch in the same way as Americans. Unlike those of us used to listening to Western music, these people don’t perceive similarities between two notes occurring an octave apart. </p>



<p>This work adds to other research, notably in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/18335">vision</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/13/studies-of-se-asian-tribes-force-a-re-think-on-the-psychology-of-language-and-smell/">smell</a>, revealing that, while of course we humans all possess the same hardware, culture influences our sensory perceptions. </p>



<p><strong>Mate preferences</strong></p>



<p>Back in 1989, the American psychologist David Buss published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889">an influential paper</a> concluding that there are some clear gender differences in mate preferences. Based on a study of data from more than 10,000 participants from 37 different cultures, he and his team suggested that women tend to be more interested in “good financial prospects” than men, and that men, more than women, consider “good looks” to be important in a mate. Cue a heated debate, and all kinds of follow-up studies. The big question was this: if these differences indeed exist, are they driven by biology, or by culture — and specifically by gender inequality? In cultures with markedly greater gender equality, might these differences disappear? </p>



<p>In 2020, against a backdrop of old data and conflicting methods and conclusions, a huge international team, led by Kathryn Walter at the University of Santa Barbara, published a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620904154?journalCode=pssa">large-scale replication study</a> on more than 14,000 participants across 45 countries. Across groups, men were more interested in physical attractiveness than women, who in turn preferred older mates with good financial prospects. In countries with greater gender equality, couples tended to be more closely matched in age, but beyond this, levels of gender equality did not have an impact. The researchers concluded: “Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust.”</p>



<p><strong>Human values </strong></p>



<p>Do we all fundamentally value the same things? And do these values vary at all with age — or between genders? </p>



<p>These are more than theoretically important questions. As the team behind a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recent paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> led by Paul Hanel (Cardiff University) note, immigration is triggering some conflicts over perceptions of value. For example, a 2016 poll reported that three quarters of people living in Ontario, Canada, felt that <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/07/04/ontario-facing-epidemic-of-islamophobia-survey-finds.html">Muslim immigrants have fundamentally different values to their own</a>. </p>



<p>However, other surveys have found that people around the world agree on values. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022101032003002">one study</a> by Shalom Schwartz and Anat Bardi, people from 50 different countries tended to agree that benevolence, universalism and self-direction are highly important; tradition and power were valued least. </p>



<p>So what can explain these discrepancies? Hanel and his colleagues <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recently studied</a> people living in three different cultures: Brazil, India and the UK. They concluded that people in different nations can differ in the behaviours associated with certain values, while still holding similar ideas about the meaning and importance of those values. </p>



<p>In 2020, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-16473-001">separate team led by Roosevelt Vilar</a> looked at age and gender differences in values among more than 20,000 people living across 20 countries with “substantial” cultural variability. They found slight differences between men and women through most life stages. In general, women were more focused on social and ‘central’ goals (helping others, for example) whereas men were more focused on personal goals (excitement and promotion). Older people, too, valued social and central goals more than younger people, who were more enamoured of personal goals. </p>



<p>However, the team reports, culture had virtually no impact on the results. This, they argue, “supports the lifespan developmental psychological idea that values reflect a universal pattern of human agency in facing challenges over the life span”.</p>



<p>Broadly, then, this study, at least, argues that we are all driven to have fundamentally the same values — and the same slightly diverging values, according to age and gender — no matter where we live in the world.</p>



<p>While all these studies help us to understand which aspects of the human experience are universal, they don’t actually fix the WEIRD problem, of course. What we really need are for researchers to include non-WEIRD participants in studies as <em>standard</em>. But while this should make results more generalisable, clearly there could also be situations in which there <em>are</em> meaningful differences in results between cultures — and these should be appreciated, too.</p>

<p>New closeup views of lung cells show just how prolifically the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can replicate once it infiltrates the respiratory tract. </p>



<p>In the lab, pediatric pulmonologist Camille Ehre and colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill infected cells that line the airways in the lungs with SARS-CoV-2, waited 96 hours and then snapped scanning electron micrograph images of the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2023328">virus-laden cells</a>.</p>



<p>“Once a cell is infected, it is completely taken over by the virus, producing an astonishing number of viruses,” Ehre says. In a lab dish of about 1 million human cells, she says the viral load can skyrocket from about one thousand infectious viruses to 10 million in just two days. The new images were published September 3 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>

<p>Cells that line the respiratory tract and their hairlike protrusions called cilia help clear airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. These types of cells are also specifically targeted by the coronavirus. Once infected, they churn out “astronomical numbers” of viral particles, Ehre says, potentially propelling the particles deeper into the lungs, which can cause pneumonia, or out into the air where they can infect others.</p>



<p>“These images of airway cells jam-packed with viruses make a strong case for the use of masks to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission whether an individual has symptoms or not,” Ehre says. Widespread mask wearing could help contain such explosive viral replication from spreading beyond a single individual.</p>

<p>To record the activity from a  population of neurons, calcium imaging and extracellular recordings with small electrodes are the two most widely used methods that are still  able to disentangle the contributions from single units. Here, I would like to briefly mention two papers that try to connect these two approaches by comparing them more or less directly.</p>



<ol><li>Wei et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1">A comparison of neuronal population dynamics measured with calcium imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2019<br /></li><li>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244723v1">Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with two-photon imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2020<br /></li></ol>



<p>Both papers compare calcium imaging datasets and extracellular ephys datasets, try to connect the results and point out the difficulties in reconciling the approaches.</p>



<p><strong>Wei et al. </strong>use datasets recorded in mouse anterio-lateral motor cortex (ALM). They first focus on approaches to reconstruct spike rates from calcium imaging data (deconvolution) and find several limitations of this approach. On the other hand, they find that a forward model that transforms spiking activity to calcium fluorescence data can reconcile most of these differences.</p>



<p>The authors also provide a user-friendly website which can be used to explore the transformations between ephys and imaging data (also including datasets with simultaneous ephys-imaging): <a href="http://im-phys.org">http://im-phys.org</a>. (Understanding the figures of the paper is however quite useful before exploring the website.)</p>

<p>A large part of the paper focuses on high-level analyses (principal component analysis, decoding of behavior and decision). I would take it as an educational tale of caution which highlights wrong conclusions that could be made based on standard analyses. For example, the slow and variable decay times of calcium imaging data can lead to a dispersion of peak activity that was absent in the ephys data. This dispersion can smear out clearly timed activations of neuronal population into something more similar to a sequence (see Figure 7, of which I have pasted an excerpt above).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</strong> from the Allen Institute, rather than investigating the effects on higher-level population analyses, focus their attention on the effects seen in single neurons. When comparing a calcium imaging and an ephys dataset recorded in the same brain region (visual cortex V1) in mice that do the same standardized tasks, what differences can be seen in the firing properties of single neurons?</p>



<p>Due to the high standardization requirements at the Allen Institute, their datasets are probably uniquely qualified to be the basis for such a comparison. Interestingly, they find a couple of clear differences. For example, extracellular ephys data suggest typical firing rates of around 3 Hz (see Figure 2A), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than what has been recorded and estimated from calcium imaging data (see also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Figure 7 in our preprint</a>, which estimates spike rates of the same dataset).</p>



<p>The authors go to great lengths to use forward transformations (similar to Wei et al.) in order to reconcile differences seen for various response metrics (responsiveness, tuning preference, selectivity). However, their conclusion seemed to me quite a bit less optimistic compared to the Wei et al. paper. The authors go into more detail when discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancies, and focus on the recording methods themselves rather than on methods to transform between them. In particular their analysis of inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations in ephys recordings (which indicate that spikes from different neurons contaminate the recording of the neuron of interest) was, in my opinion, particularly interesting and convincing. I also really recommend to anybody the last paragraph of their discussion, from which I only want to cite their note of caution about extracellular ephys recordings:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From this study, we have learned that extracellular electrophysiology overestimates the fraction of neurons that elevate their activity in response to visual stimuli, in a manner that is consistent with the effects of selection bias and contamination. – Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</p></blockquote>



<p>One of the reasons why I am writing about these two studies is that I have been working at the interface of calcium imaging and ephys myself, addressing the question, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">How much information about spike rates can we get out of calcium imaging data?</a> Wei et al. and Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al. take a slightly broader perspective. And, in some way, they show how hard it is to reconcile two (methodological) perspectives on the same phenomenon. (I noticed this in my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a> as well, when it came to reconciling results from EM reconstructions of neuronal anatomy and calcium measurements of the same neurons.) Since almost any method in systems neuroscience is technically challenging, we often have in a single lab only a single perspective of a phenomenon, and I think it’s important to always be aware that the conclusions drawn from this perspective might be strongly biased.</p>



<p>In general, calcium imaging and extracellular ephys are extremely valuable tools to observe the living brain, and we better do anything to understand the properties and limitations of these tools. These studies sometimes might feel a bit like negative results and therefore not very attractive to those who want to advance neuroscience, and I therefore understand why not many are willing to undertake these projects. So I am glad to be able to highlight these two publications here.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">Phosphine gas found in Venus’ atmosphere may be ‘a possible sign of life’</a></h4>

<p>Venus’ clouds appear to contain a smelly, toxic gas that could be produced by bacteria, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Chemical signs of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4">the gas phosphine have been spotted</a> in observations of the Venusian atmosphere, researchers report September 14 in <em>Nature Astronomy.</em> Examining the atmosphere in millimeter wavelengths of light showed that the planet’s clouds appear to contain up to 20 parts per billion of phosphine — enough that something must be actively producing it, the researchers say. </p>



<p>If the discovery holds up, and if no other explanations for the gas are found, then the hellish planet next door could be the first to yield signs of extraterrestrial life — though those are very big ifs.</p>



<p>“We’re not saying it’s life,” says astronomer Jane Greaves of Cardiff University in Wales. “We’re saying it’s a possible sign of life.”</p>





<p>Venus has roughly the same mass and size as Earth, so, from far away, the neighboring planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">might look like a habitable world</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>). But up close, Venus is a scorching hellscape with sulfuric acid rain and crushing atmospheric pressures.</p>



<p>Still, Venus might have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-once-possibly-habitable-study-suggests">more hospitable in the recent past</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/16</em>). And the current harsh conditions haven’t stopped astrobiologists from speculating about niches on Venus where present-day life could hang on, such as the temperate cloud decks.</p>



<p>“Fifty kilometers above the surface of Venus, the conditions are what you would find if you walk out of your door right now,” at least in terms of atmospheric pressure and temperature, says planetary scientist Sanjay Limaye of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the new study. The chemistry is alien, but “that’s a hospitable environment for life.”</p>



<p>Previous work led by astrochemist Clara Sousa-Silva at MIT suggested that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2018.1954">phosphine could be a promising biosignature</a>, a chemical signature of life that can be detected in the atmospheres of other planets using Earth-based or space telescopes.</p>



<p>On Earth, phosphine is associated with microbes or industrial activity — although that doesn’t mean it’s pleasant. “It’s a horrific molecule. It’s terrifying,” Sousa-Silva says. For most Earthly life, phosphine is poisonous because “it interferes with oxygen metabolism in a variety of macabre ways.” For anaerobic life, which does not use oxygen, “phosphine is not so evil,” Sousa-Silva says. Anaerobic microbes living in such places as sewage, swamps and the intestinal tracts of animals from penguins to people are the only known life-forms on Earth that produce the molecule.  </p>



<p>Still, when Greaves and colleagues searched Venus’ skies for signs of phosphine, the researchers didn’t expect to actually find any. Greaves looked at Venus with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii over five mornings in June 2017, aiming to set a detectability benchmark for future studies seeking the gas in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-hydrogen-rich-atmosphere-alien-life">atmospheres of exoplanets</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/20</em>), but was startled to find the hints of phosphine. “That’s a complete surprise,” Greaves says. When she was analyzing the observations, “I thought ‘Oh, I must have done it wrong.’”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="James Clerk Maxwell Telescope" class="wp-image-3091384" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/091120_lg_venus_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091384">Signs of phosphine first showed up in data taken with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091384">Will Montgomerie/JCMT/EAO</span></figure>



<p>So the team checked again with a more powerful telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile, in March 2019. But the signature of phosphine — seen as a dip in the spectrum of light at about 1.12 millimeters — was still there. The gas absorbs light in that wavelength. Some other molecules also absorb light near that wavelength, but those either couldn’t explain the whole signal or seemed improbable, Greaves says. “One of those is a plastic,” she says. “I think a floating plastic factory is a less plausible explanation than just saying there’s phosphine.”</p>



<p>Phosphine takes a fair amount of energy to create and is easily destroyed by sunlight or sulfuric acid, which is found in Venus’ atmosphere. So if the gas was produced a long time ago, it shouldn’t still be detectable. “There has to be a source,” Greaves says.</p>



<p>Greaves, Sousa-Silva and colleagues considered every explanation they could think of apart from life: atmospheric chemistry; ground and subsurface chemistry; volcanoes outgassing phosphine from the Venusian interior; meteorites peppering the atmosphere with phosphine from the outside; lightning; solar wind; tectonic plates sliding against each other. Some of those processes could produce trace amounts of phosphine, the team found, but orders of magnitude less than the team detected.</p>



<p>“We’re at the end of our rope,” Sousa-Silva says. She hopes other scientists will come up with other explanations. “I’m curious what kind of exotic geochemistry people will come up with to explain this abiotically.”</p>



<p>The idea of searching for life on Venus “has been regarded as a pretty out-there concept,” says Planetary Science Institute astrobiologist David Grinspoon, who is based in Washington, D.C. Grinspoon has been publishing about the prospects for life on Venus since 1997, but was not involved in the new discovery.</p>



<p>“So now I hear about this, and I’m delighted,” he says. “Not because I want to declare victory and say this is definite evidence of life on Venus. It’s not. But it’s an intriguing signature that could be a sign of life on Venus. And it obligates us to go investigate further.”</p>



<p>Because of the planet’s acidic atmosphere, extreme pressures and lead-melting temperatures, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">sending spacecraft to Venus</a> is a challenge (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>). But several space agencies are considering missions that could fly in the next few decades.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Greaves and colleagues want to confirm the new phosphine detection in other wavelengths of light. Observations they had planned for the spring were put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic. And now, Venus is in a part of its orbit where it’s on the other side of the sun.</p>



<p>“Maybe when Venus comes around on the other side of the sun again,” Greaves says, “things will be better for us here on Earth.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-rarest-diamonds-form-primordial-carbon-mantle">Earth’s rarest diamonds form from primordial carbon in the mantle</a></h4>

<p>Most diamonds are made of carbon recycled over and over again between Earth’s surface and its crust. But diamonds with the deepest origins — such as the famed Hope Diamond — are made of carbon from a separate source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2676-z">a newly discovered, ancient reservoir</a> hidden in Earth’s lower mantle, scientists report Sept. 10 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Chemical clues within these superdeep diamonds suggest that there’s a previously unknown limit to how deep Earth’s carbon cycle goes. Understanding this part of the carbon cycle — how and where carbon moves in and out of the planet’s interior — can help scientists understand changes to the planet’s climate over eons, the researchers say. </p>



<p>Diamonds form at different depths before making their way to the surface where they are unearthed. “Most of the diamonds people are familiar with are from the upper 250 kilometers of the planet,” says Margo Regier, a geochemist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. “Superdeep” diamonds are from at least 250 kilometers underground, and “they’re really quite rare,” Regier says. But rarest of all are diamonds that form as far as 700 kilometers down, within the lower mantle.</p>



<p>“Often those are some of the biggest you find, like the Hope Diamond,” Regier says. These deepest, highly prized diamonds are also priceless scientifically, offering a rare window into the lower mantle. For example, tiny imperfections preserved in some of the diamonds contain geologic treasures: the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamonds-reveal-sign-deepest-water-known-inside-earth">deepest form of water known inside Earth</a>, or even some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fluid-superdeep-diamonds-may-be-some-earths-oldest-unchanged-material">oldest preserved material on the planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/18</em>; <em>SN: 8/15/19</em>).</p>





<p>The source of the carbon in these deepest diamonds has been a mystery, but scientists wondered whether it came from the subduction of Earth’s tectonic plates. As one plate slides beneath another and sinks into the mantle, it transports carbon from the surface to the interior, a key part of the carbon cycle. Some of the carbon eventually returns to the surface, via erupting volcanoes or as diamonds, while some gets sequestered away in the deep crust or upper mantle. Carbon sequestration by subduction may have played a key role in creating space for oxygen to accumulate in Earth’s atmosphere, paving the way for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-flooded-earths-atmosphere-earlier-thought">Great Oxidation Event</a> about 2.3 billion years ago (<em>SN: 2/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>Diamonds and their inclusions — tiny slivers of rock that become embedded in the crystal structures as the diamonds form — provide sparkling clues to the environments in which they formed. So Regier and colleagues examined diamonds that formed in the crust, upper mantle and lower mantle, hunting for the chemical traces of subducted crust. To do this, the team analyzed isotopes — different forms of an element — of carbon and nitrogen in the diamonds, as well as isotopes of oxygen in the inclusions.</p>



<p>The relative amounts of these elemental forms indicate the chemical makeup of the magma in which the diamonds crystallized. For example, diamonds that formed in the crust and upper mantle had inclusions enriched in oxygen-18 — suggesting that the gemstones crystallized out of magma formed from subducted oceanic crust.</p>



<p>“All the isotopes tell the same story in a different way,” Regier says. “The carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, they’re all saying that subducting slabs are able to transport carbon and similar elements to a similar depth in the mantle. But at around 500 to 600 kilometers deep, most of that carbon is lost through magma” that rises back to the surface, she says. “After that, the slabs are relatively depleted in carbon.”</p>



<p>The chemical makeup of diamonds from deeper than 660 kilometers was markedly different from that of the shallower diamonds. Those “form in a different way, from carbon already stored within the mantle,” Regier says. “The very deepest samples must have been [made of] primordial carbon that never escaped from the planet.”</p>



<p>The finding also suggests a limit to how deeply carbon from the surface can be buried within the planet’s interior. One implication of this, Regier says, is that it calls into question whether subduction was able to bury carbon deeply and for long enough to be a driving force behind the Great Oxidation Event.</p>



<p>But subducting slabs don’t need to carry carbon all the way to the lower mantle to sequester it, or to have a profound impact on Earth’s climate, says Megan Duncan, a petrologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. “The carbon doesn’t need to make it that far down,” Duncan says. “It just needs to be removed from the surface to have that oxygen-rise effect.”</p>



<p>The link between subduction and the rise of oxygen on the ancient Earth is still an open question, Regier acknowledges. “Earth is complex … [and] the fact that we have samples that tell us about this carbon cycle deep in the planet is exciting,” she adds. “It says that there’s a lot we don’t understand about our planet.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>When Usain Bolt or Serena Williams step out for their latest race or match, the world waits with bated breath. As some of the best athletes in the world, their unbelievable winning streaks have been met by almost universal acclaim — and plenty of people hoping that streak isn’t broken.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-59201-001">according to</a> Jesse Walker from Ohio State University and Thomas Gilovich from Cornell University, that investment and goodwill just isn’t the same when it comes to teams: we’re far less impressed by consecutive wins by groups of people than those by individuals. They call this phenomenon the “Streaking Star Effect” in their new paper in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.  </p>


<p><span id="more-40296"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 207 participants read about the history and rules of Calcio Fiorentino, an obscure amateur Italian sport combining aspects of football, rugby and martial arts. Participants in the “team” condition were told the Milan team were the best in the world, winning six championships in a row; those in the “individual” condition read about Robert Moretti, the best player in the world, on the same streak. They then rated how much they would be rooting for either Milan or Moretti to win the championship and how much they would want the streak to come to an end.</p>



<p>Participants wanted to see Roberto Moretti continue his winning streak significantly more than they wanted the Milan team to do the same. Given that participants were American, they likely were not familiar with either the game or Moretti, suggesting that the results couldn’t be explained by a desire to see a beloved figure succeed. </p>



<p>The same results held in a second study using the similarly obscure example of a British quizzing competition. A third, in which the pool of competitors was exactly the same size for individuals and teams, showed that the Streaking Star Effect couldn’t be explained by the fact individual participants were likely to have beaten more competitors than teams would have.</p>



<p>The fourth study looked more closely at the underlying causes of the Streaking Star Effect. A total of 205 participants read about the National Association of Police Organizations, which gives awards each year to both individual police officers and departments. In the individual condition, participants read about an award given to the best homicide detective in the USA, and were told that Edwin Sorenson had won the award four years in a row. Participants in the group condition read about an award for the best homicide department in the country, learning that either the Kansas City or Los Angeles Police Department had, again, won four years in a row.</p>



<p>As well as answering the questions from the first three studies, participants also indicated how much they would feel awe, amazement and wonder if either Sorenson’s or the police department’s streak were to continue. To distinguish awe from other positive emotions, participants also stated how happy, amused and compassionate they would feel.</p>



<p>Again, participants were significantly more keen to see the individual (Detective Sorenson) extend his winning streak than the team (the police department). Furthermore, participants felt more wonder at the prospect of Detective Sorenson’s continued success and more positive emotion overall, suggesting that feelings of awe can lead to a greater desire to see an individual winning streak continue.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were asked to explain why they felt either an individual or a team was on a winning streak. Success was more often chalked up to disposition or personal characteristics (rather than circumstances) for individuals than it was for teams. Greater dispositional attributions were also linked to increased feelings of awe. In other words, credit was given to an individual and their talents more than their situation, creating far more emotional attachment and investment than for team achievements, which tended to be attributed to circumstances.</p>



<p>A final study confirmed that the Streaking Star Effect holds even outside of sports: when a company’s success was attributed to an individual CEO, participants felt that the company deserved a greater market share than when it had been guided by a group of executives. This makes sense: companies like Microsoft and Apple have famously benefited from charismatic founders and CEOs, while those without a focus on an individual leader often hold less emotional resonance for the general public.</p>



<p>This final study hints at wider repercussions too, and in a follow-up survey the team found participants far less tolerant of wealth inequality when those at the top were described in group rather than individual terms: when <em>individuals</em> were perceived to be at the top, participants were more likely to believe they deserved it. Stretching beyond sport, the Streaking Star Effect may even, as Walker and Gilovich put it, change the way we think about “the rich and poor, the powerful and powerless”.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-treatments-target-nose-prevention">Treatments that target the coronavirus in the nose might help prevent COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>COVID-19 can ravage the body, targeting the lungs, heart and blood vessels. To curb this wide-ranging attack, scientists are focusing on another part of the body: the nose.</p>



<p>The virus that causes the illness, SARS-CoV-2, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-sense-smell-brain-nerve-cells">gains its foothold by infecting certain nasal cells</a>, studies suggest (<em>SN: 6/12/20</em>). As a result, the nose has emerged as a key battleground in the war against COVID-19. Slowing or stopping that nasal invasion might ultimately be powerful enough to change the course of the pandemic, some scientists suspect.</p>



<p>So far, no such therapies exist. But people who study the nose and its contents bring fresh perspectives about the early stages of COVID-19 infections. Scientists are developing and testing ways to prevent the virus from settling in to prime nasal real estate. These include a nose spray that smothers and inactivates a key viral protein, disinfectants that are commonly used before sinus surgeries, and even dilute baby shampoo misted up the nose.</p>

<p>“I’m a nose person,” says Andrew Lane, an otolaryngologist and rhinology specialist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. But to most people, noses don’t usually spark a lot of interest, he says. “Now it’s the center of people’s attention.”</p>



<p>This nasal gazing makes perfect sense. “The nose is a place where the virus is setting up shop,” Lane says. In a recent study, he and colleagues measured levels of a protein on human cells called ACE2 that’s thought to be one of the ways the virus can infect the cells. Among a collection of human tissues taken from the noses and throats of people, the upper back part of the nasal cavity, known as the olfactory epithelium, was packed with ACE2. (This spot is also where smell cells dwell; SARS-CoV-2 infections there have been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-symptoms-signs-loss-smell-taste">loss of smell</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>“You would just see this incredibly bright signal coming from the olfactory epithelium,” Lane says. That ACE2 signal suggests that those cells might be key entry ports that allow the virus to <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2020/07/23/13993003.01948-2020">move into the rest of the body</a>, and even perhaps back out again to infect other people, the researchers report in the Sept. 1 <em>European Respiratory Journal</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="nasal cavity cells" class="wp-image-3091321" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090920_ls_covid-nose_inline_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091321">In the upper, back part of a person’s nasal cavity, certain cells contain lots of ACE2 (red), a protein that can allow entry to the virus that causes COVID-19. Here, cells’ nuclei are shown in blue and olfactory nerve cells, which don’t seem to have ACE2, are green.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091321">Mengfei Chen</span></figure>



<p>To interrupt the infection in the nose, some scientists are turning to specialized immune proteins found in camels, llamas and alpacas. Called nanobodies, these proteins help fight off invaders in the body, but are smaller and thought to be hardier than their human antibody kin. In lab studies of proteins and cells in dishes, biochemist Aashish Manglik and cell biologist Peter Walter, both at the University of California, San Francisco, have shown that custom-designed nanobodies can smother the spike protein that the coronavirus can use to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells">break into cells</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers haven’t yet tested the nanobodies in people. But their preliminary results suggest that, once neutralized with nanobodies, the virus “cannot enter human cells,” Walter says. “It cannot establish that beachfront in the nasal cavity.” These nanobodies were stable when dried and aerosolized, the researchers found, suggesting that they could be made into a nose spray. The most recent <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.08.238469v2.full.pdf">results</a>, which haven’t been peer-reviewed, were posted August 17  at bioRxiv.org. The team hopes to begin tests in laboratory animals and eventually, in humans. Walter and Manglik hold patents on the specially designed nanobodies.</p>



<p>A simpler approach would be to wash away or kill the virus in the nose. Some doctors have begun looking at iodine — the basis of a common antiseptic that can treat wounds and disinfect skin before surgeries. In a June 10 review article in <em>Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Journal</em>, researchers <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0145561320932318">describe evidence</a> that suggests a dilute solution called povidone-iodine might safely eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavity and throat.</p>



<p>Early hints that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7300649/">this rinse might work</a> come from studies of the virus in lab dishes, including a paper published June 16 in the <em>Journal of Prosthodontics</em>. And a clinical trial is under way at the University of Kentucky in Lexington with health care workers using povidone-iodine <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04364802">nose sprays and gargles preventively</a> before, during and after shifts.</p>

<p>Other researchers are turning to an even more low-tech solution: a mixture of soap and salt. Saline rinses can remove bacteria and allergens from the nasal cavity and ease symptoms of allergies, sinus infections and colds. A current clinical trial is designed to look for effects of baby shampoo mixed with a salt solution on the symptoms and possible spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in people who have COVID-19. The soapy solution might be able to wash viruses out of the nose, or pop their protective outer layer and inactivate them, says Justin Turner, a nasal and sinus surgeon and rhinologist who is among the researchers running the trial at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</p>



<p>“We know that the virus is very sensitive to soaps and surfactants,” Turner says. Washing hands with soap, for example, is a good way to eliminate the coronavirus. “It seems like it could be reasonable to recommend that for the nose as well,” Turner says.</p>



<p>During the trial, COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms, but not sick enough to be hospitalized, will either do nothing special to their nose, rinse it with saline several times a day or rinse it with saline plus a small amount of baby shampoo. In the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04347538">clinical trial</a>, which began May 1, Turner and colleagues are tracking around 100 people’s symptoms and the amount of virus in their noses, a measurement that might indicate whether someone is more or less contagious. An early look at 45 patients shows that people who did the nose rinses, either saline alone or saline with soap, got rid of their headaches and nose congestion about a week earlier than the people who didn’t use rinses. Those <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alr.22703">interim results</a> appear online September 11 in the <em>International Forum of Allergy &amp; Rhinology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s possible that nose rinses might “stir up the virus and facilitate its spread,” Lane cautions. But the idea of a nose rinse holds promise, and is worth testing, he says. This work, and other studies that target the nose are gaining momentum. “Everybody is thinking the same way, and I think there’s a lot of merit to it,” Lane says. “Nip it in the bud, and stop it before it gets a hold.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Tinnitus-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Let’s be honest, when most of us attend or take part in noisy recreational activities (e.g., nightclubs, concerts, playing musical instruments, indoor/outdoor sporting activities, motorsports) the last thing we reach for are hearing protection devices (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs). This is despite the fact that these activities can often range in loudness levels over 100 dBA, with the potential to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html">cause hearing symptoms (e.g., dullness in hearing/tinnitus) after 15 minutes</a> of continuous exposure. This is one of the reasons why the <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/ear-care/en/">World Health Organization</a> estimates that over a billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing symptoms due to recreational noise exposure.</p>
<p>The use of hearing protection devices is recognized as a method of reducing noise exposure. However, the amount of people using these devices within recreational contexts just ‘some of the time’ can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722160/">as low as ~5%</a>, and even fewer people ‘always’ using them. Some people do tend to walk away from loud sources of noise, or go and take a break on a night out (e.g., regeneration break), and this is another method of protecting your hearing.</p>
<p>In order to improve hearing protection behaviors (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs, regeneration breaks) through interventions it would be beneficial to know how effective previous interventions have been in recreational contexts, and what were the active ingredients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327617/">behavior change techniques</a> (BCTs)) of these interventions trying to bring about the change.  Knowing what BCTs have been applied previously, or perhaps not, can help future designers of hearing protection interventions to potentially improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review of any intervention studies that measured a deliberate attempt to increase hearing protection behaviors during noisy recreational activities.</p>
<p>So what did we find? We found eight studies measuring behavior post-intervention, of which only three were experimental post-test designs (two randomized controlled studies and one quasi). The most common behavior reported was the use of earplugs, seen in all eight studies, with five having a small to medium effect (d ≥ 0·3 ≤ 0·5) at measuring an increase, or difference in earplug use – including all three experimental studies. The overall increase or difference in earplugs being used ‘some of the time’ across all eight studies ranged from 3% -14.6%, but with very few ‘always’ using earplugs people are at risk of acquiring hearing symptoms.</p>
<p>In terms of BCTs, across all studies we found a total of 17 different techniques had been deployed out of a possible 93 available from within the ‘<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23512568/">behavior change technique taxonomy version 1</a>’, with the majority serving an intervention category of ‘education’ (e.g., information about health consequences). With so few BCTs coded it leaves a large scope to test previously unused techniques. However, all three experimental studies restructured the environment by providing free earplugs (e.g., adding objects to the environment), and each measured a small to medium effect for at least one recreational context – perhaps indicating that this should be at least considered for future interventions.</p>
<p>Overall the results tell us there are very few hearing protection interventions addressing recreational noise exposure, a global hearing health concern, and those that have tackled the issue have had mixed success. Further intervention studies should be conducted that employ randomized controlled designs, with use of systematic approaches to intervention development (e.g. <a href="https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-6-42">the behavior change wheel</a>), as this will help target specific behavior change techniques in an effort to increase hearing protection behaviors and raise effect sizes.</p>
<p>Will you be reaching for your earplugs the next time?</p>

The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days.

In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure. For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45">Teufel et al. 2007</a>; <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43" id="__tag_746041107">Siniscalchi et al. 2008</a>).  <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.</b></span> There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ...

The <b>conspecific model</b> predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a <b>general emotion model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.<br /><br />The results sort of supported the <b>conspecific model</b> (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [<i>if I understand correctly</i>].

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-heart-injury-college-athletes-sports">College athletes show signs of possible heart injury after COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Amid growing concerns that a bout of COVID-19 might damage the heart, a small study is reporting signs of an inflammatory heart condition in college athletes who had the infection.</p>



<p>More than two dozen male and female competitive athletes at Ohio State University underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their hearts in the weeks to months after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.4916?guestAccessKey=ad3c4563-167f-452a-917f-7bfe15663b06&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=091120">images indicated swelling in the heart muscle</a> and possible injury to cells in four of the athletes, or 15 percent, researchers report online September 11 in <em>JAMA Cardiology</em>. That could mean the athletes had myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle most frequently caused by viral infections.</p>



<p>Heart images of eight additional athletes showed signs of possible injury to cells without evidence of swelling. It’s more difficult to interpret whether these changes in the heart tissue are due to coronavirus infection, says Saurabh Rajpal, a cardiologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. One limitation of the research is the lack of images of the athletes’ hearts prior to the illness for comparison, Rajpal and his colleagues write.</p>



<p>None of the 26 athletes in the study, who play football, soccer, basketball, lacrosse or run track, were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Twelve of the 26, including two of the four with signs of inflamed hearts, reported mild symptoms during their infection, such as fever, sore throat, muscle aches and difficulty breathing.</p>

<p>It will take more research to confirm the study’s findings and understand what they could mean for these young hearts. For now, the results suggest the heart may be at risk of injury, and serve as a reminder that after having COVID-19 — even with mild or no symptoms — young people need to pay close attention to how they are feeling when they return to exercise, says Rajpal. If they have symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath or an abnormal heart beat, he says, they should see a doctor.</p>



<p>It’s been apparent since early in the pandemic that COVID-19 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable">can be worse in patients who already have heart problems</a> (<em>SN: 3/20/20</em>). More recently, studies have reported on what the infection might do to the heart. For example, researchers assessed 100 German adult patients who’d recovered from COVID-19, one third of whom needed to be hospitalized. Cardiac MRIs revealed <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916">signs of heart inflammation</a> in 60 of these patients after their infection.</p>



<p>Those signals of heart inflammation could mean that the patients had developed myocarditis, which is estimated to occur in approximately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561509/">22 out of 100,000 people</a> annually around the world. Patients with myocarditis can experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue or a rapid or irregular heartbeat. The heart can recover from myocarditis, but in rare cases, the condition can damage the heart muscle enough to lead to heart failure.</p>





<p>For athletes diagnosed with myocarditis, the recommendation is to stop participating in sports for three to six months to give the heart time to heal, as animal evidence suggests that vigorous exercise when the heart is still inflamed worsens the injury. With a break from sports, young athletes can expect to recover from myocarditis. But the condition is taken seriously: A 2015 study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4496313/">estimated that 10 percent of sudden cardiac deaths</a> in NCAA athletes were due to myocarditis. When the Big Ten Conference, which includes Ohio State, announced in August that it was postponing its football season, one of the reported reasons was concerns about COVID-related myocarditis.</p>



<p>This new study of college athletes and COVID-19 “is really a step in the right direction,” says Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. “We need more data like this.” But it’s hard to draw firm conclusions from the findings, she says. Cardiac MRI usually is used to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis in combination with other clinical signs, including symptoms, blood test results that signal inflammation, high levels of a protein called troponin I that indicates stress on the heart and abnormal findings in an electrocardiogram.</p>

</aside>



<p>In the study, while some athletes had signs of possible myocarditis in imaging, their troponin I levels were normal, and their electrocardiograms didn’t look unusual. Wasfy sees a few possible explanations. Had the athletes been tested when they were first infected, those other clinical signs might have shown up. Perhaps the other indications had returned to normal by the time the cardiac MRI and other tests were performed. In that case, the MRI is a “ghost” of that prior inflammation and stress, she says.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 is impacting the heart muscle in a way that cardiologists aren’t accustomed to, absent some of the usual signs of inflammation and stress. Without those indicators of myocarditis, it’s hard to say if the heart had this condition, she says.</p>



<p>Some might argue that the imaging signs could be chalked up to differences between the hearts of competitive athletes and those of the more sedentary. Wasfy thinks that’s less likely, but cardiologists “certainly have a lot of work to do to define what the prevalence of these [imaging] findings is at baseline” in healthy athletes.</p>



<p>To expand on the study, Rajpal and his colleagues plan to take heart scans of more athletes, repeat cardiac MRIs in the athletes already imaged, and scan athletes who did not have COVID-19 to compare their images with those who have.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moth-learn-pollution-smog-altered-aromas-flower-smells">This moth may outsmart smog by learning to like pollution-altered aromas</a></h4>

<p>Pollution can play havoc with pollinators’ favorite flower smells. But one kind of moth can learn how to take to an unfamiliar new scent like, well, a moth to a flame.</p>



<p>Floral aromas help pollinators locate their favorite plants. Scientists have established that air pollutants scramble those fragrances, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polluted-scents">throwing off the tracking abilities</a> of such beneficial insects as honeybees (<em>SN: 4/24/08</em>). But new lab experiments demonstrate that one pollinator, the tobacco hawkmoth (<em>Manduca sexta</em>), can quickly learn that a pollution-altered scent comes from the jasmine tobacco flower (<em>Nicotiana alata</em>) that the insect likes.</p>



<p>That ability may imply that the moth can find food and pollinate plants, including crucial crops, despite some air pollution, researchers report September 2 in the <em>Journal of Chemical Ecology</em>. Scientists already knew that some pollinators can learn new smells, but this is the first study to demonstrate an insect overcoming pollution’s effects on odors.</p>



<p>Chemical ecologist Markus Knaden and colleagues focused on one pollutant — ozone, the main ingredient in smog. Ozone reacts with flower aroma molecules, changing their chemical structure and therefore their fragrance.</p>





<p>In Knaden’s lab at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, his team blew an ozone-altered <em>N. alata </em>scent from a tiny tube into a refrigerator-sized plexiglass tunnel, with a moth awaiting at the far end of the tunnel. Usually, when the moth smells the unaltered floral fragrance, it flies upwind and uses its long, skinny mouthparts to probe the tube the way that it would a blossom.</p>



<p>The researchers expected that the modified scent might throw the moth off a little. But the insect wasn’t attracted at all to a flower aroma exposed to levels of ozone that are typical on some hot, sunny days.</p>



<p>In addition to scent, tobacco hawkmoths track flowers visually, so Knaden’s team used that trait, along with a sweet snack, to train the moth to be attracted to a pollution-altered scent. The researchers wrapped a brightly-colored artificial flower around the tube to lure the moth back across the tunnel, despite the unfamiliar aroma. And the team added sugar water to the artificial flower. After a moth was given four minutes to taste the sweet stuff, it was attracted to the new smell when sent into the tunnel 15 minutes later, even when neither the sugar water nor the visual cue of the artificial flower was present. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>In the lab, researchers showed that tobacco hawkmoths can learn to drink from a fake flower whose scent has been scrambled by pollution. To train the moths to accept the altered scent, a visual cue — dressing up a tube emitting a fouled bouquet as an artificial flower — attracts the moth, and a sugar-water reward teaches the insect that it’s worth a return trip.</figure>



<p>Still, in an ozone-polluted environment in the wild, tobacco hawkmoths would have to be close enough to a tobacco flower to see it to learn its altered scent, and Knaden isn’t sure how often that will occur. The moths are difficult to observe in nature because they feed at twilight and are fast flyers.</p>



<p>“This study is a clarion call to other scientists” to examine whether and how different pollinators might also adapt to human-driven changes to their environment, says chemical ecologist Shannon Olsson of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bangalore, India, who wasn’t involved with the work.</p>



<p>Although the results suggest that some adaptation by insects to pollution is possible, Knaden is cautious about being too optimistic. “I don’t want the take-home message to be that pollution is not a problem,” he says. “Pollution is a problem.”</p>



<p>This study focused on only one moth species, but Knaden’s team is now working on planning experiments with other pollinators that are easier to follow than tobacco hawkmoths. While he suspects honeybees might also be as adaptable as the moth was, that won’t be true of every pollinator. “The situation can become very bad for insects that are not as clever or cannot see that well.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-clumps-galaxy-clusters-bend-light-surprisingly-well">Dark matter clumps in galaxy clusters bend light surprisingly well</a></h4>

<p>Dark matter just got even more puzzling.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/19-more-galaxies-mysteriously-missing-dark-matter-found">This unidentified stuff</a>, which makes up most of the mass in the cosmos, is invisible but detectable by the way it gravitationally tugs on objects like stars. (<em>SN: 11/25/19</em>). Dark matter’s gravity can also bend light traveling from distant galaxies to Earth — but now some of this mysterious substance appears to be bending light more than it’s supposed to. A surprising number of dark matter clumps in distant clusters of galaxies <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax5164">severely warp background light from other objects</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 11 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>This finding suggests that these clumps of dark matter, in which individual galaxies are embedded, are denser than expected. And that could mean one of two things: Either the computer simulations that researchers use to predict galaxy cluster behavior are wrong, or cosmologists’ understanding of dark matter is.</p>



<p>Very high concentrations of dark matter can act like a lens to bend light and drastically alter the appearance of background galaxies as seen from Earth — stretching them into arcs or splitting them into multiple images of the same object on the sky. “It’s totally cool. It’s like a fun house mirror,” says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale University.</p>





<p>Judging by computer simulations of galaxy clusters, clumps of dark matter around individual galaxies that are dense enough to cause such dramatic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">gravitational lensing</a> effects should be rare (<em>SN: 10/4/15</em>). Based on cluster simulations run by Natarajan and colleagues, “we would expect to see 1 [strong lensing] event in every 10 clusters or so,” says study coauthor Massimo Meneghetti, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics and Space Science Observatory of Bologna in Italy.</p>



<p>But telescope images told a different story. The researchers used observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope in Chile to investigate 11 galaxy clusters from about 2.8 billion to 5.6 billion light-years away. In that set, the team identified 13 cases of severe gravitational lensing by dark matter clumps around individual galaxies. These observations indicate there are more high-density dark matter clumps in real galaxy clusters than in simulated ones, Meneghetti says.</p>



<p>The simulations could be missing some physics that leads dark matter in galaxy clusters to glom tightly together, Natarajan says. “Or … there’s something fundamentally off about our assumptions about the nature of dark matter,” she says, like the notion that gravity is the only attractive force that dark matter feels.</p>



<p>Richard Ellis, a cosmologist at the University College London who was not involved in the work, thinks the crux of the problem is more likely in the computer simulations than in the nature of dark matter. “A cluster of galaxies is a very dangerous place. It’s like the Manhattan of the universe,” he says — busy with galaxies whizzing past one another, colliding and getting torn up. “There’s awful physics that goes into predicting how many of these little lensed things they should find,” Ellis says, so the new result “is intriguing, but my suspicion is that there’s something in the simulations … that isn’t quite right.”</p>



<p>Future observations with the upcoming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lumpy-universe-einstein-general-relativity">Euclid space telescope</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/17</em>), the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>) could help clear matters up, says Bhuvnesh Jain, an astrophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work. “These three telescopes are going to produce extremely large samples of galaxy clusters,” he says. That may lead to a new understanding of the physics in these turbulent environments, and help determine whether unrealistic simulations are to blame for this dark matter mystery.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/terroir-food-crops-environment-smell-taste">How does a crop’s environment shape a food’s smell and taste?</a></h4>

<p>About seven years ago, Kristin and Josh Mohagen were honeymooning in Napa Valley in California, when they smelled something surprising in their glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon: green pepper. A vintner explained that the grapes in that bottle had ripened on a hillside alongside a field of green peppers. “That was my first experience with terroir,” Josh Mohagen says.</p>



<p>It made an impression. Inspired by their time in Napa, the Mohagens returned home to Fergus Falls, Minn., and launched a chocolate business based on the principle of terroir, often defined as “sense of place.”</p>



<p>Different countries produce cocoa with distinct flavors and aromas, Kristin Mohagen says. Cocoa from Madagascar “has a really bright berry flavor, maybe raspberry, maybe citrus,” she says, while cocoa from the Dominican Republic “has a little more nutty, chocolaty taste.”</p>



<p>The couple estimates that back in 2013, when they founded Terroir Chocolate, about 50 other small batch chocolate companies in the United States were also touting terroir as integral to their products’ flavors.</p>



<p>Since then, terroir has continued to take hold as a marketing strategy — and not just for wine and chocolate. Terroir labels are also becoming more common for products like coffee, tea and craft beer, says Miguel Gómez, an economist at Cornell University who studies food marketing and distribution. Consumers “are increasingly interested in knowing where the products they are eating are produced — not only where but who is making them and how,” he says. People “value differences in the aromas, the flavors.”</p>

Pitra and P.D. Matthews/Hopsteiner</span></figure></div>



<p>The definition of terroir is somewhat fluid. Wine enthusiasts use the French term to describe the environmental conditions in which a grape is grown that give a wine its unique flavor. The soil, climate and even the orientation of a hillside or the company of neighboring plants, insects and microbes play a role. Some experts expand terroir to include specific cultural practices for growing and processing grapes that could also influence flavor.</p>



<p>The notion of terroir is quite old. In the Middle Ages, Cistercian and Benedictine monks in Burgundy, France, divided the countryside into <em>climats</em>, according to subtle differences in the landscape that seemed to translate into unique wine characteristics. Wines produced around the village of Gevrey-Chambertin, for example, “are famous for being fuller-bodied, powerful and more tannic than most,” says sommelier Joe Quinn, wine director of The Red Hen, a restaurant in Washington, D.C. “In contrast, the wines from the village of Chambolle-Musigny, just a few miles south, are widely considered to be more fine, delicate and light-bodied.”</p>





<p>Some scientists and wine experts are skeptical that place actually leaves a lasting imprint on taste. But a recent wave of scientific research suggests that the environment and production practices can, in fact, impart a chemical or microbial signature so distinctive that scientists can use the signature to trace food back to its origin. And in some cases, these techniques are beginning to offer clues on how terroir can shape the aroma and flavor of food and drink.</p>

<h4>Coffee’s chemical fingerprint</h4>



<p>Ecologist Jim Ehleringer of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City studies trace elements that plants passively take up. Those elements are a direct reflection of the soil. “Trace elements do not decay and so they become characteristic of a soil type and persist over time,” Ehleringer says.</p>



<p>To see if they could trace a coffee to its origin using the coffee’s blend of trace elements, Ehleringer and his team recently measured the concentrations of about 40 trace elements in more than four dozen samples of roasted arabica coffee beans from 21 countries. Roasting beans to different temperatures can affect the concentrations of individual elements. To correct for this roasting effect, Ehleringer calculated the ratio of each element to every other element in a sample, which remains fairly constant, even with roasting.  </p>



<p>In the Aug. 1 issue of <em>Food Chemistry</em>, his team reports that coffee beans from different regions <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814620304647">can have distinct chemical fingerprints</a>. A coffee’s chemical quality “comes down to geology,” Ehleringer says. Three samples of coffee beans from Yemen, for example, had a ratio of boron to manganese that was shared by less than 0.5 percent of coffee samples grown elsewhere.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Trace differences  </h3>



<p>The ratios of trace elements boron to manganese and calcium to cesium are enough to distinguish Yemeni coffee beans from those grown in other parts of the world. </p>

<p>Other researchers have used similar elemental analyses to find chemical signatures of place in products ranging from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956713519301331?via%3Dihub#!">wines produced in distinct growing regions in Portugal</a> to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.10449">peanuts grown in different provinces in China</a>.</p>



<p>The technique is valuable for validating origin when terroir is part of a product’s allure. Coffee farmers in Kona on Hawaii’s Big Island, for example, are using the results of an elemental analysis to support a class action lawsuit, scheduled for trial in November, against 21 major retailers. The suit claims those companies falsely market their coffees as “Kona” when the beans were actually grown elsewhere.</p>



<p>While an elemental analysis can authenticate a product’s terroir, it does not suggest that geology shapes flavor. Trace elements alone, says Ehleringer, “impart no flavor or taste.”</p>

<h4>Tracking cocoa to its source</h4>



<p>To try to link flavor to place, some scientists go after different chemical signatures altogether. At Towson University in Maryland, chemist Shannon Stitzel is tracing cocoa to its roots using organic compounds, which are mostly produced by the cocoa plant itself. The concentration of specific organic compounds in a plant can result from a complex mix of interacting factors — from the genes of a particular variety to components of terroir like climate and agricultural practices.</p>



<p>Stitzel works with samples of cocoa liquor — cocoa beans that have been fermented, dried, roasted and ground into a paste — from across the globe. At room temperature, cocoa liquor is a solid. But with a bit of heat, the paste melts into a glossy liquid that Stitzel describes as “a little thicker than honey.”</p>



<p>Using organic compounds to assign the cocoa liquor samples to their countries of origin is “not nearly as clean as when you do it with elemental analysis,” she says. In unpublished work, she was able to use an elemental analysis to accurately link cocoa liquor to its country of origin about 97 percent of the time.</p>





<p>But Stitzel turned to organic compounds because their presence may ultimately help explain the flavor differences that she, like the Mohagens, thinks very clearly exist between cocoa liquors from different countries. “You can open up each of the containers and the aroma is entirely different,” she says.</p>



<p>Stitzel recently identified concentrations of organic compounds in cocoa liquor from Vietnam, Indonesia, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico. She then used a statistical technique known as a discriminant analysis to group samples based on similar concentrations of nine organic compounds, including caffeine, a similar compound called theobromine and an antioxidant called epicatechin.  </p>



<p>On the American Chemical Society’s SciMeetings online platform in April, Stitzel reported that this chemical fingerprint was enough to <a href="https://www.morressier.com/article/chemical-signatures-uplcms-cocoa-provenance-determination/5e73d6ce139645f83c229f69">accurately identify the correct country of origin</a> for about 90 percent of the samples. In some cases, however, the samples didn’t form neat groups by country. Cocoa liquor samples from Honduras formed two different groups, depending on roasting temperature. Samples in the Honduras group that were roasted at the highest temperature were hard to tell apart from samples from Ecuador and Vietnam.</p>



<p>Stitzel now wants to add more compounds to the analysis to boost her sourcing accuracy and to connect regions to specific flavor compounds. “We’re still … trying to understand which compounds might be related to flavor,” she says. Her recent analysis already shows that caffeine, theobromine and epicatechin, which all produce a bitter flavor, can help set apart one country’s chocolates from another’s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>The roasting effect  </h3>



<p>Using a statistical technique known as a discriminant analysis, researchers grouped cocoa liquor samples according to similarities in the concentrations of nine organic compounds. Each country’s samples clustered together, except for those in the Honduras group that were roasted at the highest temperature; they overlapped (circled) with samples from Ecuador and Vietnam. </p>

<h4>The aroma of place</h4>



<p>Other researchers are finding that terroir leaves an imprint on the molecules that shape food’s aroma. Plants produce compounds known as aroma glycosides, which contain a sugar component linked to a volatile aromatic compound. When intact, aroma glycosides have no scent. But breaking the sugar-volatile bond — via high temperatures, low pH or enzymes from yeast — sets the volatile and its aroma free. The bouquet of a nicely aged bottle of wine is made up, in part, of aroma volatiles in the grapes that yeast enzymes let loose over time.</p>



<p>Many beer brewers, however, would rather your IPA have the same reliable flavor whether you pop open the bottle this Friday or in October. When volatile aromatics let loose in a bottled beer, that’s no good for large-volume brewers who need to ship consistent-tasting products. Brewers call that volatile release “beer creep,” says Paul Matthews, a senior research scientist in the Washington state branch of Hopsteiner, an international commercial hop grower and processor headquartered in New York City.</p>



<p>If brewers add hops (the flower of the hop plant) to beer early in the brewing cycle, heat breaks the sugar-volatile bond and the aroma from aroma glycosides is largely lost before bottling. The remaining flavor is more consistent over time. But when craft brewers make “dry hopped” beers like IPAs, adding the hops after the boiling stage, this late addition allows many aroma glycosides to go into fermentation and then into the bottle intact. The compounds release volatile aromatics as yeast enzymes break bonds even after the bottle is capped. So the aromas of these beers are more likely to “creep” over time.</p>



<p>Because genetics influences aroma and flavor, Matthews is exploring whether it’s possible to better control aroma glycoside concentrations through breeding. Breeding hop varieties to have lower concentrations could diminish the “beer creep” problem faced by large-volume craft brewers who distribute their beer over long distances.</p>



<p>At the same time, Matthews and colleagues are investigating the potential of breeding hop varieties to have higher aroma glycoside concentrations for use by smaller craft brewers, who are less concerned about shelf life but want to enhance the aroma of their beers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Hop plant cultivars from Yakima Valley" class="wp-image-3091061" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/091220_terroir_inline_hops-samples.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091061">Levels of four aroma glycosides, which can give beer its distinct aroma, were compared in the same hop plant cultivars grown in Washington’s Yakima Valley (shown) and Idaho’s Kootenay River valley. One aroma glycoside stood out as different depending on where the plant grew.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091061">Nicholi J. Pitra and P.D. Matthews/Hopsteiner</span></figure>



<p>Matthews recently tested whether aroma glycoside concentrations in individual hop cultivars are determined more by genetics or by terroir. “Of course, they are determined by both,” he says. “But if they are more genetic, we can breed for them.”</p>



<p>In collaboration with colleagues, including phytochemist Taylan Morcol of Lehman College in the Bronx, part of the City University of New York, Matthews grew the same 23 genetically distinct hop cultivars at two commercial fields with distinct terroirs. Matthews calls the Yakima Valley site in Washington state “desert in the shadow of Mount Rainier.” The other site, in the Kootenay River valley in Idaho, is “much more boreal — pine forest and humid,” he says.</p>



<p>At each location, the team measured the concentrations of four aroma glycosides in each hop cultivar. Genetics indeed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814620305069">played the biggest role</a> in determining how much aroma glycosides a hop plant produces, the researchers report in the Aug. 15 <em>Food Chemistry</em>. The concentrations of three of the aroma glycosides differed across cultivar types but remained fairly similar within the same cultivar grown in the two locations.</p>



<p>But for one aroma glycoside, terroir trumped genes in a big way. At the Kootenay site, all of the cultivars produced low concentrations of hexyl glucoside, a molecule that gives off a grassy aroma when its sugar bond is broken. But at the Yakima site, every one of these same cultivars, with genetics matching the plants in Kootenay, produced about two to eight times as much hexyl glucoside.</p>



<p>“There is a terroir difference,” Matthews says. The team can’t yet pinpoint which component of terroir causes the spike in hexyl glucoside at the Yakima site. The best guess: mites and aphids.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Terroir trumps genetics  </h3>



<p>Hop plant cultivars grown in Washington’s Yakima Valley produce higher levels of hexyl glucoside than the same cultivars grown in Idaho’s Kootenay River valley. The reason may be mites and aphids. </p>

</div>



<p>At Yakima, those critters, which munch on the hop plants, hang around for a longer portion of the growing season than at the Kootenay site. Matthews and his colleagues hypothesize that the plants might produce hexyl glucoside chemicals as a defense against the pests. When a mite or aphid munches on the plant, the volatile may be released to attract insects that will eat the mites or aphids.</p>



<p>The researchers are planning a follow-up experiment to test whether hop plants exposed to these pests in environmentally controlled chambers produce more of this grassy hexyl glucoside than hop grown under the same environmentally controlled conditions without the pests.</p>



<h4>Microbes leave their mark</h4>



<p>People have understood the importance of yeast in wine fermentation for <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/yeast-fermentation-and-the-making-of-beer-14372813/">at least two centuries</a>. About six years ago, food microbiologist David Mills of the University of California, Davis and graduate student Nicholas Bokulich, now a food microbiologist at ETH Zurich, discovered that groups of microbes may help shape the flavor of wine. Unique microbial communities in different California growing regions can <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/7/3/e00631-16.short">predict which metabolites will be present in the finished wine</a>, Mills, Bokulich and colleagues reported in 2016 in <em>mBio</em>. “Metabolites are any product of metabolism in any organism,” Bokulich says, adding that yeast, other fungi and bacteria each make varying contributions of metabolites in different wines.</p>



<p>“Those metabolites … have an aroma and a flavor,” says Kate Howell, a biochemist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. One of Howell’s own studies, she and her team reported online in August in <em>mSphere</em>, suggests that fungal species in particular <a href="https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/4/e00534-20">shape the metabolites</a> — and thus aroma and flavor — in wine from different growing regions in Australia.</p>



<p>Howell and colleagues studied microbes at 15 vineyards growing Pinot Noir grapes across six wine regions in southern Australia. At each vineyard, the team extracted fungal and bacterial DNA from the soil, as well as from what’s known as the “must” — destemmed, crushed grapes that haven’t yet been fermented. Then, the team identified 88 metabolites in the finished wine.</p>



<p>Different wine growing regions had distinct microbial communities in both the soil and the must, which appeared to influence the unique compositions of metabolites in the finished wine. The researchers found that over 80 percent of the metabolites found in the various wines were linked to the diversity of fungi found in the grape must. High levels of <em>Penicillium</em> fungi, for example, resulted in wine with low levels of octanoic acid, a volatile compound that can give wine a mushroom flavor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Fungal distinctions  </h3>



<p>The diversity of yeast and other fungi found in grape must (the crushed grapes that haven’t yet been fermented) differs across distinct wine growing regions in southern Australia that produce Pinot Noir grapes. Researchers linked these fungal communities to distinct collections of metabolites that affect aroma and flavor in the finished wine.  </p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/3535320/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/3535320" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>
</div>



<p>Howell hopes vintners may someday be able to manage microbes in the soil and throughout the fermentation process to bring out the best of the local microbial terroir. Today, nearly all of the yeasts that vintners purchase to add to their grape must are isolated from French vineyards and other famous wine regions, she says. “That doesn’t present the same value of place as encouraging diversity in the fermentation in the place that the grapes were grown.”</p>



<p>For his part, Quinn, of The Red Hen, eagerly awaits more scientific explorations of terroir. He would especially like to know why wines produced from the limestone-dominated Kimmeridgian soils in Chablis, Sancerre and Champagne, France, all have a chalky, saltlike mineral taste. Scientific research helps explain how wine reflects its place, Quinn says, “from the climatic elements to the microbial elements, what the earth is saying, and why [a particular] wine is so delicious.”</p>

<p>Despite much ado about the #metoo movement in recent years, the crisis of sexual harassment in academia persists without an end in sight. The <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a> now lists 1,051 cases, each of them a tragedy of trauma, unspeakable violations of victims, and dreams destroyed. I’ve written previously about two cases listed in the database (<a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/yuval-peres/">Yuval Peres</a> and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/terry-speed-a-male-feminist/">Terry Speed</a>). Now, I feel compelled to write about yet another sexual harassment case.</p>



<p><a href="https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/dumitrescu-ph-d-adrian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adrian Dumitrescu</a> is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I have known of his work for many years, as we have a shared interest in extremal combinatorics, having both worked on <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-04/S0273-0979-00-00877-6/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Erdös-Szekeres “Happy Ending Problem”</a>. Last week a Facebook post was brought to my attention, in which a graduate student describes a horrible case of sexual harassment by Prof. Dumitrescu that occurred during a conference in Boston in 2016.</p>



<p>This student filed a Title IX complaint with the University of Wisconsin, and I have a copy of the report. The Office of Equity and Diversity (EDS) that investigated the case found that “Based on the totality of the circumstances, the information obtained pursuant to this investigation, and for all the reasons set forth above, EDS concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding, by preponderance of the evidence, of sexual harassment against the Respondent [Prof. Dumitrescu].” Furthermore, the report states that “based on the seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct, EDS believes that disciplinary action is warranted in this matter, and recommends that the Provost refer this case for imposition of discipline”. As I write this post, Prof. Dumitrescu is still listed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.</p>



<p>Notably, after being sexually harassed by the Respondent, and before filing a report with Title IX, the student consulted her Ph.D. advisor. The report describes his response as follows: “[he] told her that the Respondent had a ‘high reputation’ in the field and it was better to ‘avoid trouble’ and not to report her concerns.” And yet she had the courage to report the case, despite the attempt to silence her, and having being threatened by the Respondent, as he coerced her to sleep with him, that if she did not acquiesce to his demands he would not conduct research with her and he might prevent senior scholars at her university from working with her.</p>



<p>The report details how the sexual harassment impacted the complainant’s research progress and mental well-being. Yet again, a talented young scientist finds herself with debilitating trauma, a career in jeopardy, and powerless in the face of an establishment that excuses harassers.</p>



<p>The details of this case are of course different than every other sexual harassment case. Each is tragic in its own way. And yet elements of what happened here are to be found in all sexual harassment cases. Power imbalance. Coercion. Threats. Silencing of the victim. Inaction. Banal injustice. This will be case number 1,052 in the <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a>.</p>



<p>We must do better.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed all our lives. For those of us fortunate enough to avoid unemployment, our work lives have still changed drastically. So how long should it take employees to recover psychologically, and settle into a “new normal”? According to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-61814-001.html">new paper,</a> published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, this process actually began very early on. This is among the first work to show that psychological recovery can start <em>during</em> a stressful experience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40268"></span></p>


<p>The pandemic has threatened workers’ wellbeing in all kinds of ways. As Eric Anicich at the University of Southern California and his colleagues point out, it has increased personal economic uncertainty (through furloughs and lay-offs and the prospect of more redundancies), constrained our physical movements and forced many of us to suddenly start working from home — as well as of course threatening our health, even our lives. All of these factors have challenged our autonomy, which is important for wellbeing because it entails feeling in control of our own actions, and seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals. (This particular aspect of autonomy is often referred to as “authenticity”).</p>



<p>The researchers set out therefore to explore how the pandemic might affect both feelings of powerlessnesss and authenticity. They focused on workers — specifically on full-time employees of 41 community colleges on the West Coast of the US.</p>



<p>One of the remarkable aspects of the study was its timing. The 117 participants completed background surveys during March 9 – 15, 2020. At this point, they were assessed for the personality trait of neuroticism and also gave demographic data. The main data collection then ran over two consecutive work weeks, starting March 16. It began, then, on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO and a “national emergency” by the US government.</p>



<p>Three times a day — in the morning, early afternoon and late afternoon — during those ten days, the participants used five-point scales to indicate their level of agreement with two statements: “Right now, I feel powerless” and “I feel like I am able to be truly myself right now”. They also rated their “current stress level regarding the COVID-19 situation”. (These surveys were purposefully very brief, in a bid to maintain participation over the fortnight.)</p>



<p>The analysis revealed two trends: over this period, the employees reported feeling <em>decreasingly</em> powerless and <em>more</em> authentic. However, their high stress levels did not change.</p>



<p>The team were able to compare this group’s responses with very similar types of data that they had collected from a different group in September 2019. They found that (unsurprisingly) the COVID-era group started out feeling more powerless and less authentic than the pre-COVID group. But for this 2019 group, there were no clear trends in changes over time for either measure. As the researchers write: “these results provide additional evidence that the temporal trajectories of powerlessness and authenticity observed in our focal dataset are unique to the time period associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.”</p>



<p>Previous studies exploring psychological recovery from a major stressor have tended to begin after the stressor has ended, and noted changes over months or even years. In contrast, this study shows that recovery (in relation to these two measures, at least) can begin almost immediately after the start of an ongoing stressful event. “Interestingly, these effects emerged while neither the objective situation nor the subjective stress reactions to it were improving,” the researchers note.</p>



<p>Also interestingly, those participants who’d scored relatively highly for neuroticism (which entails an increased tendency to feel anxious, depressed and vulnerable) at the start of the study showed the steepest decreases in powerlessness and increases in authenticity. Why? Perhaps, the team suggests, because during difficult times, people who tend to worry a good deal anyway suddenly have just cause — there’s a greater match between the state of the world and how they feel — and this is psychologically beneficial for them.</p>



<p>But how did these employees, as a group, manage to start this aspect of recovery immediately, when their stress levels were still high?</p>



<p>We are strongly motivated to tackle threats to our autonomy, the team notes. The study couldn’t reveal what changes, if any, the participants made in their lives. But they might have benefitted from a number of strategies, such as active detachment (spending time with pets, perhaps), relaxation, fostering a sense of mastery (if only through learning how to use Zoom…), even suddenly being able to wear whatever they wanted while working.</p>



<p>Still, as the participants’ stress levels were still high, their recovery was only partial. More research is clearly needed to explore what remedial strategies can help to rebuild autonomy — and to explore what happens to this marker of wellbeing (as well as others) into the longer term. But the study does  at least reveal that (for people with jobs, and of course that’s worth stressing) our psychological immune system is able to rally against at least some aspects of an attack like COVID-19.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drones-native-american-settlement-etzanoa-kansas-pasture">Drones find signs of a Native American ‘Great Settlement’  beneath a Kansas pasture</a></h4>

<p>Specially equipped drones flying over a Kansas cattle ranch have detected the buried remnants of a horseshoe-shaped ditch made more than 400 years ago by ancestors of today’s <a href="http://www.wichitatribe.com/history/in-the-beginning-1540-1750.aspx">Wichita and Affiliated Tribes</a>, scientists say.</p>



<p>The find adds to suspicions that the Kansas site was part of a sprawling population center that Spanish explorers dubbed the Great Settlement in 1601, archaeologist Jesse Casana of Dartmouth College and his colleagues report August 24 in <em>American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Called Etzanoa by a captive the Spanish took from the Great Settlement, it could turn out to be one of the largest Native American settlements ever established north of Mexico, if confirmed by further research. The largest currently known is <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/198/">Cahokia</a>, a site in what’s now Illinois where as many as 20,000 people lived between 1050 and 1150.</p>



<p>Ancestral Wichita communities in Kansas and northern Oklahoma that date to between around 1425 and 1650 existed in a time frame during which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-offering-late-titicaca-sacred-religious-supernatural">South America’s Inca civilization</a> rose and fell (<em>SN: 8/3/20</em>). In the 1800s, European settlers drove ancestral Wichita people from their native lands, leading to the destruction of their villages and communal traditions.</p>





<p>The newly discovered earthwork, a 2-meter-wide ditch that forms a semicircle about 50 meters across, is similar to other circular earthworks known as council circles. Five council circles have been found among 22 ancestral Wichita sites excavated along an eight-kilometer stretch of the Little Arkansas and Smoky Hill rivers, around 230 kilometers north of the newly surveyed site.</p>



<p>“We apparently have located the sixth council circle and the only one that has not been disturbed,” says anthropological archaeologist Donald Blakeslee of Wichita State University. Farming and construction projects have damaged or covered many ancestral Wichita sites.</p>



<p>Drone surveys “can truly transform our ability to locate sites and map important features where huge areas have been plowed and surface traces of houses and ditches are often close to invisible,” says archaeologist Douglas Bamforth of the University of Colorado Boulder, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Etzanoa site viewed by drone" class="wp-image-3091198" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090420_BB_etzanoa_inline-1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091198">Images from a drone survey that probed underneath a Kansas pasture (right) helped scientists identify a large, circular ditch bordered by two pits (shown in gray, left) and areas where houses may have been built. A previously excavated area lies near the location of the underground earthwork.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091198">J. Casana <em>et al/Amer. Antiquity</em> 2020</span></figure>



<p>It’s unclear how ancestral Wichita people used council circles. Researchers have suggested that these structures were places for ritual ceremonies, houses of social elites or protection from attackers. </p>



<p>Based on previous discoveries of items made of obsidian, seashells and other exotic materials at council circles, these structures must have hosted rituals of some kind, says archaeologist Susan Vehik of the University of Oklahoma in Norman. Drone imagery alone can’t establish whether rituals occurred at the buried earthwork or if, perhaps, non-combatants hid behind walls along its borders when the site was attacked. For now, she says, the drone discovery is an intriguing mystery.</p>



<p>Blakeslee was inspired by publications of an archaeologist who excavated at the same bluff site more than 60 years ago and suspected it had been a central part of Etzanoa. Since then, Blakeslee’s excavations along the Walnut River have filled in gaps between ancestral Wichita sites. Etzanoa likely existed as a single, spread-out community, Blakeslee contends. Upstream from Etzanoa sites, excavations have uncovered remnants of a separate Wichita town that ran for about three kilometers, he says.</p>



<p>From 2015 to 2019, <a href="https://etzanoa.com/etzanoa/">Blakeslee directed an excavation</a> at the House family cattle ranch in southeastern Kansas that uncovered ancestral Wichita objects such as stone tools and cooking utensils as well as 17th century Spanish items, including a horseshoe nail and bullets. These finds supported Spanish documents and maps of Etzanoa that resulted from the 1601 expedition to Wichita territory, and led <a href="https://etzanoa.com/etzanoa-visits-the-kansas-house/">the Kansas state legislature in 2017</a> to designate the site and its surrounding area as Etzanoa.</p>



<p>Blakeslee’s artifact discoveries also led to the new drone survey. Casana directed aerial sweeps over grazing land at the cattle ranch, where ancient structures had likely suffered minimal damage. Drone-mounted equipment measured heat and radiation differences in the ground to detect buried structures.</p>



<p>The underground earthwork at the House ranch lay near the highest point of the property, overlooking the river valley. Other circular earthworks of the ancestral Wichita and neighboring groups in the southern Great Plains were also built at elevated spots, Casana’s team says.</p>



<p>Drone imagery also picked up signs of two pits, one dug at or near each end of the semicircular structure. Makers of the earthwork may have removed soil from the pits to construct mounds inside its borders, as has been observed at excavated council circles in the region. Erosion may have partly worn away what was originally a circular earthwork, the researchers speculate.</p>



<p>Blakeslee plans to explore more underground features of the Kansas site with additional remote sensing techniques before starting excavations so that digging can precisely target the earthwork and any surrounding remains. That will also up the likelihood of uncovering material suitable for radiocarbon dating and revealing the age of the earthworks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></h4>

<p>For decades there have been murders of unarmed black people by the police, which in recent years has been exposed and protested by the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This summer, unprecedented numbers of protesters have voiced their outrage in response to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the very recent and utterly senseless shooting of Jacob Black, and countless other acts of violence. Many mayors have announced plans for reform. The protests have rightly focused on the roles of race and racism in police brutality, but more attention needs to be given to the role of gender, particularly as municipalities seek to repair the police force to avoid this unnecessary use of force and violence.</p><p>Using data from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department in California, a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807313995?journalCode=cjbb&amp;">2008 study</a> found that male officers were three times more likely to commit unwarranted shootings than their female counterparts. Additionally, white male police officers were 57% more likely than Latino male officers to commit such a shooting. These statistics refer to the group that constitutes the majority of police officers in America—white men.</p><p>But even more importantly, the culture of police departments tends to be macho and hyper-masculine—<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J012v16n03_01">a culture which glorifies violence</a>. This has always been the case but it has intensified as police departments across the county have moved from the community policing approach to militarization, aided by federal grants.</p><p>While among the general public masculinity is seen as synonymous with being male, psychologists view it differently—as a set of social norms, in this case norms for how boys and men should think, act, and feel. Masculinity is problematic in that that most boys are made to feel that they must conform to gender norms—that is, act in ways consistent with their gender. Masculinity is presented as obligatory for most boys, and most <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037262">boys feel they have no other choice but to conform to masculine norms</a>. This is not true for girls, who are given much more flexibility and latitude when it comes to their performance of gender than are boys. Furthermore, one of the principal functions of masculinity is to establish several hierarchies: of men over women, of white men over men of color, and of straight cisgender men over gay, bisexual, and transgender men.</p><p>To move away from the macho and hyper-masculine culture, police forces must diversify—not only in race but in gender—their ranks and leadership. The presence of many more women, openly LGBTQ people, and non-white officers on the police force, and deploying training designed to heighten awareness of masculinity and its relationship to violence, will be crucial in this regard.</p><p>Although most boys are expected to conform to masculinity norms, most adult men come to accept who they are, even if they do not meet the masculinity ideals. Masculinity is, after all, a tough standard. That is, they come to terms with the messages from their childhoods and recognize that their unique personalities do not fit or need to fit the ideal in all ways, perhaps saying to themselves “I am not the most masculine guy in the world but that’s OK.” A smaller group feels deeply ashamed of themselves for violating the masculine norms. Experimental research using the “precarious manhood” paradigm has shown that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402669">such men, when their masculinity is threatened, tend to respond with aggression</a>.</p><p>The research that has been conducted over the past 40+ years shows that one or another scale that measures masculinity is correlated with one or another harmful outcome, many related to violence. Since most adult men do not conform to masculine norms, what accounts for these harmful outcomes? One source is the group of men who respond to threats to their masculinity aggressively. In addition, masculinity’s destructive outcomes also arise from those men who “check all the boxes,” and conform to masculine norms to the greatest extent. These are the men whom we might label as hyper-masculine. Both groups of men tend to populate police departments as currently constituted. Their influence must be diluted by diversifying police forces.</p><p><em>Featured image by Free-Photos from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/squad-car-police-lights-city-urban-1209719/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/635333678/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/campus-activists-show-us-how-to-end-gender-based-violence/" rel="nofollow">Campus activists show us how to end gender-based violence</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/little-boy-1635065_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Adverse childhood experiences related to negative health outcomes</strong></p>
<p>As researchers, we often try to pinpoint the causes of negative outcomes in adults. What factors contribute to obesity? What about heart disease? Why are some people more prone to depression and anxiety while others are not? Surely it is not random chance why some individuals are more prone to these outcomes while others are not.</p>
<p>While each outcome may be linked to something specific (i.e., a person’s chance of getting lung cancer increases exponentially if they smoke), there is one factor that has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes like lung cancer, heart disease, anxiety, depression, obesity, unemployment, divorce, and even poor athletic performance.</p>
<p>What’s the factor that is linked to all of these outcomes?  The term is called “adverse childhood experiences,” or ACEs for short.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, a researcher named Vincent Felitti ran an obesity clinic in California. Around 50% of the participants dropped out, while the other 50% successfully completed the program. He decided to interview many of the dropouts, and found a common theme: Nearly all of them experienced some form of sexual, physical, or mental abuse as children. Interviews from the group that completed the program revealed only a very small percentage reported the same abuse.</p>
<p>Felitti eventually collaborated with a colleague, Robert Anda, in a large study of 17,000 individuals. In that study, Felitti and Anda identified eight domains of ACEs: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, parental separation/divorce, interpersonal violence, incarcerated family member, family mental illness, and family substance use.</p>
<p>Regardless of the event, Felitti and Anda found that the more numerical experiences an individual had, the more likely they were to have negative outcomes as adults.  Essentially, every person has an ACE score, ranging from 0 (no adverse events before the age of 18) to 8 (adverse events in all 8 categories).</p>
<p>All this said, public health researchers and practitioners in all areas of prevention/intervention (e.g., mental health professionals, substance abuse counselors, etc.), have been trying to develop programs which either 1. Limit the number of ACEs people have, or 2. Help people deal with their ACEs as adults in order to help lessen their effect.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>This is where our recent article titled, “The Frequencies and Disparities of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the U.S.” published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> helps advance the field of ACEs.  In the article, we collected the most comprehensive ACEs dataset to date: 211,376 adults across 34 states.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study helps shed light on precisely who is at-risk for higher ACEs. We report several noteworthy findings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</li>
<li>Almost one-quarter (22%) experienced three or more ACEs.</li>
<li>Women were more likely to experience ACEs compared to men</li>
<li>Black, Hispanic, and Multi-racial individuals were more likely to have more ACEs compared to White individuals.</li>
<li>People who identify as a sexual minority (lesbian, gay, or bisexual) were more likely to have more ACEs compared to heterosexual individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future implications</strong></p>
<p>So what does this all mean? There are several implications to the study. First, the more we know about ACEs, the greater the chances we have in both preventing ACEs and lessening their effect.  Next, ACEs are not equally distributed amongst the general population.  Some groups have a higher likelihood of experiencing ACEs, making them uniquely more prone to negative outcomes due to ACEs. Having insight into which groups are particularly vulnerable to ACEs is helpful for professionals that work in fields dealing with the repercussions of ACEs (like mental health counselors). Knowledge about which groups have a higher likelihood of ACE exposure will aid in tailoring programmatic responses to these groups.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-pause-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-trial">Here’s what pausing the AstraZeneca-Oxford coronavirus vaccine trial really means</a></h4>

<p>A single volunteer’s illness has sparked a temporary halt to the late-stage clinical trial of a leading coronavirus vaccine, an action that highlights the level of rigor needed to ensure that a vaccine is safe and effective, experts say.</p>



<p>AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine in concert with the University of Oxford, pushed pause on September 8 after a study volunteer in the United Kingdom had a suspected serious reaction. The hiatus will allow an independent review board to decide what to do next.</p>



<p>The illness may turn out to have nothing to do with the vaccine. If so, the trial, which may enroll as many as 50,000 people worldwide, including up to 30,000 in the United States, may resume. If the vaccine caused the illness — known as a serious adverse event — it could spell the end for AstraZeneca’s vaccine hopes. But experts say the pause is part of the tricky business of doing science and needed to happen to ensure safety. </p>

<p>“It was actually encouraging to see AstraZeneca take it so seriously,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute think tank. “They did exactly the right thing.”</p>



<p>AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical companies testing COVID-19 vaccines that, in an open letter released September 8, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200908005282/en/Biopharma-Leaders-Unite-Stand-Science">pledged not to be rushed</a> by political considerations and to follow standard procedures to make sure vaccines are thoroughly tested. </p>



<p>What members of the public often don’t understand is that the courses of clinical trials often don’t run smoothly and Phase III trials are put on hold temporarily on a regular basis, says Seema K. Shah, a bioethicist at Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago. In fact, “bumps in the road are normal for vaccine trials, and they should happen if you’re studying them rigorously,” she says. “If nothing goes wrong while you’re testing it, maybe you didn’t test it well enough.” </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait to see if there really is a safety concern or if this was a false alarm, she says. “In normal times this would happen and it wouldn’t be international news. But right now the whole world is watching these vaccine trials and we’re all holding our breath waiting for the results.” </p>



<p>Vaccine <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-clinical-trials-resumed-in-the-uk.html">trials resumed</a> in the United Kingdom on September 12 after the U.K.’s Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it was safe to do so, AstraZeneca said in a statement. Brazil’s trial also resumed September 12. In the United States, AstraZeneca had <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/development-of-covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-expands-into-us-phase-iii-clinical-trial-across-all-adult-age-groups.html#!">just started recruiting volunteers</a> for a Phase III trial when the pause occurred. The company, citing privacy concerns, declined to release any more medical information about the participant involved in the incident.</p>



<p>Prior to the restart, <em>Science News</em> spoke with experts about what a pause might mean for the future of a coronavirus vaccine.</p>





<h4>What is this vaccine?</h4>



<p>The vaccine is a combination of two viruses. Researchers at Oxford and a university spin-off company Vaccitech started with a weakened version of an adenovirus that causes colds in chimpanzees. This same chimpanzee adenovirus was used to make an Ebola vaccine. To fight coronavirus, the chimp virus was engineered to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response">deliver instructions to human cells</a> for making the iconic knobby “spike” protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (<em>SN: 7/21/20</em>). </p>



<p>Some other potential coronavirus vaccines now in testing use human adenoviruses to carry the spike protein. But since many people have caught colds caused by adenoviruses, they may already have antibodies that could make the vaccine less effective. Using a chimpanzee virus that doesn’t infect people could get around that problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="tray of vials of vaccine" class="wp-image-3091297" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090920_ts_covid-vaccine-trial_inline_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091297">AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, has been working with researchers at the University of Oxford to scale up manufacturing of their coronavirus vaccine.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091297">University of Oxford</span></figure>



<p>In preclinical <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2608-y">tests with rhesus macaques</a>, the vaccine protected against coronavirus infections, researchers reported July 30 in <em>Nature</em>. And in early studies in people, the vaccine <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31604-4/fulltext">stimulated production of antibodies</a> against the spike protein, researchers reported online July 20 in the <em>Lancet</em>. That study tested the coronavirus vaccine in 534 volunteers. </p>



<p>Those people reported mostly mild side effects, such as headaches, fatigue and muscle pain. But to determine whether the vaccine actually works, and is safe, it has to be tested in many thousands of people. The halted Phase III trials were comparing the vaccine candidate to a placebo. If the vaccine works, more people in the placebo group will wind up getting COVID-19 than in the vaccinated group. </p>



<h4>What happened?</h4>



<p>All that is known officially is that one of the study volunteers went to the hospital after having neurological problems. Some news reports have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/health/coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-safety.html">cited unnamed sources</a> saying that a woman participating in the trial <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/09/astrazeneca-covid19-vaccine-trial-hold-patient-report/">experienced symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis</a>, a spinal cord inflammatory syndrome. </p>



<p>Transverse myelitis has surfaced in vaccine trials before. Symptoms range from numbness, tingling or pain to limb paralysis and bladder problems. Doctors often treat the disorder with steroids that calm the inflammatory process, though serious cases can have long-term consequences.</p>



<p>“In the history of vaccine development, cases of myelitis are not especially surprising,” says Carlos Pardo-Villamizar, a clinical neurologist and director of the Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center. Though rare, transverse myelitis has popped up in vaccine trials for rabies, yellow fever and H1N1 influenza, among others, he says. </p>



<p>The disorder is “inflammation as a consequence of some immunological triggering factor,” he says, like a virus, bacteria or autoimmune disorder. On rare occasions, vaccines can elicit the same sort of immunological misfiring. </p>



<p>A similar reaction, called Guillain-Barré syndrome, was associated with the 1976 flu vaccine, where <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html">one out of 100,000 people</a> had an elevated risk of experiencing symptoms like muscle weakness or paralysis. Since then, some vaccines have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, but it’s rare. Typically, there are one or two cases per million doses of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>“My message for the public is don’t panic, this is somewhat expected,” Pardo-Villamizar says, These are the sorts of complications that need to be rigorously evaluated before a vaccine is made public, he says. </p>



<h4>Is halting a trial unusual?</h4>



<p>No. It’s routine if an adverse event is serious enough to send a person to the hospital. It’s built into the process. </p>



<p>One main point of a clinical trial is to tease out any health issues related to the vaccine. Some side effects are expected and manageable, such as redness or swelling at the site of the injection, fever, aching muscles or joints, headaches or fatigue. But serious adverse events need to be studied to understand whether it was related to the vaccine or a coincidence.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Pausing a clinical trial to investigate a serious health issue “is certainly part of standard practice in ongoing trials,” says Susan Ellenberg, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. Taking time to scrutinize a reported severe reaction is a sign that the system is working, says Ellenberg. “This is what’s supposed to happen.” </p>



<p>Some trials’ rules would require an investigation even if a volunteer got into a car accident, just to be sure there’s no way it’s connected to participating in the trial. “These triggers are predetermined and written into protocols in ways that mean that you can’t change your mind” to gloss over a potential safety problem, says Paul G. Thomas, an immunologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. </p>



<h4>What happens next?</h4>



<p>An independent data safety monitoring board will collect the data and investigate what went wrong. Such safety boards are required for all clinical trials. “They have no vested interest in the vaccine. They’re not the people who invented the vaccine. They’re not people who could ever make money off the vaccine,” Thomas says.  </p>



<p>Sometimes boards stop trials early because of safety concerns. Trials also might come to an early end if it becomes blindingly obvious that one group is faring much better than another, because a drug or vaccine works really well, Thomas says. </p>



<p>In the case of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, the first thing the board will probably do is determine whether the woman was in the group that got the placebo or the one that got the vaccine, says William Schaffner, an infectious diseases doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. </p>



<p>“This investigation could be very brief,” he says. “They could discover, oh that person got a placebo. No problemo. The trial can continue. It was a coincidence.” </p>



<p>But if the person got the vaccine, “then we’re stuck in a difficult position.” The board will have to evaluate all the data, including the volunteer’s medical history, to determine whether the vaccine caused her illness. If the board determines the vaccine was the cause, “it could bring the whole trial of this vaccine to a halt.” Schaffner says. “That’s how serious this event and its subsequent investigation is. Very heavy.”</p>



<p>There was no way to tell from testing in animals or in smaller numbers of people that such a side effect might happen when the vaccine was given to large numbers of people. Phase III trials are designed in part to uncover rare side effects and reactions, Schaffner says. “This is a vastly rare and unforeseen event that could not have been anticipated.” </p>



<p>Even if the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine fails, FasterCures is tracking 210 vaccines at various stages of development, Krofah says. “If one fails, there are many more under investigation.” She is encouraged that the company is following the normal clinical trial procedures. “We need to continue to focus on the science and be adamant about transparency in the data on safety and efficacy.” </p>

<p>Although older adults face the highest risk of being hospitalized with or dying from COVID-19, younger adults can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-young-adults-can-face-severe-cases">end up in the hospital</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/20</em>). If they do, the outcome can be serious, and a new study is providing a look at just how severe the disease can be for those patients.</p>



<p>Of roughly 3,200 people ages 18 to 34 who were admitted to 419 U.S. hospitals from early April to the end of June, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.5313?guestAccessKey=4da3c738-c1dd-4d84-9669-37eb049e13b8&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=090920">21 percent, or 684 people, landed in intensive care</a> and 10 percent, or 331 patients, ended up on ventilators. Almost 3 percent, or nearly 90 people, died, researchers report September 9 in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>. </p>



<p>Those numbers are “alarming figures given that COVID-19 outbreaks are rampant in many U.S. colleges that have opened for in-person learning,” says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Younger adults now make up nearly a quarter of U.S. coronavirus cases.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>A 3 percent death rate is lower than what has been reported for hospitalized older adults with COVID-19 — which was more than 20 percent in two separate studies from the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765184">United States</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30316-7/fulltext">Germany</a> — but still higher than it is for some other illnesses. For instance, it’s more than twice the death rate for heart attacks in young adults, the researchers wrote.</p>



<p>Underlying conditions like severe obesity or high blood pressure were linked to more serious illness or death. And the team found that younger adults who have multiple underlying conditions can face similar risks of serious illness and death as people 35 to 64 years old without those conditions. More than half of the hospitalized young adults were Black or Hispanic, although race or ethnicity was not associated with an increased risk of death or needing a ventilator.</p>



<p>Seeing more severe disease in younger adults with underlying conditions mirrors findings from larger populations that include people from other age groups, says Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>Because the study considered only hospitalized patients, it can’t say what the risk is for young adults in general who are infected with the coronavirus, he says. But “if you get hospitalized, your risk of complications is high, and that should be concerning for everyone whether they are a child, young adult or senior citizen,” Milstone says.</p>



<p>What’s more, 3 percent of the people who survived their hospital stay needed more care in a nursing facility afterward. It’s unknown whether any of the other patients discharged from the hospital suffered from lingering COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>“Young people often shrug off their risk, citing their age,” Gordon says. But the findings underscore the fact that younger people at still at risk of severe symptoms, she says, particularly if they have other health conditions.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/BNEP-blog-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at an extremely high risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  In addition, most patients have additional risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Should more be done to help improve their risk and overall health? What if clinicians could prescribe an exercise regimen? Are there additional hemodialysis specific benefits to exercising?</p>
<p>In a recent <em>BMC Nephrology </em>publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02021-2">Bogataj et al.</a> performed a randomised controlled trial to examines the effects of intradialytic cycling and functional training on dialysis adequacy and other biochemical parameters. Participants were divided into a functional training intervention group (with intradialytic cycling) and an intradialytic cycling only control group. For the first eight weeks, participants in the intervention group performed guided functional exercise training three times a week before each dialysis session and additional intradialytic cycling exercise. This included a warm-up, full range of motion exercises with additional weights, and a cool-down with stretching.  For the second eight weeks the same group took the functional training home to do on non-dialysis days. The authors concluded that in both groups the dialysis adequacy improved and was sustained through the entire study; however, additional benefits were found in the intervention group, with promising improvements in the participants’ total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<p>The improvement in dialysis adequacy with exercise during hemodialysis is not new. In 2004, <a href="https://www.dustri.com/article_response_page.html?artId=480&amp;doi=10.5414/CNP61261&amp;L=0">Parsons et al.</a> also conducted an eight week study looking at intradialytic exercise and found that there was enhanced dialysate urea removal. The physiology of how improved dialysis adequacy occurs is thought to be through an increase in muscle blood flow and increase in oxygen extraction, which increases capillary surface area and increases the exchange of substances from the tissue to the vascular compartment. This increased diffusion into the vascular compartment allows for substances like urea to be removed by dialysis.  Therefore, improved dialysis adequacy. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/14/12/2927/1818764">Kong et al.</a> demonstrated a 14% increase in dialysis adequacy from 60 minutes of intradialytic exercise.  This increase is equivalent to increasing a dialysis session by 20 minutes. It would be interesting to find out how many of my patients would prefer cycling during dialysis for an hour rather than increasing their dialysis time. Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p>
<blockquote><p>Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Bogataj et al article, there was also improvement in total cholesterol and LDL for the intervention group. There is clear evidence for preventing major cardiovascular events and mortality with lowering LDL for those with normal or slightly abnormal kidney function. For patients with CKD and ESKD, it can still be controversial. Our guidelines do not advocate starting every ESKD patient on a statin but what about lowering cholesterol with exercise? This type of intervention for cholesterol improvement still needs to be studied over a longer period with examining cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>If budget was not an issue, I might consider purchasing customized cycling equipment for my in-center hemodialysis patients and hiring a kinesiologist or personal trainer to perform rounds in the dialysis unit like our dietician and social worker. With time, I imagine we will have larger, longer duration studies that will further support the idea that a novel exercise prescription strategy has specific health benefits for patients with CKD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-warm-water-sea-level-climate">New maps show how warm water may reach Thwaites Glacier’s icy underbelly</a></h4>

<p>New seafloor maps reveal <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020">the first clear view</a> of a system of channels that may be helping to hasten the demise of West Antarctica’s vulnerable Thwaites Glacier. The channels are deeper and more complex than previously thought, and may be funneling warm ocean water all the way to the underside of the glacier, melting it from below, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Scientists estimate that meltwater from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">Florida-sized Thwaites Glacier</a> is currently responsible for about 4 percent of global sea level rise (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). A complete collapse of the glacier, which some researchers estimate could happen within the next few decades, could increase sea levels by about 65 centimeters. How and when that collapse might occur is the subject of a <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org/">five-year international collaborative research effort</a>.</p>



<p>Glaciers like Thwaites <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seafloor-map-shows-why-greenland-glaciers-melt-different-rates">are held back from sliding seaward</a> both by buttressing ice shelves — tongues of floating ice that jut out into the sea — and by the shape of the seafloor itself, which can help pin the glacier’s ice in place (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>). But in two new studies, published online September 9 in <em>The Cryosphere</em>, the researchers show how the relatively warm ocean waters may have a pathway straight to the glacier’s underbelly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="illustration of seafloor pathways for warm water near Thwaites Glacier" class="wp-image-3091251" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090820_cg_thwaites_inline.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091251">Channels carved into the seafloor, extending several kilometers wide and hundreds of meters deep, may act as pathways (red line with yellow arrows as seen in this 3-D illustration) to bring relatively warm ocean waters to the edges of vulnerable Thwaites Glacier, hastening its melting.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091251">International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration</span></figure>



<p>From January to March 2019 researchers used a variety of airborne and ship-based methods — including radar, sonar and gravity measurements — to examine the seafloor around the glacier and two neighboring ice shelves. From those data, the team was able to estimate <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/10.5194/tc-14-2883-2020">how the seafloor is shaped beneath the ice itself</a>.</p>



<p>These efforts revealed a rugged series of high ridges and deep troughs on the seafloor, varying between about 250 meters and 1,000 meters deep. In particular, one major channel, more than 800 meters deep, could be funneling warm water all the way from Pine Island Bay to the submerged edge of the glacier, the team found.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Not all confessions are created equal. In a criminal justice setting, some admissions of guilt are both sincere and corroborated — but others are not, having been coerced, given by vulnerable or underage defendants, or unreliably reported secondhand. Yet mock jury trials have shown that lay people often tend to take a confession at face value, handing down a guilty verdict without considering other potential evidence.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Fabiana Alceste from City University of New York and colleagues question just how well people really understand the existing body of evidence on reliable, admissible confessions in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acp.3735">new paper in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em></a>. The answer to that question could have ramifications not only for those on juries but also for the people they’re deciding whether to convict.</p>


<p><span id="more-40254"></span></p>


<p>To examine lay beliefs, the researchers presented 151 participants with thirty statements related to interviews, interrogations and confessions, some true and some false. These statements had previously been presented to a panel of confession experts, and related to one of four areas: general principles of psychology (e.g. “compared to most adults, adolescents exhibit immaturity of judgment in their decision-making”), truth and deception detection (e.g. “trained police can distinguish between truths and lies at high levels of accuracy”), police interrogation tactics (e.g. “threats of physical violence during interrogation can lead an innocent person to confess to a crime”), and confessions (e.g. “confessions can be verified as true by the details that they contain about the crime”).</p>



<p>After viewing each statement, participants indicated how reliable they thought the evidence behind it was, responding with either: “the reverse is probably true”, “the evidence does not support it”, “the evidence is inconclusive”, “the evidence tends to favour it”, “the evidence is generally reliable”, “the evidence is very reliable”, or “I don’t know”. Participants also indicated whether or not they <em>personally</em> agreed or disagreed with each assertion, as well as stating whether or not they believed a jury would benefit from hearing testimony from an expert in a trial involving a disputed confession.</p>



<p>A majority of participants correctly endorsed all of the statements relating to psychological principles — the effects of reward and punishment on behaviour, adolescent decision-making and sleep deprivation, for example. Experts and laypeople were generally in agreement on these statements, though experts endorsed them at significantly higher rates.</p>



<p>When it came to deception detection, however, a majority of participants endorsed <em>unsupported</em> statements — that trained experts can accurately judge truth or lies from facial microexpressions, for example, or through non-verbal behavioural cues. The panel of experts, on the other hand, correctly rejected these propositions.</p>



<p>There were also some large discrepancies when it came to interrogation tactics. While 84% of participants correctly identified that torture can get innocent people to confess, only 56% believed that false claims of evidence implicating the suspect in the crime can do the same — versus 94% of experts who asserted that it can. Worryingly, significantly more participants believed Miranda rights (your “right to remain silent”) adequately protected against false confessions — 49% to the experts’ 25%.</p>



<p>When the team looked at beliefs about <em>reliability</em> of research, however, the gap between participants and experts widened further. Both laypeople and experts personally disagreed with the statement “innocent people never provide false confessions voluntarily”, for instance — but while nearly every expert indicated the research did not support the statement, many laypeople believed the evidence was still inconclusive or even supported the statement.. The same disparity was  found for a number of other statements about confessions.</p>



<p>Almost all participants — 94% — believed that juries would benefit from hearing expert testimony. Yet they rarely answered “I don’t know” to the questions, suggesting that they were not particularly clear on their <em>own</em> lack of knowledge. Future research could explore this  gap further by looking at participants’ confidence in each answer — working out whether people don’t know what they don’t know, in other words.</p>



<p>Despite the clear value of expert knowledge on confessions, many courtrooms do not accept it as admissible testimony, instead relying on juries using common sense. But that “common sense”, as this study highlights, does not always match up to the body of evidence surrounding confessions.</p>



<p>The team suggests that confession experts <em>should</em> be permitted to give testimony to juries, who may not possess reliable information about admissible evidence and instead harbour incorrect beliefs. Understanding interview, interrogation and confession isn’t just an intellectual matter — the serious ramifications that emerge from a lack of knowledge can literally be a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>The pandemic has left millions of people across the United States unemployed. But survey data show that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2378023120947997">women have been particularly hard-hit</a>, researchers report in the August <em>Socius.</em> Those gender disparities largely persisted even when the researchers zoomed in on households where men and women both held jobs that could be completed at home.</p>



<p>“Life got harder for everybody, but it got a lot harder for women than it did for men,” says William Scarborough, a sociologist at the University of North Texas in Denton.</p>

<p>Scarborough and colleagues compared U.S. Census Bureau surveys on labor market trends for married heterosexual couples from February and April, the months just before and after stay-at-home orders began. While unemployment increased for all groups, women with no kids were the hardest hit, with unemployment increasing from 2 percent in February to 13.6 percent in April. Comparatively, men with no kids saw unemployment rise from 2.2 percent to 9.5 percent.</p>





<p>Among women with children ages 1 to 12, unemployment increased from about 2 to 3 percent in February to about 12 to 13 percent in April — an increase of 8.9 to 11 percentage points. For men with children in that age range, unemployment rose to between 9 and 10 percent in April, up 7.3 percentage points.</p>

<h3>Gender divide</h3>



<p>Stay-at-home orders in March due to the coronavirus pandemic triggered widespread unemployment in the United States. Census data show that women fared worse than men, and women without children and those with young school-age children were hit especially hard.</p>

<p>And almost 250,000 more mothers than fathers with children in this age range left the workforce altogether and did not seek new jobs, the researchers estimate.</p>



<p>Disparities persisted even when both parents of young children worked in jobs that allowed telecommuting, with mothers reducing their hours more than fathers.  </p>



<p>Women have been walloped for several reasons, Scarborough says. The U.S. workforce is heavily segregated by sex — women are concentrated in service and care jobs requiring face-to-face contact. And with daycare and school closures, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27660">mothers have shouldered more childcare and homeschooling responsibilities</a> than fathers.</p>



<p>Women’s economic pain from the pandemic could last a lifetime through lost earnings and less potential for job advancement, Scarborough says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-primates-apes-gibbon-tooth">A stray molar is the oldest known fossil from an ancient gibbon</a></h4>

<p>While searching for primate fossils in northern India, paleontologist Christopher Gilbert noticed something small and shiny poking out of the dirt. It turned out to be a roughly 13-million-year-old molar from a small-bodied ape related to modern gibbons.</p>



<p>The tooth is the oldest known fossil from a gibbon ancestor, says Gilbert, of Hunter College at the City University of New York. He and colleagues assigned the fossil, which was eroding out of previously dated sediment at a site called Ramnagar, to a new genus and species, <em>Kapi ramnagarensis</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img alt="photo of a browned, ancient tooth" class="wp-image-3091245" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090820_bb_gibbon_inline-590x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091245">This roughly 13-million-year-old molar tooth (shown from above) was found in India and is the oldest known fossil from a gibbon ancestor.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091245">C. Gilbert</span></figure></div>



<p>Until now, the oldest remains of an ancient gibbon species consisted of a small number of teeth found in China, which date from around 7 million to 9 million years ago. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/petite-primate-fossil-could-upend-ideas-about-ape-evolution">Possibly older fossils of a gibbonlike creature</a> are controversial (<em>SN: 10/29/15</em>). Genetic studies of living primates have suggested that gibbon ancestors emerged by at least 20 million years ago in Africa.</p>



<p>After finding the Ramnagar molar in 2015, Gilbert’s team compared it with corresponding teeth of living and extinct apes and monkeys. Features including low, rounded cusps on the edges of the chewing surface <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1655">link the ancient tooth to modern gibbons</a> and the gibbon predecessor in China, the scientists report September 9 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p><em>K. ramnagarensis</em> comes from deposits that previously yielded fossils of an orangutan ancestor, suggesting to Gilbert that both apes reached South Asia from Africa around the same time. “We’re catching a window into that event” as small-bodied gibbons and large-bodied orangutans headed to their recent and current home ranges in East and Southeast Asia, he says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbirds-black-metaltail-cold-torpor">This hummingbird survives cold nights by nearly freezing itself solid</a></h4>

<p>The high Andes mountains of Peru are a hummingbird’s paradise, rich in wildflower nectar and low in predators. But there’s one problem: the cold.</p>



<p>Nighttime temperatures often dip below freezing in these rainy tropical highlands. How does a six-gram bird that needs nectar from 500 flowers a day just to survive get enough extra energy to keep itself warm all night? </p>



<p>It doesn’t. </p>



<p>Instead, as temperatures drop with the sun, these hummingbirds enter a state of suspended animation known as torpor. One species, the black metaltail (<em>Metallura phoebe</em>), <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0428">chills to 3.26° Celsius</a>, the coldest body temperature ever recorded in a bird or non-hibernating mammal, researchers report September 9 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>





<p>“They’re cold as a rock,” says Blair Wolf, a physiological ecologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. “If you didn’t know better you’d think they were dead.” Cooling to near-death temperatures lets the hummingbirds save precious energy, allowing them to survive the cold night and gear up to feed the next day, Wolf says.</p>



<p>Torpor had been observed before in hummingbirds, but Wolf and his colleagues wanted a more detailed picture. They placed 26 individuals of six different species in cages overnight and inserted the equivalent of miniature rectal thermometers into their cloacas. </p>



<p>Perched and upright, the birds pointed their bills upwards, fluffed their feathers and stopped moving. All of the species entered some kind of torpor, but the black metaltail cooled the most, dropping from a daytime temperature of about 40° C to just above freezing. </p>



<p>During the day, these hummingbirds’ tiny-yet-mighty hearts can beat 1,200 times a minute to power their frenetic lifestyle. But during torpor, their heart rates plummet to as low as 40 beats a minute. “It’s an astounding drop,” Wolf says, and it could allow these high-altitude birds to cut their energy use by about 95 percent. By not wasting energy trying to stay warm, these birds can thrive as high as 5,000 meters above sea level. “It’s a remarkable adaptation.”</p>



<p>Around sunrise, the hummingbirds start revving up, warming about a degree a minute by vibrating their muscles. “You see the bird quivering there, then all the sudden its eyes pop open and it’s ready to go,” Wolf says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Finishing off a big task can be memorable, whether you sincerely feel you’ve achieved something or are just relieved to have got it out of the way. Everyday tasks, however, are much more mundane: taking your daily medication or typing in a password are unlikely to be particularly noteworthy events.</p>



<p>You may also have found a gap between your <em>intention</em> to do a particular mundane task and actually enacting it — meaning you either can’t remember whether you actually did it, or misremember having done it entirely. It’s this phenomenon that Dolores Albarracin and colleagues from the University of Illinois explore for the first time in a new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220929203">paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. </p>


<p><span id="more-40236"></span></p>


<p>In the first part of the study, participants played the part of a manager reviewing applications to model for a clothing brochure. In some cases, participants were asked whether they wanted to hire the applicant immediately; in others, they were asked to state whether they <em>intended</em> to hire the applicant later; and in a control condition, were asked to state whether the gender listed in a form about the applicant matched the gender of their photo.</p>



<p>After a brief break, participants saw each applicant again and indicated whether or not they had made a final hire decision in the previous part of the study. As anticipated, participants were more likely to mistakenly believe they had already hired (or rejected) applicants in the “intention” condition than those in the control condition — suggesting that we sometimes mistake having intended to do something with having actually done it.</p>



<p>Next, using the same process, the team showed that  this effect was more pronounced when there are physical similarities between behaviour and intention — in short, when doing something and intending to do something feel or look the same.</p>



<p>Participants in the high similarity condition pressed a key on their keyboard for both the “behaviour” (the definite hiring decisions) and “intention”  (the intended hiring decisions), while those in the low similarity condition enacted <em>behaviour</em> with a keystroke but <em>intention</em> mentally, simply thinking about their intention rather than logging it.</p>



<p>Those in the high similarity condition were more likely to confuse intention with behaviour than those in the low similarity condition, indicating that a similarity in expression may increase the odds of falsely remembering having completed a task (opening an email you intend to respond to later, for example, rather than leaving it unread or adding it to a to do list, may make you more likely to misremember having sent your response).</p>



<p>In the next study, participants judged some candidates by attractiveness and others by competence. As before, participants used these criteria to either register their intention to do something or actually enact behaviour.  Again, intentions were misreported as enactments far more than the other way around; similarly, misreports were far more likely within the same hiring criteria than in a different one (i.e. an intention to hire based on attractiveness was more likely to be misremembered as having actually hired the candidate based on attractiveness than as having actually hired them based on competence). As in the keystroke study, this suggests that similarities in the cognitive processes involved in behaviour and intentions are a key part of mistaken beliefs.</p>



<p>Mistaking intentions for behaviours, even for mundane actions, is not insignificant. Small acts  can be important in many areas of our life: the actual act of taking medication, for instance, may be routine and uninteresting, but its impact is often far from it. Results from this study suggest, however, that it’s something we may frequently misremember doing because the physical actions are so samey.</p>



<p>Results from a final study may indicate a fairly useful — and pretty simple — solution to the problem of misremembering behaviours: active monitoring. Participants who physically wrote down their final hiring decision or their intention to hire were less likely to misremember what they’d done. Writing things down or checking them off a list might not be failsafe — and it might not be very exciting itself — but it could be a good way to ensure that things are getting done.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-butterfly-marine-snail-shells-swim">Sea butterflies’ shells determine how the snails swim</a></h4>

<p>Sea butterflies flit through the ocean on gossamer wings, each species with a style of its own.</p>



<p>These tiny marine snails, or thecosomes, migrate up to surface waters at night to feed and sink to deeper waters during the day to hide from predators. But exactly how they move through the water has remained a mystery, as these delicate creatures survive only a couple days in captivity.</p>



<p>New videos of sea butterflies in an aquarium reveal that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.556239/abstract">snail species swim and sink at different angles and speeds</a>, depending on the sizes and shapes of their shells, researchers report online September 7 in <em>Frontiers in Marine Science</em>. The finding could help biologists better understand marine snail migration, and inspire new designs for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-fish-shows-how-deepest-vertebrate-sea-takes-pressure">underwater robots</a> (<em>SN: 1/3/18</em>).</p>



<p>Mechanical engineer David Murphy of the University of South Florida in Tampa and colleagues videotaped seven species of sea butterflies collected off Bermuda. The catch included two tiny species with coiled shells about 1 millimeter across, four midsize species with long, conical or urn-shaped shells of about 7 to 11 millimeters, and one species with a flat shell up to 14 millimeters across.</p>





<p>“It’s pretty remarkable how graceful the motion of their wings is,” Murphy says. “Just really beautiful to watch.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Sea butterflies are marine snails that propel themselves through water with a pair of winglike appendages. “They come in this dazzling array of sizes and shapes,” says David Murphy, a mechanical engineer at the University of South Florida in Tampa. New videos taken by Murphy and colleagues reveal the unique swimming styles of sea butterflies with different shell shapes.</figure>



<p>All the sea butterfly species propelled themselves along zigzagging paths as they flapped their wings. Those wingbeats also caused bodies of the tiny, coiled shell species and the midsize, long shell snails to rock back and forth as they swam.</p>



<p>Snails with coiled or elongated shells tended to swim straight up, and to sink straight down whenever they stopped flapping, their shells hanging like pendulums beneath their wings. But the species with a wide, flat shell, <em>Diacria trispinosa</em>, climbed at a shallower angle and drifted sideways as it sank, potentially due to lift generated by its shell.</p>



<p>Bigger, stronger snails also swam faster — with <em>D. trispinosa</em> cruising at an average 84 millimeters per second, while the tiniest coiled shell snails, <em>Heliconoides inflatus </em>and<em> Limacina bulimoides</em>, averaged about 27 millimeters per second. But for coiled shell critters only about a millimeter long, that’s still a pretty impressive pace.</p>

<p>The emergency pivot to remote learning for K–12 students last spring illuminated longstanding educational fault lines in the United States. The most vulnerable students — children with disabilities, English language learners and children from marginalized Black, Hispanic and Native American communities — were less likely than their affluent and mostly white peers to have basic necessities such as regular meals, a quiet place to work, computer access, guidance on how to get online and even online access itself.</p>



<p>Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, education researchers were sounding the alarm that the country’s achievement gap between students from low- and high-income households had remained unchanged for almost half a century, with the poorest students <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/learning-gap-rich-poor-students-remains-high">performing at academic levels three to four years below</a> that of the wealthiest students (<em>SN: </em><em>3/19/19</em>).</p>



<p>Spring’s events may have pushed disadvantaged students even further behind. In a May working paper, researchers at Brown University in Providence, R.I., used typical rates of learning loss that occur over summer vacation to estimate learning losses incurred by spring school closures. Their calculations suggest that students, on average, will return to school this fall having retained only about a third to half of the math skills acquired during a normal school year, and 63 to 68 percent of their reading skills. But those <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-226">learning losses are uneven</a>, with readers in the top third proficiency level potentially even accelerating their rate of learning during school closures.</p>



<p>This fall, with COVID-19 still surging throughout the country, many schools are reopening either entirely online, or with an online–in person hybrid schedule. Assuming full in-person instruction does not resume until January 2021, global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that the students may fall behind nearly seven months on average. For white students, the average is six months. In comparison, Hispanic students would be set back more than nine months, Black students more than 10 months, and low-income students, over a year. Overall, existing racial and socioeconomic <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime">achievement gaps could expand by 15 to 20 percent</a>, the group estimates. Education researchers fear that students who suffered the greatest learning losses in the spring may never catch up.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Widening the gap</h3>



<p>Research shows that virtual learning in K–12 schools this fall could widen preexisting achievement gaps in education. The global consulting company McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that if schools continue remote online learning until January 2021, Black, Hispanic and poor students will be set back at least nine months of education on average compared with average losses of six months for white students.  </p>

<p>“There were gaps before. Now they’re wider,” says education economist Douglas Harris of Tulane University in New Orleans. “A great accomplishment, unfortunately, would be to get back to where they were before this pandemic started.”</p>



<p>In an open letter that has now garnered around 500 signatures from education experts around the country, Harris and Katharine Strunk of Michigan State University in East Lansing outlined <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pi-u7TJVIMVPIaGZ9QhJuT9VJ6URuvW3ki8diELwf7o/edit">seven focus areas for helping the country’s most vulnerable students</a>. A<a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/07/28/7-research-based-recommendations-for-what-schools-should.html"> version of the letter</a> appeared in <em>Education Week. </em>Topping the list were state- and federal-level asks: A massive infusion of funds to stave off looming school budget cuts and provision of computer and internet access for all students. The other items focus on what schools can do with those resources.</p>





<p>But with large-scale government assistance unlikely, school districts have to figure out what they can do on shoestring budgets, using best available evidence. Solutions include boosting technology access for students, leveraging low-tech, community-based efforts, tutoring and special provisions for the youngest learners.</p>



<h4>Bridging the digital divide</h4>



<p>Best estimates suggest that 10 to 20 percent of students lacked access to devices such as tablets or computers, the internet or both, during the spring shift to online instruction. Hispanic, Black, low-income and rural students were most likely to lack access. An April survey from the Washington, D.C.–based Pew Research Center found that some 43 percent of low-income students would <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/04/30/53-of-americans-say-the-internet-has-been-essential-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/">likely have to complete their homework on a cell phone</a>.</p>



<p>Some school districts quickly mobilized to bridge that digital divide. In Guilford County, N.C., where over 66 percent of the district’s 71,000-plus students live in poverty, two local nonprofits joined forces to purchase laptops for thousands of students. Additionally, the district used money from the CARES Act, a federal coronavirus relief fund, to buy almost 80,000 devices for students, staff and teachers for fall. But back orders nationwide mean half the items might arrive late, a school spokesperson says.</p>

<p>In May, and again this fall, the district rolled out “smart” buses with Wi-Fi hot spots in areas without reliable internet access. Each of the 125 buses can support 65 simultaneous connections, with the signal extending over 90 meters. The $1,000 apiece price tag to outfit the buses was covered by a grant from Chiefs for Change, a bipartisan group of school leaders headquartered in Washington, D.C.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Guilford County smart bus with wi-fi" class="wp-image-3091152" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline2_680-677x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091152">The shift to online learning in spring due to COVID-19 meant that students needed to watch classes online. Many students in North Carolina’s Guilford County schools lacked internet access so the district rolled out “smart” buses capable of supporting 65 simultaneous connections. Here, a school employee tests the setup.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091152">Chris English/Tigermoth Creative</span></figure>



<p>Other districts have received support from state and local governments. City leaders joined Chicago Public Schools and philanthropic groups in creating Chicago Connected, a $50 million initiative to provide 100,000 students with free high-speed internet for four years. Over 18,000 students had signed up before fall classes started.</p>



<p>Beyond internet access, just taking steps to make sure students show up online has helped ensure access. Leaders in Florida’s Miami-Dade County Public Schools experienced with unpredictable school closures thanks to hurricanes, went door-to-door with the help of local police and community partners to check on absent students and provide them with devices and hot spots.</p>



<p>Guilford and Miami-Dade reported that in some weeks, over 90 percent of students logged on to classes, though average attendance trended lower. Even the basic act of taking attendance sets those districts apart, says Bree Dusseault, an education researcher at the Seattle-based Center for Reinventing Public Education, a nonpartisan public school reform research group affiliated with the University of Washington Bothell. Among the more than 100 schools — serving almost 10 million students — in the center’s database, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WLwHgQvoWT1op6RALANmwOE7akFfDEJGbKLeXEQnEes/edit">only a third of districts tracked attendance</a>.</p>



<p>What works in urban and suburban districts <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2020/08/10/rural-school-districts-can-be-creative-in-solving-the-internet-connectivity-gap-but-they-need-support/">doesn’t always translate well to rural areas</a> without high-speed internet infrastructure, according to a report from the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. In those cases, lower-tech workarounds can help students keep up. One Ohio district uploaded videos onto USB drives and hand-delivered them to students. Elsewhere, teachers called students on the phone to check on their progress.</p>



<h4>Pandemic pods, community education and tutoring</h4>



<p>Some parents have banded together in so-called pandemic pods to teach their kids, sometimes with the help of a paid tutor or teacher. This model has attracted media attention in part because of its potential to worsen inequities, since not everyone can afford to hire an educator.</p>



<p>But single mom Yenda Prado has a positive outlook on pods, which she first experienced during summer visits to her grandmother’s village in Mexico. There, community pods formed for exchanging services such as English lessons and housekeeping.</p>



<p>“When families and communities are in crisis, that’s when they come together to pool and share resources,” says Prado, a fifth-year doctoral student in education at the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="school pod in California due to COVID-19" class="wp-image-3091153" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline3_680-670x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091153">After the pivot to online learning in March due to the novel coronavirus, single mom and education researcher Yenda Prado, of the University of California, Irvine, created a small learning group, or pod, with her son (far right) and some of his classmates. Now she is working to create pods within area K–12 schools.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091153">Kathleen Adler</span></figure>



<p>She created a pilot pod with her 9-year-old son and some classmates in June, and is assessing how to scale up that setup through her affiliation with the Orange County Educational Advancement Network, or OCEAN. The consortium encompasses some area K–12 schools, various nonprofits and UC Irvine. Prado’s goal is to connect small groups of students at OCEAN’s affiliate schools with undergraduate “fellows.” Those fellows will receive service or field study credit for their work, or simply volunteer. Fellows can provide academic support, but their main role is facilitating member bonding and community building. “That is what’s missing from the educational landscape right now,” Prado says.</p>



<p>Such strengthening of ties between community organizations and schools could present a chance for educators to make learning resonate with students of all backgrounds. Research shows, for instance, that when curriculum is made ethnically relevant for students, <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/my-brother%E2%80%99s-keeper-impact-targeted-educational-supports">dropout rates go down and grades and attendance go up</a>.  Even when such programs exist outside of school, such as through community-run after-school programs, they can <a href="https://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=21990">help students integrate what they’re learning at school with their lived experiences</a>. </p>



<p>“This moment … as sad as it is, I think it’s a great opportunity for education to not only be reclaimed by communities, but for schools to recognize that they’re not the only places of learning and development, and they have to be able to do this together,” says community-based education researcher Bianca Baldridge of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<p>Community and faith-based organizations and local funders in Indianapolis rose to the occasion by creating a learning hub that gives priority to students who struggled with low attendance in the spring, and those experiencing homelessness. And San Francisco’s Parks and Recreation Department is partnering with area nonprofits to provide 6,000 childcare spots for children in grades K–6, with priority given to students in greatest need.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, districts are pursuing tutoring models to provide personalized in-person or remote academic support. Just over a tenth of districts in the Center for Reinventing Public Education’s database are looking into such plans, Dusseault says. The Los Angeles Unified School District, which is all-online this fall, is providing 500 K–8 students with free tutors, who are volunteers with a group called Step Up Tutoring.</p>



<p>Matching struggling students with tutors 1-to-1 or 2-to-1 is a surefire way to help close opportunity gaps, says Matthew Kraft, a Brown University education economics researcher. Tutoring works best during the school day, he has found. A July working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27476.pdf">substantial learning gains among participants in 96 programs</a> lasting 10 weeks to a year, with mostly low, often 1-to-1, student-tutor ratios. A nationwide tutoring corps could be rolled out by expanding Americorps, a federally funded national service program, Kraft and others suggest.</p>



<h4>Prioritizing in-person learning for younger children</h4>



<p>For the youngest students, in-person instruction makes sense from both public health and education standpoints.</p>



<p>For reasons that are not entirely clear, younger children appear <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks">less likely than older children and adults to transmit the virus</a> that causes COVID-19 (<em>SN: </em><em>8/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>In a July policy brief, education researchers Kathleen Lynch of Brown University and Heather Hill of Harvard University point to<a href="https://annenberg.brown.edu/sites/default/files/EdResearch_for_Recovery_Brief_6.pdf"> multiple lines of evidence supporting in-person instruction for younger students</a>. Learning growth rates are substantially higher in grades K–2 than in later grades, and failure to understand the building blocks of numeracy and literacy in those early years can lead to academic difficulties later.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="young children wearing masks in school due to COVID-19" class="wp-image-3091154" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline4_680-675x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091154">Virtual learning is especially hard for elementary school–age children, researchers say. As such, many districts across the United States are working to bring the youngest children into physical classrooms before older students.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091154">FatCamera//E+/Getty Images</span></figure>



<p>In addition, very young students do not generally possess the attention and self-regulation skills needed for all-online instruction. Even when those students have computers and internet access, online classes remain a challenge, says Chris Curran, an education policy expert at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Young children can’t reasonably be expected to pay attention to online classes for hours on end, or complete simple tasks, such as writing their name on a piece of paper, without adult assistance.</p>



<p>Some school districts are trying to bring younger kids into physical classrooms before older kids. For instance, Kansas City Public Schools will start entirely online September 8, but if the city sees a 14-day decline in COVID-19 cases and city health officials OK school reopening, youngsters in grades K–3 can return in person full-time. After another 14-day decline, students in grades 4 to 8 can return part-time.</p>



<p>When opening in person is just not an option, Curran says districts must adapt to younger students’ needs, such as by handing out art project materials. “Technology can’t be the only solution, particularly for really young students,” he says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s one of the best-known and also controversial experiments in psychology: in 1963, Stanley Milgram reported that, when instructed, many people are surprisingly willing to deliver apparently dangerous electrical shocks to others. For some researchers, this — along with follow-up studies by the team — reveals how acting “under orders” can undermine our moral compass.</p>



<p>Milgram’s interpretation of his findings, and the methods, too, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">have been criticised</a>. However, the results have largely been replicated in experiments run in <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/news-and-media">the US</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/">Poland</a>, and elsewhere. And in 2016, a brain-scanning study revealed that when we perform an act under coercion vs freely, our brain processes it more like a passive action rather than a voluntary one.</p>



<p>Now a new study, from a group that specialises in the neuroscience of empathy, takes this further: Emilie Caspar at the Social Brain Lab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and colleagues report in <em>NeuroImage</em> that when we follow orders to hurt someone, there is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307370?via=ihub">reduced activity in brain networks involved in our ability to feel another’s pain</a>. What’s more, this leads us to perceive pain that we inflict as being less severe. This process could, then, help to explain the dark side of obedience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40226"></span></p>


<p>Most of the 40 participants recruited for the new work were women, and their average age was about 25. None knew each other before arriving at the lab, where they were studied in gender-matched pairs. Within each pair, one person was randomly chosen to first be the “agent”, and the other the “victim” (they would later switch roles). The agent was taken to an MRI scanner in one room, while the victim was seated in another, electrodes attached to their hand. While in the scanner, the agent could see a live video of the victim’s hand, so they could observe the (genuine) impact of their actions.</p>



<p>The task itself was split into four blocks of 30 trials each. During two of the blocks, the agent was told “you can decide” whether or not to press a button to inflict a mildly painful electrical shock to the victim. During the other two blocks, half the time they were given the instruction “Shock”, and half the time “No Shock”. Each shock the agent gave was “rewarded” with €0.05.</p>



<p>The team found that, on average, people were less likely to administer a shock when it was up to them. (Still, the number of shocks was not negligible: an average of 23 out of the 60 “you decide” trials vs 30 of the 60 instructed trials. Statistically, there’s a significant difference between the two figures, but there clearly isn’t a chasm.)</p>



<p>Caspar and her colleagues used the brain imaging data to look closely at three distinct patterns of activity: the “vicarious pain signature” (associated with feeling other people’s pain); the “neurologic pain signature” (associated with experiencing pain directly) and the “interpersonal guilt signature” (observable when we feel guilt over a harmful impact on another person). The team found that when someone was obeying orders to administer a shock, rather than choosing to do so, both the vicarious pain signature and the interpersonal guilt signature were less intense.</p>



<p>Tallying with the brain imaging results, the participants reported feeling less bad, and less sorry, about inflicting pain when acting under orders — and they reported that these shocks looked less severe on the video. As the researchers note, this was despite the fact that the participants had been told the shocks would always be of the same intensity. “Obeying orders has such a strong influence on the perception of pain felt by others that it even impacts perceptual reports of observed shock intensity,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>All in all, the results imply that when we’re acting under orders to hurt someone, we don’t find it as personally unpleasant as when we hurt someone freely. Part of the reason we normally don’t hurt other people is because we’d feel at least some of their pain ourselves, but when obeying orders this vicarious response is reduced — so we’re more likely to harm them.</p>



<p>The team argues that a sense of responsibility and/or agency (feeling that we are the author of our own actions) is key: when these are reduced, so too is our empathy for pain that we inflict, with potentially dire results. The results “highlight how obeying an order relaxes our aversion against harming others, despite still being the author of the action that led to the pain,” they write.</p>



<p>But why might this happen? Is there something more fundamental going on?</p>



<p>Remember that in this study — as in other similar studies — the participants were acting under the clear orders of an authority figure with an electric shock machine at their disposal. As for all living things, our prime directives are to survive and thrive. Imagine in the real world being ordered by someone in authority to harm another person. You might recognise (even unconsciously) that your choice is either to obey, or disobey and risk being hurt yourself — either physically, or in terms of your career. An evolved ability to dial down your empathy for someone else’s pain in such a situation could be of benefit to you.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gerrymandering-elections-next-gen-computer-generated-maps">How next-gen computer generated maps detect partisan gerrymandering</a></h4>

<p>In October 2019, a state court determined that North Carolina’s congressional districts had been severely gerrymandered and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/2019-10-28-Harper%20v_%20Lewis-Order.pdf">struck down the state’s map</a>. The court’s ruling was informed, in part, by tens of thousands of alternative maps demonstrating that the district boundaries had very likely been manipulated for political gain, the very definition of gerrymandering.</p>



<p>Researchers had generated a slew of alternative, computer-generated maps designed to help identify potential patterns of bias. The approach is increasingly used, alongside other tests, to ferret out alleged gerrymandering. District manipulations can be so subtle that they’re undetectable just by looking at them. “The eyeball test is no good,” says Jonathan Katz, a political scientist and statistician at Caltech.</p>



<p>U.S. states redraw their district lines every 10 years to adjust for changing demographics picked up by the national census. The last round a decade ago raised eyebrows, most notably for districts drawn in Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>“The post-2010 round of redistricting is widely viewed as a time of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12744">extreme, even egregious, partisan gerrymandering</a>,” retired political scientist Richard Engstrom wrote in the January 2020 <em>Social Science Quarterly</em>.</p>





<p>A 2017 report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that existing congressional maps were largely biased in favor of the Republican Party. In 26 states, which account for 85 percent of U.S. congressional districts, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Extreme Maps 5.16_0.pdf">as many as 17 Republicans in the House of Representatives owe their seats to gerrymandering</a>. In states where Democrats controlled the redistricting process, partisan bias is also a problem, but the effect is smaller because those states are often made up of fewer districts.</p>



<p>Since 2011, legal scholars, political scientists and mathematicians conducting gerrymandering research have served as expert witnesses in more than 250 state and federal court cases regarding redistricting.</p>



<p>With the 2020 U.S. census now under way, legislators will soon be revising electoral districts again. This time around, researchers hope that instead of serving as expert witnesses in court, they can help identify problematic districting before the new maps even go into effect.</p>



<p>“In 2010, the politicians were thinking very hard on how to draw maps,” while the public and academics weren’t paying a lot of attention, says Jon Eguia, an applied game theorist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. “So in 2011, [those politicians] drew a lot of very bad maps in very many states. Now we’re all paying attention.”</p>



<h4>Measuring bias</h4>



<p>According to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a state’s voting districts must each contain about the same number of people and be drawn in a way that doesn’t disenfranchise racial or ethnic minorities. States can have additional rules, such as contiguity of districts or that cities or counties be kept intact.</p>



<p>That leaves two main tactics for gerrymandering: “packing” the opposing political party’s supporters into a few districts in hopes your party dominates the rest, or “cracking” these supporters by spreading them across many districts to dilute their collective voting power. Those skilled in gerrymandering draw district boundaries that ensure decade-long protection for the ruling party.  </p>



<p>Early methods to test a state map for gerrymandering, which are still in use today, rely on a concept known as partisan symmetry. If a map provides symmetric, or equal, opportunity for all parties in a contest to convert votes into seats, that map is deemed fair. States with packed and cracked districts won’t pass tests based on symmetry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Puzzle power </h3>



<p>The party that controls the maps can grab power through packing or cracking. In packing, politicians cram voters from the opposing party into just a few districts, securing the remaining districts for their own party. The blue ruling party created one all-red district, and three majority blue districts. In cracking, politicians spread voters from the opposing party across districts, blocking them from gaining a majority. The ruling red party split up blue voters at the “city center” to create three reliably red districts.</p>

<p>Symmetry-based tests gained prominence after<em> LULAC v. Perry</em>, a 2006 Supreme Court case that reviewed a mid-decade redistricting plan in Texas. In that case, scientists entered into evidence a partisan bias test — a simulation of what would have happened in an election if the parties’ vote shares were reversed. For instance, if Party A wins 10 out of 15 seats with 70 percent of the vote in an actual election, then Party B, in a hypothetical election, should win 10 seats if it had 70 percent of the vote. Deviation from that “symmetry” equals the level of partisan bias.</p>



<p>In <em>LULAC</em>, the justices largely upheld Texas’ map. But the court indicated willingness to use a symmetry-based method in a future case, though perhaps not solely the partisan bias test. Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concerns about that particular test, saying it was unclear how much bias was too much. Kennedy also questioned the method’s reliance on statistical simulations rather than real-world results. “We are wary of adopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs,” he wrote in the plurality opinion for <em>LULAC</em>.</p>



<h4>Real-world symmetry</h4>



<p>Kennedy’s feedback on <em>LULAC</em> prompted researchers to develop other symmetry-based tests that used actual election results.</p>



<p>One such approach is the median-mean difference test. That test arises from the basic statistical principle that the difference between the median and the mean indicates the level of skew in the data, with values closer to zero less skewed and vice versa. In 2015 in the <em>Election Law Journal</em>, political scientists Michael McDonald and Robin Best of Binghamton University in New York explained how a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/McDonald_Best_Unfair_Gerrymanders_2015.pdf">median-mean analysis could help identify partisan skew in a state</a>.</p>



<p>A party’s mean vote share comes from averaging vote shares across all districts in a state. A party’s median vote share comes from the district in the middle of a distribution, with the party’s worst-performing district in terms of vote share at one end and the best-performing district at the other. If the difference between a party’s median and mean vote shares is high, that indicates a possibly biased skew, though McDonald and Best noted that some natural skew is inevitable and must be factored into any analysis.</p>



<p>Another approach is called the <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol82/iss2/4/">efficiency gap</a>, which measures the difference in packing and cracking between parties by tallying “wasted” votes. So, if Party A draws an electoral map that spreads Party B’s voters across districts, votes cast for Candidate B in districts won by A are wasted. Conversely, if Party A packs Party B’s voters into a few districts, votes cast for Candidate B beyond the majority needed to win are also wasted. Each party should have about the same number of wasted votes in an election. So the efficiency gap, first described in 2015 in the<em> University of Chicago Law Review</em>, is calculated by taking the difference in wasted votes between parties and dividing that by the total number of votes cast.</p>



<p>PlanScore, a nonpartisan group of legal, political and mapping experts, has shown <a href="https://planscore.org/north_carolina/#!2012-plan-ushouse-pb">how the various symmetry tests can be used in tandem</a> to flag possible gerrymandering. In its analysis of the congressional map used in North Carolina’s 2018 congressional elections, where Republicans won 10 seats and Democrats three, PlanScore found bias using all three tests: The partisan bias test showed that in a hypothetical, tied election, Republicans would win 26.9 percent extra seats. In the median-mean test, the median Republican vote share was 5.8 percent higher than its mean vote share. And the efficiency gap was 27.7 percent in favor of Republicans.</p>





<h4>Natural advantage</h4>



<p>Critics of symmetry-based tests, though, say that the presence of packing and cracking does not prove that the governing party has intentionally gerrymandered the state’s districts. Instead, asymmetries can also arise from natural variations in where voters live. Crucially, Republicans tend to be more dispersed across states while Democrats are concentrated in cities.</p>



<p>“The party that’s more spread out has a geographic advantage,” says applied mathematician Jonathan Mattingly of Duke University. “That’s our system.”</p>



<p>Tests that have emerged over the last few years, known broadly as ensemble methods, accept that natural advantage. These tests rely on computers to generate thousands, or even millions, of possible maps. The programs draw myriad boundary lines around a given district and estimate which party would win that district under each scenario.</p>



<p>Consider a state in which one party wins four to seven seats in almost all maps generated, while the state is using a map that regularly gives that party nine seats, Eguia says. That discrepancy suggests partisan gerrymandering.</p>



<p>Lawyers working on gerrymandering cases tend to use ensemble and symmetry methods in tandem, says Ruth Greenwood, an attorney in Cambridge, Mass., with PlanScore and the nonpartisan nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. That’s because each alternative map can also be evaluated for symmetry using the various tests. Averaging symmetry scores in the ensemble maps and comparing those values with the symmetry scores of the real-life map can illuminate when the difference is stark and therefore can’t be chalked up to any “natural advantage.”</p>



<p>Using all methods together also means that when a map’s fairness is questioned, the lawyers can show that “on any metric, the result is terrible,” Greenwood says.</p>



<h4>States at the helm</h4>



<p>The issue of gerrymandering was weaving through the federal courts until June 2019, when the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in <em>Rucho v. Common Cause </em>that partisan gerrymandering fell outside federal jurisdiction. The decision was in response to an appeal challenging a federal court’s January 2018 ruling that North Carolina’s congressional district map had been gerrymandered along partisan lines, giving Republicans 10 out of 13 seats in 2016 and 2018, despite the fact that in both elections Republicans won only about half the popular vote.</p>



<p>By removing the federal court system from gerrymandering cases, the Supreme Court left the issue to the states, a charge a North Carolina state court quickly took up in<em> Harper v. Lewis</em>. The state court relied on much of the same evidence presented in <em>Rucho</em>. That evidence included testimony by Mattingly showing that in a universe with 24,518 alternative congressional district maps, the map North Carolina was using was an egregious outlier. In the maps Mattingly generated, Republicans carried 10 or more seats less than 1 percent of the time.</p>



<p>In October 2019, the three-judge panel in the <em>Harper</em> case ruled that state lawmakers needed to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/2019-10-28-Harper%20v_%20Lewis-Order.pdf">redraw the congressional district map for 2020</a>. Plaintiffs, however, then challenged the state’s remedial map, which would likely result in Republicans winning eight out of 13 seats. Mattingly <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/files/2019/12/Mattingly-Nov.-26-Declaration.pdf">again provided expert testimony</a>, this time adding 57,202 more maps made using less stringent constraints than the first batch. His research showed a much more purple state, with a 7–6 or 6–7 party split arising in the majority of those alternative maps.</p>



<p>But with the state’s 2020 primary fast approaching, a state court approved the remedial map in December 2019. That new map will stand for only a short time, though. Along with every other state, North Carolina will go through redistricting again in 2021 after the census tallies are in. New Jersey and Virginia — which hold statewide elections in odd years — may struggle to finish their maps before the 2021 elections, since the census was delayed due to the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Slightly fairer </h3>



<p>For the last decade, Republican legislators in North Carolina have strategically packed and cracked Democratic voters across congressional districts, limiting their voting power. A state court struck down the maps from 2016 and 2018 that created only three Democratic-leaning districts (blue). The 2020 map creates two more blue-leaning districts, but researchers say the new map still gives Republicans an extra one or two seats. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, census watchers worry that the Trump administration’s recent decision to move the completion deadline for the population count from October 31 to September 30 could lead to undercounts among hard-to-reach groups, thereby affecting the placement of district boundaries.</p>



<p>Greenwood expects a spike in lawsuits, though now at the state rather than federal level, challenging the newly drawn maps. And a small cadre of researchers is now ready to serve as expert witnesses in those cases, Eguia says.</p>



<p>The upcoming mapmaking process doesn’t have to repeat the mistakes of a decade ago, he adds. In 2011, lawmakers drew maps largely behind closed doors without researchers present — resulting in a decade of lawsuits, he says. Why not, instead, bring researchers into the room, with their tests and myriad maps, from the get-go? “That’s what the community of experts would prefer,” he says. “That’s what I would advocate for.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Stories about discriminatory practices against Black people with natural hairstyles (e.g. afros, twists, dreadlocks, braids and cornrows) abound. At school, having natural hair has led to detention, punishment and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/black-pupils-excluded-hair-discrimination-equality-act">exclusions</a>, and previous <a href="https://perception.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TheGood-HairStudyFindingsReport.pdf">research</a> has also found serious stigma around natural hair when it comes to desirability and professionalism.</p>



<p>A new study in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620937937?journalCode=sppa"><em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em><u> </u></em>backs this up, finding that such biases can tangibly affect Black women’s chances with potential employers. Christy Zhou Koval at Michigan State University and Ashleigh Shelby Rosette at Duke University found that Black women with natural hairstyles were seen as less competent and less professional than White female applicants or Black applicants with straightened hair — and that they were less likely to get job interviews, too.</p>


<p><span id="more-40194"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 480 participants imagined themselves as a recruiter, tasked with evaluating job applicants based on their Facebook profile. The applicants themselves had a wide range of different hairstyles, but fell into one of four groups: White women with curly or straight hair, and Black women with natural or straightened hair. Participants rated each applicant on professionalism and competence, and indicated how likely they would be to select the applicant for an interview.</p>



<p>As expected, Black women with natural hairstyles were rated as less professional and less competent than Black women with straightened hair and White women with both curly and straight hair (though curly-haired White women were ranked as less professional than their straight-haired counterparts). Black women with natural hair were also the group least likely to be recommended for interview.</p>



<p>A second study replicated this process — except this time, participants saw multiple pictures of the same women with different hairstyles. The effect held: Black women were seen as less professional, less competent and less likely to be invited to interview when they were depicted with natural hair.</p>



<p>A further study looked at the role of industry in perception of natural hair. This time, participants were told they were recruiting either for the <em>consulting</em> industry (traditionally more conservative) or the <em>advertising industry </em>(more laidback). In the consulting condition, Black women with natural hair were again considered less professional and less competent and again received fewer recommendations for interview than Black women with straightened hair. In advertising, however, there was no difference in either professionalism or interview recommendations. A further study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>The results highlight the need for an intersectional approach to understanding workplace discrimination. It’s obviously true that women often experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/">extensive</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/">biases</a> at work because of their gender — but these biases can be compounded or experienced in completely different ways by women of colour. The discrimination outlined in this study is certainly not the only kind experienced by Black women — and, as the team notes, other women of colour experience stigma around their appearance too. Headscarves, to use just one example, may also affect hiring practices.     </p>



<p>Future research could look at more natural scenarios — although some employers do look at social media profiles while hiring, examining biases during in-person interviews could provide further insights.</p>



<p>The findings from the second part of the study suggest that differing norms between sectors may play a key part in perpetuating inequality. It follows that addressing such systemic racism is an important part in addressing these sorts of biases. Public policies, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/army-ban-on-dreadlocks-black-servicewomen.html">seen</a> in some parts of the US, may also help to protect Black women from employment discrimination: in four US states, for example, it’s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/virginia-hair-discrimination-ban">illegal to discriminate</a> based on someone’s hairstyle.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that although this study was conducted in an American context, the problem exists across the world — as Irish writer Emma Dabiri points out in her <a href="https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-protect-afro-textured-hair-amend-the-uk-equality-act-to-include-hair">petition</a> to amend the UK Equality Act to include hair discrimination. Research looking at exactly how these biases operate in other countries is key to understanding and tackling such practices.</p>

<p><strong>What can we do to stay connected in the middle of a pandemic? </strong>We’ve all played our part in fighting COVID-19, and for many of us that has meant staying away from our friends and families. In this episode, our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a> explores how this unprecedented period of separation has reinforced the importance of connection. Ginny looks at how video chats compare to in-person interaction, and how psychology could help improve virtual communication in the future. She also examines the importance of touch for reducing stress — and asks whether interactions with our furry friends could make up for a lack of human contact.</p>

The crowd applauded, impressed at this monumental accomplishment. However, recording spike trains from the brains of animals is as old as time. And actually, <i>wireless</i> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902772/" target="_blank">Implantable Neuroprosthetics in Pigs is <i><b>so</b> </i>2011</a>...<sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>2</b></span></sup> <br /><br /><br />The title of this post in TNW said it best:<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/08/31/i-was-excited-for-neuralink-then-i-watched-elon-musks-stupid-demo/" target="_blank">I was excited for Neuralink. Then I watched Elon Musk’s stupid demo</a><br /><blockquote>“Here’s the one fact you need to know: Neuralink's actual device is less capable than similar medical <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/1/2/001/meta" target="_blank" title="brain computer interface">BCI</a>s already on the market. The big claim to fame here is that Neuralink hopes one day to bring this technology to the masses.”</blockquote><br />And really, invasive intracranial technology is likely to obsolete by the time the requisite advances in neural decoding would occur (if ever). As Kording Lab member <a href="http://kordinglab.com/people/ari_benjamin/index.html" target="_blank">Ari Benjamin</a> told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53956683" target="_blank">BBC News</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Once they have the recordings, Neuralink will need to decode them and will someday hit the barrier that is our lack of basic understanding of how the brain works, no matter how many neurons they record from. <br /><br />Decoding goals and movement plans is hard when you don't understand the neural code in which those things are communicated.”</blockquote><br />Another winner in the snark department was MIT Technology Review, with:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/30/1007786/elon-musks-neuralink-demo-update-neuroscience-theater/" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s Neuralink is neuroscience theater</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“...Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide. One difficulty ahead of the company is perfecting microwires that can survive the ‘corrosive’ context of a living brain for a decade. That problem alone could take years to solve. <br /><br />The primary objective of the streamed demo, instead, was to stir excitement, recruit engineers to the company (which already employs about 100 people), and build the kind of fan base that has cheered on Musk’s other ventures...”</blockquote><br />The cult of Musk is indeed cheering, in a rather credulous fashion (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OHcCpt0Ds" target="_blank">Why Neuralink Will Change Humanity Forever</a>).<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>1</b></span></sup> It's actually correct that the representation of the snout in pig somatosensory cortex <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961777/" target="_blank">occupies a disproportionately large portion of the cortex</a>.<br /><br /><sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>2</b></span></sup> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902772/" target="_blank">Borton et al.

<p>This post was written by Nick Shockey and first appeared on <a href="http://openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/2020-theme-announcement-english">openaccessweek.org</a> and has since been reposted on <a href="https://sparcopen.org/">sparcopen.org.</a> Nick is the Director of Programs and Engagement for SPARC.</p>



<p>The 2020 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year’s International Open Access Week, to be held October 19-25, will be “Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion.”</p>



<p>Openness can be a powerful tool for building more equitable systems of sharing knowledge. Rebuilding research and scholarship to be open by default presents a unique opportunity to construct a foundation that is fundamentally more equitable. Yet today, structural racism, discrimination, and exclusion are present and persistent in places where openness is a core value. As a global community, it is important to understand that the systems and spaces of the present are often built upon legacies of historic injustice and that addressing these inequities is a necessity.  </p>



<p>We need to examine who these spaces and systems are designed for, who is missing, who is excluded by the business models we use, and whose interests are prioritized. As we work together to rebuild these structures, we need to commit to moving from conversations to concrete commitments and to hold one another accountable for making real progress.</p>



<p>Building on our discussions in 2018 (“Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge”) and 2019 (“Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge”), 2020 marks the third consecutive year the theme for International Open Access Week will focus on the urgent need for action on equity and inclusion, underscoring the urgency of continuing to center this work.</p>



<p>International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year’s Open Access Week will be held from October 19th through the 25th; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year’s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true for this year with the varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. </p>

Scopus is the world’s largest database of abstracts and citations, and calls itself “comprehensive,” “curated,” and “enriched.” But my recent experience with it suggests its curation could use some work.

<p><strong>Psychologists interested in dreams spend a lot of time analysing dream diaries — but what if they could have a computer do all that laborious work for them? </strong>That’s the promise of a new algorithm that uses text analysis to look for patterns in people’s dream reports, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/new-algorithm-can-find-hidden-patterns-your-dreams">writes Charlotte Hartley</a> at <em>Science</em>. The tool could help researchers understand how dreams differ in different populations, or how the content of dreams relates to wellbeing.<span id="more-40144"></span></p>

<p><strong>Many people who live with eating disorders have experienced an exacerbation of their symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic,</strong> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-era-isolation-is-making-dangerous-eating-disorders-worse/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29">reports Michelle Konstantinovsky</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. There could be many reasons for this, including reduced social support and face-to-face therapy, a lack of structure, and increased feelings of anxiety.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Another study has found that there has been a <em>reduction</em> in anxiety among year nine students in southwest England during lockdown. </strong>While stuck at home, kids may have been protected from aspects of school which negatively affect their wellbeing, such as pressures associated with schoolwork and the need to navigate social relationships, <a href="https://theconversation.com/school-closures-had-positive-effects-on-some-teenagers-mental-health-our-new-research-suggests-144884">writes researcher Emily Widnall</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

<hr />
<p><strong>Finally, acronyms are becoming increasingly common in scientific papers, creating barriers for science communication, </strong><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/science-journals-acronyms-communication/">reports Hannah Seo</a> at <em>Popular Science</em>. Researchers analysed 25 million papers published in the past 70 years, finding that abstracts and titles contained more than 1 million unique acronyms, most of which were only used a handful of times. More recent papers also contained a greater proportion of acronyms. There is clearly a place for acronyms, Seo writes, but overuse can make science less accessible to the public and even to scientists from different fields.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>One of the classic findings in memory research is that we’re better at remembering information when we’re in a similar context to that in which we learned it. This was perhaps most famously demonstrated in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x?saml_referrer">a 1975 study</a>, which found that people who learned a list of words while scuba diving had better memory for the words when again underwater, compared to when on land (similarly, those who had learned the list on land were better at remembering it on land).</p>



<p>But it’s not just the external environment that matters: our internal states can also provide memory cues. For instance, people who were intoxicated when learning information were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5774177/">better at recalling that information when drunk</a> than when sober, and there’s also evidence that our recall is better <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-32292-001">when our mood matches how we felt at learning</a>.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13444">new study published in <em>Child Development</em></a> has found that the same is true even of babies in their first year of life. The findings have implications for understanding infant memory — and could even help to explain why we can’t remember anything from our early years.</p>


<p><span id="more-40135"></span></p>


<p>To look at state-dependent memory in babies, Sabine Seehagen and colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany recruited 96 nine-month-old infants and their caregivers. In the learning phase of the experiment, the babies watched a researcher perform a series of actions with an animal puppet: removing the puppet’s mitten, shaking it three times, then replacing it. </p>



<p>After a short break, there was a test phase where the infant had the opportunity to play with the puppet themselves. They had 90 seconds to do any of the three actions — i.e. remove the mitten, shake it, and replace it — though they weren’t prompted to do so in any way.</p>



<p>Crucially, immediately before the learning and testing phases, the babies had a 5 minute play session designed to put them in a specific state of mind. Sometimes caregivers were instructed to play as calmly as possible with their infant and they were given quiet toys like a book and soft toy. Other times they were instructed to play as animatedly as possible, and given more active toys like a ball and swing.</p>



<p>For one group of infants, the play sessions were the same before both learning and testing phases (i.e. calm both times, or animated both times). In another group, the play sessions were different (i.e. calm at learning and animated at testing, or vice-versa). And a third group only did the testing phase, without the learning part (this allowed the researchers to look at how often the babies performed the actions just by chance).  </p>



<p>The team found that infants who had the same kind of play before both learning and testing made an average of 1.47 actions during testing. This was significantly more than those whose play sessions were different, who only made an average of 0.59 actions. In fact, the babies in the latter condition didn’t seem to remember the actions at all: they performed no better than the babies who hadn’t even done the learning part of the study.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that internal states do provide important cues for babies when they’re retrieving memories. And that seems to make sense: while older children and adults have a wealth of knowledge and experiences which allow them to use a variety of cues to trigger memories, young infants haven’t yet formed those connections. Relying on internal states to aid recall is therefore “highly adaptive”, the authors say.</p>



<p>This reliance on internal cues might also contribute to “infantile amnesia”, the fact that we’re unable to recall anything from our earliest years. As we grow our internal state changes considerably, and is never again going to match that of our first years of life — so, like the babies in the “different state” condition, we’re not able to access our memories.  </p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that the research didn’t directly measure babies’ internal states, as the team acknowledges. During the animated play sessions, the babies did show significantly more movement and active behaviour than during the calm sessions. But further work will be required to see whether memory recall is truly dependent on infants’ emotions — it could be that the matching types of activity were somehow providing cues to the babies even without influencing their mood.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/-NFg9bVWp4w/">Author Interview: Arunima Malik on Global Effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Arunima Malik and an international team of researchers recently assessed how the Coronavirus pandemic has caused worldwide consumption losses amounting to more than US$3.8 trillion while simultaneously spawning the largest recorded drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Their <em>PLOS ONE </em>paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235654"><em>Global socio-economic losses and environmental gains from the Coronavirus pandemic</em>,</a>” highlights the inherent dilemma of the global socio-economic system and the need for increased global cooperation and solidarity. Read on to see their thoughts on the need to move beyond discipline boundaries, the effects of their research on policy and more. </p>



<p><em><strong>The list of authors on this article spans the globe, with researchers affiliated with Australia, Japan, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, United States, and the United Kingdom. Can you speak on how this team was formed?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: The assessment presented in our published study was undertaken in the Global Industrial Ecological Virtual Laboratory — a cloud computing environment that brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and universities to foster new and innovative research.</p>



<p>We formed the multi-regional multi-disciplinary team to allow us to capture insights and data related to COVID-19 for not just English, but also for a range of languages. We followed a three-tier approach to enable us to best capture global events related to the pandemic. We note in the manuscript: “In addition to English, and in alphabetical order, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish were used in our search, thus covering languages spoken by over 5 billion people.”</p>



<p><em><strong>What drives you in your field of research, and why do you believe your research is important?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: I am passionate about understanding impacts embodied in complex supply chains. It’s important to be able to understand how systems are interconnected, and how effects in one system ripple through other systems. Sustainability applies to us all, and I enjoy being able to contribute to this evolving field of research. Regarding the current pandemic, these ripple effects have been further emphasized on a global scale. </p>



<p><em><strong>How crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of your research? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: My research is interdisciplinary as it brings together concepts and methodologies from a range of disciplines. It is therefore important to have structures that support interdisciplinary review and dissemination of results. There is a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research for understanding complex sustainability-related issues.</p>



<p><em><strong>What impact is your research having in your scientific community, in the media, and more widely? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: Research in supply chain analysis is definitely gaining relevance, and we are now starting to see the use of input-output tables by organisations for sustainability assessments. Input output analysis has been used in the reports published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Stockholm Environment Institute — such as the report on the <a href="https://www.sei.org/publications/spillovers-sdg-implementation-soy-argentina/">Argentina-EU soy supply chain</a> regarding impacts on Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr.</em> <em><a href="https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/people/bing-xue">Bing Xue</a>, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany, speaks on the importance of Arunima’s research and supply chain analyses. </em></p>



<p>BX: The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, triggering a great debate in the economic circles on the impact of the epidemic. As a result of the lockdown and other measures taken by various countries to deal with the pandemic, the supply chain at the enterprise level was disrupted, which led to the shutdown of global value chain trade, specifically in terms of consumption loss, income loss and employment loss. At the same time, due to the ripple effect of supply chain disruption, some polluting companies have reduced output, reducing GHG and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which has a positive impact on the environment. </p>



<p>Looking at the world as a cohesive whole, global MRIO-based supply-chain analyses helps to clearly understand the different impacts on countries in different positions of global value chain. The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on some important conditions for the rise and rapid progress of economic globalization, stimulating the restructuring of global value chains. </p>



<p>What is more important is the orderly development of economic globalization after the pandemic. Based on the perspective of the global industrial chain, how to cope with the impact of the outbreak and spread of the pandemic on the supply chain is an issue that should be concerned by the scientific community.</p>



<p><em>I would like to thank Arunima and Bing for their research and for taking the time to provide their thoughtful comments. </em></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We’ve all had the experience of losing our temper when being treated unfairly by someone else. And while anger isn’t the most pleasant emotion, it can be a useful social tool to signal to another person that we’re not happy with how they’re acting towards us.</p>



<p>But what about when we suffer because of bad luck, rather someone else’s actions? In that case it would seem to make little sense to get mad. And yet, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304967">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences </em>finds that a certain group of people are more likely to show anger in such situations: those who feel like they are particularly entitled in the first place.</p>


<p><span id="more-40124"></span></p>


<p>Psychological entitlement is essentially a belief that you deserve more than others. People who score highly in entitlement tend to think that others should be accommodating of their own needs and schedules, for instance, and are more likely to see themselves as being mistreated. When their high expectations aren’t met, they can experience reduced wellbeing and feelings of anger.</p>



<p>In a series of studies, Emily Zitek from Cornell University and Alexander Jordan from Harvard Medical School looked at whether these emotional effects of entitlement extend to situations solely involving bad luck. First, the pair asked 162 participants to fill in the Psychological Entitlement Scale, which asks respondents to rate their agreement with statements like “I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others”.  Participants were also asked how good they would expect their luck to normally be when rolling dice.</p>



<p>Participants were then told that they would be randomly allocated by dice roll to either a fun task (rating comic strips) or a boring task (counting the letters in a paragraph). In reality, all participants were told they had had “bad luck” and been assigned to the boring task. They then rated how unjust they felt this was, and indicated how angry they were.</p>



<p>The team found that those higher in entitlement had a stronger feeling of injustice and greater levels of anger. More entitled participants also generally expected to experience better luck when rolling dice, suggesting this is another instance where entitled people have (unrealistically) high expectations.</p>



<p>In a second study, participants were asked to recall either a time when something bad had happened to them solely because of bad luck, or when someone had treated them unfairly. They then indicated how fair and just they felt the event was, and rated their feelings of anger. </p>



<p>People high in entitlement again showed greater anger than those low in entitlement when recalling an instance of bad luck. But when remembering an instance of unfair treatment, those high and low in entitlement showed similar levels of anger. That is, entitlement again seemed to be an important factor in determining anger after bad luck, but not when there was a specific individual to blame.</p>



<p>Finally, the researchers looked at how entitlement related to feelings of anger and pity when <em>someone else</em> experiences bad luck. Participants read a scenario in which their flight had been cancelled and the airline was randomly selecting a customer to hop onto another plane with a spare seat. In one scenario they were told that they had been unlucky and someone else had been picked; in another they were the lucky one.</p>



<p>When the participants read that they had had bad luck, higher entitlement was once again related to greater feelings of anger. Unsurprisingly, participants didn’t feel much anger when they were assigned the seat and the other person was unlucky. But they did experience pity towards that person — and interestingly, those with a greater sense of entitlement reported <em>less</em> pity.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the studies suggest that entitled people expect to have good luck, and get angry after experiencing bad luck — even though by definition there is no-one to direct that anger towards. (The authors do acknowledge it’s possible that people implicitly blame God or some higher power for their bad luck).</p>



<p>So what are the consequences of experiencing anger in those situations? The researchers suggest that feelings of anger and injustice could reinforce people’s sense of entitlement, though they add that there could be benefits too — if anger motivates someone to try and improve their performance in the future, for instance (though that may be difficult in cases where a bad result is purely down to luck).</p>



<p>Similarly, it remains to be seen how the results translate to the real world. In most cases an instance of “bad luck” doesn’t occur in isolation, but often in a social setting — so it would seem prudent to examine whether this kind of anger is taken out on others.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></h4>

<p>In a previous <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">post</a> I described topics of conversations to have with a teenager leaving home for college. Equally, if not more important, is the process of communication.</p><p><strong>Understand the positive power of a strong family foundation</strong>. The power of a supportive family is almost unlimited.  Let me be clear that a family does not need to consist of a heterosexual mother and father, 2.5 children, and a golden retriever. A family is a group of people who are committed to one another for the long run, based on their love. If students understand that no matter what, they can depend on their family, any transition will be easier. Research supports this view: the same study of anxiety and depression during the pandemic revealed that family support was associated with fewer psychological disorders.</p><p><strong>Develop your family communication skills.</strong>  The first step in the communication process may sound simple at first: listen. Too many parents, especially when anxious, tend to lecture, perhaps the worst possible strategy for communicating with teens.  You can express your emotions first, not to meet your needs but to normalize a conversation about feelings.  A parent can open a conversation with a statement like,  “I know this is a hard time for most of us, and I know I’m a bit worried. How are you feeling?” In this way, you acknowledge that it is OK to be frightened or anxious. Listening takes time, accepting some silence, and it isn’t always easy. Your teen may brush you off at first—that’s okay, there will be other opportunities. Keep the lines of communication.</p><p><strong>Accept that communication may change</strong>. Flexibility will be key for a positive transition to college.  You may hear from your child less often: embrace that as growth. He is learning to depend on other people for support, expanding his social world.  He may primarily use texting or short phone calls when he’s walking.  You also have the right to let your child know that you need to hear from them now and then.  But don’t invade their space by reading their Instagram or Twitter. You can respect their privacy and if you want to learn more about campus life, subscribe to the student newspaper or check the college website. Other students, especially during these uncertain times, may want to stay connected and text or call often. If you already text or talk on the phone with your teen frequently, the contact may stay the same or increase. They are letting you know what they need. There is no absolute right or wrong rate of communication, especially during the first few months of the college transition.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. It is axiomatic in mental health that if a parent feels psychologically healthy, so will a child.  To support your student, they need to feel that you are OK, that they can leave knowing that the situation at home is solid. This doesn’t mean that your family will be free of stress, but that you will be able to cope or find solutions to problems that arise. This is called “self-efficacy.” You may have lost your job or suffered financial setbacks during this time, or worse, lost a loved one to COVID-19. And you are probably going to miss your child. You may be under additional pressure if you are a single parent, a member of a minority group, or if you work on the front lines of healthcare or a service industry. It also appears that mothers who work outside the home may also be doing the lion’s share of the housework and educational needs of their children. Try to take time for yourself by establishing <strong>daily</strong> relaxing rituals, like short meditations or breathing exercises or listening to music. Reach out to your partner, a close friend or relative for support. Just as your child needs care, so do you.</p><p>This is a time for all of us to focus on values, on what matters most. For most of us, family and education are fundamental. Parents can help their college-age children move through this unexpectedly difficult transition, and we all need to take care of one another.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit:<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/lovely-teenage-with-grandmother-home_5432734.htm"> Image</a> by jcomp via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/634481516/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><em>You were hoping to go out with friends on Saturday night, but your partner really wants to have a quiet night at home instead…</em></p>



<p><em>Your life’s going great, but then your partner is offered their dream job in a town you’d happily never visit, let alone live in…</em></p>



<p>So what do you do? Do you stand your ground? Or you do you sacrifice your own goals for the sake of your partner’s?</p>



<p>It’s a dilemma familiar to anyone who’s ever been in a relationship. It would seem reasonable, then, to assume that research could tell us what the likely impacts would be on individual wellbeing, and on the health of the relationship itself. However, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-51177-001">new paper</a> published in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> point out, there are two conflicting hypotheses for how sacrifices should pan out.</p>


<p><span id="more-40117"></span></p>


<p>The “benefit hypothesis” holds that making sacrifices can relieve tension in a relationship and help to build a climate of trust and cooperation. According to the “burden hypothesis”, however, when one partner sacrifices a personal goal, and compromises on their autonomy, their own wellbeing takes a hit.</p>



<p>Francesca Righetti at the Free University of Amsterdam led work that set out to look at what actually happens. And the results are fascinating: if you feel that you would <em>in theory</em> be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just <em>says</em> that they would), it’s a different story.</p>



<p>Righetti and her colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 82 sets of data on sacrifice and wellbeing in relationships, comprising more than 32,000 people. Only some of the data, collected in nine different countries, had previously been published, and just over half of the data sets came from studies that included same-sex couples, with the rest exclusively focused on mixed-sex couples. The team looked at four different facets of sacrifice: willingness to sacrifice (saying that in theory, you would), behavioural sacrifice (actually sacrificing), satisfaction with a sacrifice and costs of a sacrifice.</p>



<p>They found that when someone reported being willing to make a particular hypothetical sacrifice for their romantic partner, this was linked not only to higher personal wellbeing (more positive emotional states and greater life satisfaction) but also higher “relationship wellbeing” scores both from that individual and also their partner.</p>



<p>The results in relation to actual sacrifices were striking, though. Though the relationship wellbeing scores weren’t affected, the individual’s personal wellbeing ratings were lower when they made more frequent sacrifices.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that reporting a general willingness to sacrifice and actually regularly making sacrifices for your partner are two very different things — a reported willingness “may only weakly correspond to actually performing these sacrifices in everyday life,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>The data did also reveal, however, that when people said they gained  satisfaction from giving up their own goals and preferences in favour of their partner’s, they tended (unsurprisingly) to report more positive personal and also relationship wellbeing than if they had not felt satisfied with their sacrifice. Similarly, when the personal costs of a sacrifice were reported to be higher, the individual’s personal and relationship wellbeing scores also tended to be lower. (This difference may relate simply to the size of the sacrifice — going with your partner’s plans for Saturday night vs agreeing to move to another town or country, for example.)</p>



<p>“Thus,” the team writes, “although results aligned with the benefit hypothesis when considering willingness to sacrifice and satisfaction with sacrifice, data were consistent with the burden hypothesis when considering behavioural sacrifices and costs of sacrifice.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found some gender-related effects. The associations between all four facets of sacrifice and personal and relationship wellbeing were more negative for women than for men. Why? The team suggests that women typically make more sacrifices than men do and so, when they do sacrifice, they may receive less appreciation and gratitude from their partner, and also society in general, than men. Consequently, women may have less positive attitudes towards sacrifice than men, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Why, though, should a reported <em>willingness</em> to sacrifice be linked to various benefits, when actual sacrifices were not?</p>



<p>Feeling willing, in theory, to sacrifice may of course be linked to having a stronger relationship in the first place. Also, people who feel like this may be generally more prosocial in other ways, which could enhance their partner’s own wellbeing and perceptions of the relationship itself. </p>



<p>So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”</p>

<p><strong>PhD in Computational &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience</strong></p>
<p>An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force.</p>
<p>The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.</p>
<p>We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.</p>
<p>The 3-year full-time PhD studentship includes a stipend of £15,285 per annum in addition to covering tuition fees. Only EU and UK citizens are eligible to apply.
The start date of the PhD will be January 2021.</p>
<p>The PhD will be supervised by Dr Shabnam Kadir (University of Hertfordshire), Dr Elena Antonova (Brunel University London), Prof Robert Leech (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London), and Prof Chrystopher Nehaniv (University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).</p>
<p>Interested candidates are encouraged to make informal inquiries with Dr Shabnam Kadir (<code>s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk</code>) before making a formal application.</p>
<p>To apply, submit <a class="reference external" href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf">an application form</a> (downloadable from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf">https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf</a>) together with a cover letter, CV, and scanned copies of  university transcripts and degree certificates (BSc, and if relevant MSc) via email to <code>doctoralcollegeadmissions AT herts.ac.uk</code>, cc-ing Dr Kadir on <code>s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk</code> and Dr Antonova on <code>elena.antonova AT brunel.ac.uk</code></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s a commonly held notion that young people are more hopeful about the future than any other group — you might have heard this referred to, either positively or negatively, as “youthful optimism”. Even Jane Austen picked up on it: “There is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions”, she wrote in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</p>



<p>But is this actually the case? According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300738">new study</a> from William J. Chopik and colleagues published in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, optimism actually continues growing well past youth — and it’s only later in life that it begins to decline.</p>


<p><span id="more-40105"></span></p>


<p>The team was interested in how optimism changes with age — and how life events might affect that trajectory. They gathered data from three longitudinal studies of people aged between 16 and 101: one from the Netherlands (10,045 participants), one from Germany (42,691 participants) and one from the United States (22,150 participants).</p>



<p>In the Dutch and American studies optimism was tracked using a six-item measure, with participants rating how much they agreed with statements including “I expect more good things to happen” or “I rarely count on good things”. In Germany, participants rated how optimistic or pessimistic they were about the future on a scale from 1 to 4.</p>



<p>The team also looked at sixteen life events concerning children (e.g. childbirth, or a child leaving home), relationships (e.g. getting married or divorcing,), parents (loss of a parent), moving house, health, and employment (e.g. getting a job for the first time or retiring). The team then measured variance in the optimism measure from 2006 to 2016, mapping it against these life events.</p>



<p>Results suggested that “youthful optimism” isn’t quite as accurate a concept as we might assume: in fact, younger adults were <em>lower</em> in optimism than middle aged people. This hopefulness then plateaued until later life, when optimism started to decline again. This also held for pessimism, which was highest among older adults and sharply decreased as young adults reached middle age.</p>



<p>It might not fit our assumptions about optimism, but it does make sense that optimism increases into middle age. As we get older we have more and more experience of success, whether that’s in our careers or our personal lives. We’re more likely to know what we want out of life and may also feel in control of the future – hence feeling more optimistic.</p>



<p>This pattern was different in the German sample, however, where younger adults were <em>more</em> optimistic than their middle aged counterparts: the team suggests this may be down to social and cultural changes between generations specific to Germany.     </p>



<p>Predictably, optimism was sometimes related to positive events and pessimism to negative events — if you’ve experienced chronic illness, unemployment or bereavement it makes sense you’d have less hope for the future. However, results weren’t consistent between samples and were not all so straightforward: for instance, negative changes in health were associated with <em>higher</em> levels of optimism in some cases.</p>



<p>These inconsistent results could be because life events were simply categorised as either “occurred” or “did not occur”, which may not pick up on the nuances of how people actually experience things. A break-up, for example, might be a <em>positive</em> life event for somebody in a miserable relationship; similarly, leaving the parental home may be more or less emotionally significant depending on person and context. Future research could look at categorising life events more thoroughly.</p>



<p>Limitations aside, the results do suggest that human beings tend to be fairly optimistic for most of their lives. As Chopik <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/study-shows-humans-are-optimists-for-most-of-life/">says</a>, this resilience is a cheering thought. “We often think that the really sad or tragic things that happen in life completely alter us as people,” he said. “But people diagnosed with an illness or who go through another crisis still felt positive about the future and what life had ahead for them on the other side.”</p>

<p>In their study, Prof. Holger Volk and colleagues at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover presented dogs with samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive or –negative nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.</p>
<p>This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.</p>

<p>With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer. In their recently published study in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, Mensah and Adjei look at how gender and the level of welfare provision by the state impact the association between work-life balance and self-reported health. The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

<p>Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, Clayton <em>et al. </em>systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.</p>

<p>High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a>, Li <em>et al.</em> use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.</p>
<p>Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.</p>
<p>Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms. An understanding of these mechanisms may prove useful in future efforts to promote stress tolerance in commercially important crops like sugar beet.</p>

<p>Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a>, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.</p>

<p>The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Of all “cross-modal” findings, the most famous is surely the bouba-kiki effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the sound <em>bouba</em> and spiky shapes with <em>kiki</em>. However, research has not yet revealed why this effect is common among adults who speak very different languages — and even in infants as young as four.</p>



<p>Various theories have been put forward. One holds that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/">levels of emotional arousal may be key</a> — that both <em>kiki </em>and a spiky shape trigger relatively high levels of arousal, compared with <em>bouba</em> and a blob. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967">new study</a>, reported in <em>Psychological Science</em>, provides compelling evidence for this idea. The researchers also take their findings further, arguing that they could have important implications for understanding the early evolution of languages.</p>


<p><span id="more-40093"></span></p>


<p>For an initial study, Arash Aryani at Freie Universität Berlin and colleagues presented English-speaking students (at Cornell University, US) with shapes and words taken from previous studies that have investigated the bouba-kiki effect. (For example, <em>maluma</em> vs <em>takete</em>, from <a href="https://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=870792">the original 1929 report </a>of this word/shape effect). In each case, the participants had to use a five-point scale to rate how calming or exciting they considered these words or shapes to be. The results revealed significantly higher arousal ratings for kiki-type than bouba-type words and shapes.</p>



<p>Next, the team asked a fresh group of participants to use the same scale to rate 940 computer-generated pseudo-words (which were all spoken in a neutral tone by an actor) for how arousing they sounded. These pseudo-words all sounded like they could be English words, but they had no meaning (think <em>tylo</em> or <em>sooking</em>, for example). Separately, the team analysed them, looking for particular acoustic features that earlier work has suggested we use to infer different emotional states. (For example, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0990">variations in the fundamental frequency of even animal sounds lead us to infer different emotions</a>, and quickly-pulsating sounds are associated with high arousal.)</p>



<p>The results showed a clear relationship — those pseudo-words that the researchers expected, based on their acoustic analysis, to trigger more arousal received higher arousal ratings from the participants. The same was true for low arousal.</p>



<p>The team then applied the acoustic model to the specific bouba-like and kiki-like words that they’d used in the first experiment. They found that the model predicted significantly higher arousal values for the kiki-like words than for the bouba-like words. This suggested, then, that the acoustic features of <em>bouba</em> and <em>kiki</em> (and similar pairs) explain the low vs high arousal ratings given by the participants in the first study.</p>



<p>Together, the results suggest that, no matter what the word (or pseudo-word), depending on its acoustic features, it will trigger different perceptions of arousal. “Any wordlike stimulus can potentially convey emotional information solely on the basis of its perceptual acoustic characteristics, making it possible to match it with emotionally similar concepts, eg. shapes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Based on the results of the second experiment, the researchers then identified groups of “high-arousal”, “medium-arousal”, and “low-arousal” pseudo-words. They asked a fresh batch of participants to match these to a range of spiky and rounded shapes (again taken from previous studies). As the team predicted, spiky shapes were most likely to be matched to high-arousal pseudo-words (followed by medium-arousal and then finally low-arousal examples), while rounded shapes were most likely to be matched to the low arousal group. “These results suggest that the extent to which a word in a bouba-kiki experiment is matched with a rounded shape or spiky shape depends on the level of arousal elicited by its sound,” the team writes. </p>



<p>The findings not only support the emotional arousal theory to explain the bouba-kiki effect but may also shed light on the early stages of language evolution, they add.</p>



<p>The finding that humans can reliably identify levels of arousal in the vocal sounds of a range of animals is telling, they think. “An initial form of vocalisation might have been a motor reflection of arousal in the vocal tract. Such vocalisations might gradually have been used to refer to external objects that were associated with similar affective experience.” So a sharp rock could become associated with high-arousal sounds (and note the “sharp” sound of <em>rock</em> vs <em>bubble</em>, say.)</p>



<p>If our early speech sounds and words were grounded in our emotional, arousal system, this could have made them easier to learn, and so more likely to be retained, the team thinks. And though most words are often held up to be arbitrary, there’s increasing evidence that this is often not the case — our word sound/meaning links go deeper than the onomatopoeia of <em>crack</em> for instance, or the ideogram of <em>zigzag</em>, and can, it seems, be grounded in our emotional responses.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/alignment-tools/">Alignment tools</a></h4>

<p>This blog posts covers some tools and techniques that I’m typically using to align two-photon microscopes. If you’re an expert, you will probably find nothing new, but if you haven’t been doing this for years, this might offer you some pieces of inspiration.</p>



<p>Aligning a microscope is the process of optimizing the parts to produce better images than before. A useful overview of basic alignment procedures for two-photon microscopes has been put together in this <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/neurowire/labhacks-how-to-align-your-laser-for-two-photon-imaging">#LabHacks blog post</a> by Scientifica. It also includes safety advice (which I will not repeat here; keep in mind that lasers, especially pulsed IR-laser, are really dangerous, and all safety instructions of your institute and lab must always be obeyed!)</p>



<p>Microscope alignment still seems to be a secret art that most microscope users are afraid of. It is not by principle difficult to learn, but it is a practical skill and requires both patience and a mentor who shows where to buy stuff and how to touch the mechanical and optical elements. Most people working with microscopes are prevented from learning because they are afraid to touch anything. This blog post is intended to help lower the fear of optical alignment – by showing that the tools used for alignment can be very simple.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1. Adjust the beam to a given height above the optical breadboard</strong></p>



<p>After the beam comes out of the laser, you often want to keep the beam in one single plane parallel to the table, in order to keep things simple. In other words, the distance of the beam from the optical table should be the same everywhere. One way to achieve this is to use mounted pinholes (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=206">these ones from Thorlabs</a>). However, it is sometimes difficult to properly see where the beams hits the pinhole, which results in imprecise alignment and unnecessary uncertainty. When I worked with <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/prevedel/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60022898">Robert Prevedel </a>in 2013/2014, he showed me a simple trick which makes it very easy to adjust all beam positions to the same height. He used a small hex key and two washers to clamp it horizontally onto an inverted post with a screw, as shown below. The surfaces of the hex key lead to a very nice horizontal alignment, and the precise height indicated by the hex key can be used to (1) adjust the beam itself or (2) to consistently adjust the height of a set of pin holes. It is useful to have and very simple to make.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Printed-out resolution targets</strong></p>



<p>Is the beam centered in a given aperture, for example the cage system of the microscope’s tube lens? Normally, I would use a threaded or cage-mounted iris (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">this one</a>), but in other cases spatial constraints do not allow this, or the beam can only be viewed from an angle, and it can be difficult to judge whether the beam scattering from the iris is centered or not. </p>



<p>However, if the laser power is low enough not to burn paper, I simply paint resolution targets with Powerpoint or Inkscape and print them out on a sheet of paper resolution targets. When I’m in a hurry, I simply draw it with a pen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6490" data-attachment-id="6490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="target" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg" data-orig-size="1300,975" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/target/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>For example, if I want to check whether a beam is collimated (that means, the beam does not change its diameter a lot over the distance), I use these alignment targets as a reference and as a guide for the eye.</p>



<p>Or I use some scotch to fix it into a given aperture, allowing me to check whether the beam is centered or not. Here illustrated for the aperture which is approximately located at the back focal plane of the objective. Does not require much work but is quite helpful.</p>

<p><strong>3. Using mirrors to look around corners</strong></p>



<p>One more practical problem in the above case is the viewing angle. Ideally, I would like to look at the alignment target from the top, but this would at the same time block the beam. To solve this (and many very similar problems), you can simply use a mirror shard. The photo below (left) shows a hand-held piece of <strong>mirror</strong> which allows to look at the alignment target in a relaxed way. It is difficult to see this from a single picture, but mirrors like this one (either hand-held or fixed in the setup) often make life much easier.</p>



<p>For more convenience, <strong>dental mirrors</strong> like <a href="https://www.the-lash-shop.com/products/milimeter-metal-dental-mirror-handheld-black-and-gold-plasma">this mirror</a> (photo below, right) are designed to conveniently look around corners and are of great use to look at pinholes from angles that are difficult to get at without mirrors.</p>



<p>However, be very careful with hand-held and any other moving mirrors! By chance, you might reflect the laser beam into your own eyes! Always be careful and think three times whether there is any chance that any reflection might hit your eyes.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>4. Retro-reflecting mirrors and lenses</strong></p>



<p>Usually, the laser beam should hit a lens at its center and at a 90° angle. To ensure that the beam is centered, one can use a) a cage system with a pinhole, or b) a <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">threaded pinhole</a> that can be screwed onto the lens directly, or c) a printed-out removable resolution target (see above). To make sure that, in addition, the laser beam hits the lens with a 90° angle, it is helpful to use back-reflections of the beam. Since a small fraction of the beam is back-reflected by the lens surface, it should ideally coincide with the incoming beam. This can be checked with an IR detection card or, for a visible beam, a piece of paper held close to (but not hiding the) incoming beam path.</p>



<p>Sometimes it is necessary to align a caged element or something similar without lenses that provide back-reflecting surfaces. In this case, you can simply use a mirror that reflects the entire beam back. This mirror can be screwed into a thread of a cage system. More often, it suffices to put a small and flat mirror shard at the flat back of the caged system. This does not provide the highest precision alignment, but is usually good enough for most purposes.</p>



<p>Be aware that back-reflections that go directly back into the laser can make the laser unstable. If a pulsed laser stops pulsing, first check whether any back-reflections could be the reason for it. </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>5. Retro-reflecting gratings</strong></p>



<p>The main problem with back-reflections from lenses and mirrors is that the beam is often small and coincides with the incoming beam, making it difficult to properly identify.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a>, I inherited a really cool tool that was used for alignment of a Sutter MOM scope and which I was, unfortunately, unable to find afterwards on the internet. It is basically a mirror, but with a sort of grating scratched into the mirror surface. Due to interference, the back-reflections were not simply a single beam, but a symmetric diffraction pattern that extended over several centimeters and could be conveniently used for alignment – much more useful and easier to use than the back-reflections of a lens or mirror. I guess that any flat reflective gratings (maybe even compact discs? I have to tried that) could be used for this same purpose.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>6. Wedge plates</strong></p>



<p>At several points of the beam path (before entering the back of the objective; after exiting a beam expander) the laser beam should ideally be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_beam">collimated</a>. The standard method that I used for years was to print out a resolution target made of paper (described above). I used it to check whether the beam changes its diameter when propagating freely over several meters. To this end, it is often necessary to deflect the beam with a mirror that must be temporarily inserted into the beam path.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mesospim">Fabian Voigt</a> from my <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">current lab in Zürich</a> also showed me the more professional way to check for collimation, using a wedge plate. Wedge plates can be used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_interferometer">shearing interferometers</a> (<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2970">Thorlabs product</a>, <a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/paralinetrade-collimation-tester/11575/">EO product</a>). They generate an interference pattern which can be used to very precisely check the collimation of the beam.</p>

<p>Fabian also kindly pointed me to a paper (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-11-13833">Tsai et al., 2015</a>) which mentions that the pattern seen from a shearing interferometer can also be used to analyze less obvious properties of the beam, like coma and astigmatism aberrations (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-39-28-5179">Okuda et al., 2000</a>). It would be cool to have a look-up table of typical interferograms and the corresponding wavefront shapes and aberrations!</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>7. Alignment lasers</strong></p>



<p>Another tool that Fabian showed to me was an alignment laser.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6503" data-attachment-id="6503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1571242397&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.12&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="img_3787" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/img_3787/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>This alignment laser is basically a continuous wave-visible light laser that goes through a optical fiber and afterwards enters a beam coupler. I used a shearing interferometer (described above) to make sure that the outgoing beam was collimated, and then used the collimated beam for backward alignment.</p>



<p>Backward alignment means to insert the collimated beam of the alignment laser at the location of the microscope’s back focal plane and then aligning the microscope’s components in a backward manner (tube lens -&gt; scan lens -&gt; scanners -&gt; etc.; instead of forward alignment, which starts at the pulsed laser and goes forward until it ends up at the objective). This is helpful for example when two or more separate incoming beams are combined. A second advantage of the alignment laser is that the laser beam is, unlike the near-IR pulsed laser, visible to the human eye.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>8. Continuous wave (cw) mode for a pulsed Ti:Sa laser</strong></p>



<p>Standard two-photon microscopes are based on pulsed lasers that have a center wavelength adjusted between 800 and 1000 nm. The light is therefore invisible to the human eye (except for some faint spectral components when the center wavelength is adjusted to 800 nm) and comes with high average power (&gt;1 W, or often much more) and in ultra-short high-energy pulses, making it a very dangerous thing to deal with. IR viewer cards and IR viewers, or less expensive solutions based on <a href="https://labrigger.com/blog/2015/04/20/inexpensive-ir-viewer-options/">simple cameras/webcams</a>, can make the beam visible to our human eye, but I always found this very exhausting to work with. And being exhausted is not a good pre-condition for optical alignment, which requires the ability to stay focused and a sharp mind. Therefore, it would be great if it was possible to make the laser less dangerous: by preventing it from pulsing, by lowering the overall power, and by making it visible…</p>



<p>Fortunately, all of this is possible for the tunable wavelength Ti:Sa lasers (although not for the fixed 1040 nm lasers). For the Spectra Physics MaiTai lasers, the slightly old-fashioned user-interface (screenshot below) allows to manually lower the pump power (also called the “green power”). Change the wavelength to something visible (something between 700 and 750 nm), lower the green power until the pulsing (indicated by the green light in the main control window) stops and continue lowering the green power until the output IR power reaches something like 30-40 mW. This is still much more than the average laser pointer and still dangerous, but less so than a pulsed invisible beam.</p>



<p>It is however important to keep in mind that the control panel is not always 100% reliable. It switches between pulsing and non-pulsing as if these were binary states. But there is a sometimes continuous transition between the two, and sometimes the laser also becomes a bit unstable and oscillates between states – so, better watch the laser for a while before you start working with the beam.</p>

<p>I once talked to a laser engineer from Spectra Physics who told me that it would not be ideal to leave the laser in this non-pulsing state for too long (&gt;&gt; 1 hours). Probably this has something to do with inefficient energy conversion and the heat generated in this process. But I have to admit that I follow this recommendation simply because I don’t know it better. Lasers are complex things, and I mostly treat them in a pragmatic way, like a black box.</p>

<p><strong>9. Improvised test samples</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common mistakes that I keep seeing is to set up a microscope and then try to test it with a real sample, like a living brain of a transgenic mouse. That’s really not the best way to proceed. Instead, always test your microscope with a simple, bright and dead sample. (And, ideally in addtion also with sub-diffraction beads.)</p>



<p>For example, you can use colored plastic items (for example <a href="https://www.chroma.com/products/accessories/92001-autofluorescent-plastic-slides">plastic slides</a>), perfect to test how homogeneous the FOV is. Or <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/springtime-for-two-photon-microscopy/">pollen grains</a> from any flowers outdoors during the pollen season. Or dead, small insects that you caught from your desk. Their surface will often be super bright under a two-photon microscope, especially if you remove the emission filters. Or simply a single strand of your hair (especially if you have still some pigments in them).</p>



<p>In general, most solid things are somehow autofluorescent, and it can be really fun to look at random things below the two-photon microscope. Pay attention not to kill the PMT detector (lower the initial PMT gain), since autofluorescence of natural things can be very bright.</p>

<p><em> By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p><em>“…Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you.”</em></p>



<p>This passage, pulled from Isaiah 41.10, is just one example of the Bible’s many references to God’s power to protect. And this protective persona might affect you much more than you think. At least that’s what emerged in 2015, when researchers from Stanford University published a string of studies finding that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614563108?casa_token=kI9UANJRFMQAAAAA%3AE1UVVQWf5QHj2jSgvhawv2kDn6w8rhexo14CmTI74rZziCnSeA-CSasanAo4lYHhFm6GvR1MF3Xe">people prompted to think of God made significantly riskier decisions</a> — whether or not they were religious.</p>


<p>The scientists’ explanation, promptly picked up by the media, was that thinking of God makes risk-taking less intimidating because it primes us to expect divine protection. As of recently, however, this narrative has not stood up to scrutiny. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477">first pre-registered replication of this study</a>, published in the journal <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests that the effect was probably no more than an exciting false positive.</p>
<p><span id="more-40080"></span></p>


<p>The failure to replicate such a high-profile experiment will probably come as a disappointment. The original publication had certainly generated a global splash, giving rise to headlines like <em>“</em><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/religion-makes-people-take-or-avoid-risks-skydiving-versus-drinking-gambling-sex.html"><em>God is my co-pilot</em></a><em>” </em>and <em>“</em><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/thank-god-for-risky-behavior"><em>Thank God for risky behaviour</em></a><em>”. </em>In many ways, the study stated a convincing case. It featured nine experiments, all of which concurred that being reminded of God triggered a significant increase in people’s tendency to take on risk. In these experiments, a mix of religious and non-religious participants from across the US were prompted to think either of God or an unrelated topic, such as astronomy. In most cases, this was achieved by having participants solve scrambled sentences, which either contained religions words (e.g. “spirit” or “divine”) or non-religious words.</p>



<p>Participants then indicated how likely they were to engage in a range of risky behaviours related to ethical dilemmas (like taking credit for someone else’s work), safety concerns (driving a car without a seatbelt) or social risk (starting a whole new career in one’s mid-thirties). The effects seemed clear. Those who had been primed to think of God were significantly more likely to consider engaging in risky behaviours, as long as these did not involve an ethical transgression. Moreover, participants in the “God-prime” condition perceived significantly less risk in all of these behaviours, as if thinking of God really had reduced the sense of threat.</p>



<p>But some researchers were concerned. Looking at the string of statistical results, many of which had just made it over the threshold of significance, one couldn’t help but wonder — what if this divine protection effect was just a statistical blip? The answer arrived a few weeks ago, when Will Gervais from the University of Kentucky and colleagues repeated two of the original 2015 experiments in exact detail, but with one crucial difference. They recruited a substantially larger sample of over a thousand participants, which was designed to give the researchers a very strong probability of detecting the “God-prime” effect, if it did really exist. Their study revealed no evidence that being primed to think of God had the power to make people choose riskier behaviours. There was no effect even when the authors ran a mini meta-analysis combining their own findings with those of the original publication.</p>



<p>So far, this failed replication has not been met with the media attention that surrounded the original paper. Perhaps that study struck a chord because it resonated with our long-held ideas about the function of religion. Many sociologists and psychologists believe that religion helps individuals deal with stress by offering a padding of divine protection, which makes the chaos and volatility of daily life less frightening. Indeed, the “God comfort hypothesis” has received considerable support from international surveys, which find that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx,%20https:/doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0021140">national levels of religion tend to go hand-in-hand with governmental instability and poor material security</a>. Strife might directly throw previously unbelieving people into the arms of God. This was observed in Christchurch, New Zealand, where researchers spotted a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049648">sudden spike in religiosity</a> in the aftermath of its devastating 2011 earthquake. Thus, when researchers discovered that the sense of security associated with God not only gives us perceived shelter from risk, but actually emboldens us to seek it out, their findings might have enjoyed some degree of automatic credibility.</p>



<p>But experience should have taught us that caution is the better policy. Researchers have failed to replicate a host of high-profile discoveries,  <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">from the controversial effects of “power posing”</a> on our confidence and stress hormones, to the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/16/another-social-psychology-classic-bites-the-dust-meta-analysis-finds-little-evidence-for-the-macbeth-effect">Macbeth Effect</a>, which claims that having our moral purity threatened makes us literally want to clean ourselves. As psychological science works to recover from its replication crisis, and scientific editors increasingly realise the importance of publishing negative results, communicators of popular science may need to be careful about overstating the certainty of new and exciting findings. As with the God-priming effect, some discoveries might not be scientific scripture after all.</p>

<p class="">The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. It is located in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>. </p><h2>What is the fusiform face area and what does it do?</h2><p class="">By the late 1990s, researchers had built up a fair amount of evidence that suggested there are parts of our brain that are especially active when we look at faces. This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. </p><p class="">In 1997, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/" target="_blank">researchers published a groundbreaking study</a> that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri" target="_blank">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a> to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.</p><p class="">The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the <em>fusiform face area</em>, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as <em>prosopagnosia</em>, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.</p><p class="">Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/" target="_blank">found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery</a>, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/" target="_blank">caused disruptions in the perception of faces</a>. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term <em>fusiform face area</em>—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.</p><p class="">Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/">some argue</a> that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/">a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well</a>. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. </p><p class="">But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the <em>expertise hypothesis</em>, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/" target="_blank">one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased</a> in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/" target="_blank">Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts</a> viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/" target="_blank">another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA</a> when viewing x-rays than med students did. </p><p class="">The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/" target="_blank">a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies</a> found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. </p><p class=""><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></p><p class="">Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Music and humans go back a very long way. The earliest accepted instruments, made from bones, appear on the European scene about 40,000 years ago. But for perhaps at least a million years before that, our ancestors had the throat architecture that in theory would have allowed them to sing.</p>
<p>All kinds of ideas have been put forward for why and how music came to matter so much to us. But what’s abundantly clear is that it <em>does</em> matter; there isn’t a society out there that doesn’t make and listen to music. And new research is now revealing all manner of psychological and neurological effects…<span id="more-40074"></span></p>
<h3>But what about people who don’t like music?</h3>
<p>Music is a human universal, but it’s true — not everyone enjoys music. In fact, as a 2014 paper published in <em>Current Biology</em> revealed, some perfectly healthy people can perceive music just like anybody else, but <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00133-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096098221400133X?showall=true">their reward-related neural circuits don’t respond to it</a>. (These circuits do still respond to food or money, for example, so it’s not that they’re generally defective).</p>
<p>In fact, an <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/31/2/118/62587/Individual-Differences-in-Music-Reward-Experiences">estimated 3-5% of people</a> experience “musical anhedonia”, and get no pleasure from music. (To find out where you sit on the music reward spectrum, you could fill in the team’s questionnaire, available <a href="http://brainvitge.org/z_oldsite/bmrq.php">here</a>.) Last year, a team that included some of the same researchers published a follow-up study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>. They <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/25/5018">found a neurobiological basis for their earlier observations</a>: differences in the white matter “wiring” that connects the auditory cortex and the ventral striatum, a key part of the reward system. What causes these differences is not yet clear.</p>
<h3>For the rest of us, what is it about a piece of music that gives us pleasure?</h3>
<p>Last year, a team led by Vincent Cheung at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany published an <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31258-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982219312588?showall=true">analysis of responses to 745 US Billboard pop songs</a>. They found that expectancy is key. When listeners were pretty certain about which chord to expect next (based on what had come before), they found it pleasurable to be surprised. When they weren’t sure what to expect, though, more predictable subsequent chords were pleasing.</p>
<p>Popular songs strike a good balance between both subverting expectation and reassuring listeners, the team concluded. “It is fascinating that humans can derive pleasure from a piece of music just by how sounds are ordered over time,” Cheung commented. It is also important for understanding how music influences our emotional state…</p>
<h3>Why do we like listening to sad music?</h3>
<p>The first point to stress is that we don’t all necessarily like it. In 2016, a team led by Tuomas Eerola at the University of Durham <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157444">reported on the emotional experiences connected with sad music</a> of 2,436 people in the UK and Finland. The majority said they enjoyed sad music, and that this pleasure boosted their mood. “However, there are people who absolutely hate sad-sounding music and avoid listening to it,” notes Eerola. The study revealed that for these people, sad music was associated with painful personal experiences, such as loss.</p>
<p>Still, the reports of mood-<em>boosting</em> effects from the majority is important. In 2015, a paper titled “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295">Sad as a Matter of Choice?</a>” reported that people with depression were more likely to listen to sad songs — which the team controversially took to imply that they were maintaining or even worsening their own low mood. Last year, however, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001">a study published in <em>Emotion</em></a> found that depressed people prefer sad music because it is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/">calming and even uplifting</a>. As some participants in another recent study commented, when you’re feeling low, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/">sad music can seem like a supportive friend</a>.</p>
<h3>Extreme emotions</h3>
<p>Some pieces of music have dramatic effects on us. “Peak emotional states” involve powerful physical responses, such as tears, or feeling “the chills”, and often extreme sadness or joy. They can be triggered by something inherently deeply meaningful — such as childbirth — but also by a beautiful view, or piece of music. A 2017 study published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/02/psychologists-have-studied-whats-happening-when-music-gives-us-chills-or-makes-us-cry/">explored these reactions</a>, and found that song-induced tears were associated with subsequent calming — they seem, then, to have a cathartic, relieving function.</p>
<p>Some people, though, are more prone than others to feeling goosebumps or a shiver down the spine in response to a piece of music. And as a paper recently published in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em> has revealed, such people have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/884/2223400">stronger connectivity between auditory processing and social and emotional processing areas</a> of the brain. These same connectivity differences have also been linked to greater empathy. As the researchers write in their paper: “Perhaps one of the reasons why music is a cross-culturally indispensable artifact is that it appeals directly through an auditory channel to emotional and social processing centers of the human brain.” Only, it does this more for some of us than others.</p>
<h3>Connecting brains</h3>
<p>One proposed adaptive function for music is that it unites individuals. With music, we can march together, dance together, and express emotions as one. And there’s now growing evidence that this unity can occur right down at the neural level.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, Ulman Lindenberger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and colleagues reported that when two guitarists play the same piece of music together, their brainwaves synchronise. Big deal, you might think: they’re processing and playing identical notes, so why shouldn’t there be similarities in their brain activity? However, in 2012, the team <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00312/full">reported a follow-up</a> involving duets with <em>different </em>guitar parts. When these pairs had to actively coordinate their playing, there was a synchronisation in activity in some regions <em>between</em> the two. This, the team concluded, was evidence of “inter-brain networks”. “When people coordinate actions with one another, small networks within the brain and, remarkably, between the brains are formed,” noted Johanna Sänger, lead author of this study.</p>
<p>Since then, more evidence of inter-brain synchronisation during musical experiences has emerged. It’s known that when audience members are enjoying a piece of live music, their brainwaves tend to synchronise. And, earlier this year, a team led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University revealed that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/">when a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, a synchronisation in brain activity develops.</a> The team were even able to use the strength of this “inter-brain coherence” to predict how much the audience reported enjoying a piece.</p>
<h3>Use the beat</h3>
<p>Humans are unique as a species in being able to perceive beat. And there’s all kinds of evidence that the tempo of a piece of music affects our behaviour. A classic study, published back in 1986, found that diners in a Dallas restaurant <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489234?seq=1">ate significantly faster</a> when faster tempo (more beats per minute) music was played, compared with slow tempo music. These findings went on to influence the choice of soundtracks in restaurants the world over. But there’s also recent <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00074/full">evidence that listening to high-tempo music while exercising can increase heart rate</a> more than slow-tempo music and also make the exercise feel less difficult. “This means that the exercise seemed like less effort but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,” commented researcher Luca P. Ardigò of the University of Verona in Italy.</p>
<h3>Background effects</h3>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who likes to have background music playing while you work, there are a couple of studies worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p>Listening even to music that you enjoy <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.1731">can interfere with working memory</a>, which could impair mental arithmetic, a study published in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> has found. And though it has been suggested that music can encourage creativity, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3532">in fact it “significantly impairs” it</a>, according to a 2019 paper published in the same journal. The researchers, from the UK and Sweden, gave participants verbal insight problems, which are meant to tap into creativity. (For example, they were given the words “dress”, “dial”, and “flower”, and asked to identify a single word that could be combined with each — “sun”). Background music with foreign lyrics, instrumental music without lyrics and music with familiar lyrics <em>all </em>made the participants worse at this. Again, the researchers think that this is because music disrupts working memory; in this case, verbal working memory. “To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content, consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving,” they write.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the negative impact of familiar music was observed even when a participant said it boosted their mood, reported liking the song, or said that they typically studied with background music playing. So if you do typically work with music, and think it helps, surely it’s worth at least trying to go without.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>When it comes to leading a happy and fulfilled life, many of us focus on long-term goals: what job we want, whether or not we want children, or how to reach a certain level of skill at a particular hobby or interest. There’s a reason so much research looks at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/">how to achieve</a> the things you value in life.</p>
<p>As such, we often (try to) eschew short-term pleasures, deeming them a distraction from loftier goals. But according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220941998">a study in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a><em>, </em>the pursuit of those more immediate pleasures could be just as important for our wellbeing.</p>
<p><span id="more-40066"></span>The ability to engage in short term pleasures might not be the same for everybody, reasoned the researchers, Katharina Bernecker from the University of Zurich and Daniela Becker from Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien. In other words, some people may be more liable to fail at achieving short-term pleasurable goals because they’re too focused on long-term ones. So in the first study, the team developed a self-report scale to assess individual differences in this ability to pursue “hedonic” goals. Questions measured hedonic success, or how well people manage to pursue short term pleasures (e.g. “in my spare time, I can relax well”), and intrusive thoughts about long term goals whilst engaging in short term pleasures (e.g. “I cannot stop myself from thinking about things I still need to do”).</p>
<p>In the next pair of studies, the team used the scale to investigate whether people with high or low hedonic capacity experience greater wellbeing. In the first, participants answered questions from the World Health Organization wellbeing scale, which measures cognitive and emotional wellbeing, while in the second, participants completed the Satisfaction With Life scale, rating themselves on items like “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”. Hedonic capacity and self-control were assessed in both, as were physical symptoms (e.g. dizziness and faintness), including those of depression and anxiety (e.g. “nervousness or shakiness inside”).</p>
<p>Participants’ hedonic capacity was significantly and positively related to both general wellbeing and life satisfaction: people with a greater capacity to pursue short-term pleasures were also happier in their lives. Self-control (which is needed to achieve long-term goals) was also positively associated with wellbeing, but the effect of hedonic capacity was greater. Greater hedonic capacity was also related to fewer physical symptoms.</p>
<p>In a third study, hedonic capacity was measured before participants took place in a ten minute relaxation session, during which they stated how many intrusive thoughts they experienced. Before and after this session, participants rated how relaxed, tense, or alert they felt. As expected, those with higher levels of hedonic capacity experienced fewer intrusive thoughts during the relaxation phase; in addition, people who experienced more intrusive thoughts didn’t find the session as relaxing as those who did not.</p>
<p>To explore the findings in a real life setting, a fourth study recruited participants in specific contexts — e.g. a cafe, park or in a yoga class. Participants filled in a survey assessing their hedonic capacity and trait self-control, and indicated how much they were enjoying themselves in the moment and their reasons for being there. Companions of the participants also filled in a questionnaire judging the participants’ pleasure in the moment. Again, those with high hedonic capacity reported having a more positive experience and were also judged by others as having a better experience. A further study confirmed these findings.</p>
<p>So while a focus on long-term goals and self-control may increase wellbeing, it seems as if short-term pleasures are also a key factor — though intrusive thoughts can hamper this process, as results from the third study suggested.</p>
<p>Of course, self-control is important to some degree — giving in to every whim you experience probably isn’t going to equal a particularly healthy existence, as the team notes: a balance between the two is likely to result in higher levels of wellbeing.</p>
<p>If you’re the sort of person who finds it hard to enjoy short-term pleasures and are more likely to experience intrusive thoughts, this balance might be harder to come by than you might hope. But giving yourself permission to eat, drink and be merry could do more for your wellbeing than you might have expected.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></h4>

<p>How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?</p><p>Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.</p><p>So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.</p><p>First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.</p><p>Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.</p><p>Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.<strong> </strong>I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.</p><p>Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.</p><p>Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children<strong> </strong>better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues. Important for parents to let this information guide their conversations. Their teenagers will feel validated and supported.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/student-leaving-school-after-classes_1314101.htm">Image</a> by Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633749722/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/" rel="nofollow">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

The University of Münster in Germany shows with a good example how to act on evidence of data manipulation. Neuroscientist Andreas Püschel has been found guilty of research misconduct. It was once again about a paper authored by his former PhD student and now Luxembourg stem cell researcher, Jens Schwamborn.

Instead, we tend to rely on our intuitions and think of growth as linear even when it is not — which could help to explain why many people underestimated the dangers of coronavirus spreading. Researchers say that politicians and the media should be doing more to try and highlight the exponential nature of transmission in an attempt to correct this mathematical bias.<span id="more-40058"></span></p>

<p><strong>For a lot of the country, this week has been unpleasantly hot. </strong>And aside from the physical risks, heatwaves can have a variety of effects on our mental health, <a href="https://theconversation.com/heatwaves-dont-just-give-you-sunburn-they-can-harm-your-mental-health-too-121203">writes Harriet Ingle</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>

<p><strong>To combat global problems like climate change, we need to alter our behaviour in ways that might come at a personal cost, even though they benefit the wider community</strong>. So how do you encourage people to adopt these prosocial attitudes? Making people feel guilty is not the answer, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/you-want-people-to-do-the-right-thing-save-them-the-guilt-trip">explains Claudia R Schnieder</a> at <em>Psyche</em>. Her research has found that appealing to positive emotions, such as pride in doing the right thing, is more effective at encouraging pro-environmental and prosocial behaviours.</p>

<p><strong>Neuroscientists studying animals have traditionally examined how the brain responds to sensory information, or how patterns of brain activity directly relate to an animal’s behaviour. </strong>But now they’re beginning to look at something altogether more complex: the way in which neuronal activity is related to an animal’s internal state, such as its emotions or drives. At <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02337-x">Alison Abbott has written a fascinating feature</a> on the challenges of probing an animal’s frame of mind.</p>

<p><strong>A systematic review has found that, for a small number of people, mindfulness and meditation can have unwanted effects like a worsening of anxiety</strong>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2251840-mindfulness-and-meditation-can-worsen-depression-and-anxiety/">reports Clare Wilson</a> at <em>New Scientist</em>. Other researchers say that the study shouldn’t put people off doing meditation, but suggest they do it in a safe context such as guided meditation sessions. For more on mindfulness, it’s worth <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/">checking out our podcast</a> from last year.</p>

Researchers found that the sharks form groups of up to 20 individuals, who they hang out with for years. Being part of a social group gives the sharks certain advantages, such as learning from others where to hunt for food.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, I missed <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-correlation-causation-taboo">this piece</a> last month from Neuroskeptic (whose posts are always worth reading). </strong>We all know that correlation does not equal causation — but a paper argues that considering causal inference “taboo” simply results in psychologists making these claims in a more subtle or implicit way. The researchers examined influential studies based on observational data and, as Neuroskeptic puts it, “find evidence of unstated causal claims and assumptions, swept under a correlational rug.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a></h4>

<p>In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted">petitioned</a> for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder">granted clemency</a> and Brown was released from prison.</p><p>As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742">leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system</a>.</p><p>A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims</a>, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">told</a> her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.</p><p>Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color</a>, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10">which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights<em> </em>and pressure them to waive their rights</a>—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.</p><p>Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">often perceived</a> as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.</p><p>Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">often blamed</a> for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">more likely to be tried in adult criminal court</a> rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back">Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.</a></p><p>Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/">Image</a> by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/" rel="nofollow">How education could reduce corruption</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1">Food security</a> – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.</p>
<p>Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Food assistance</strong></p>
<p>Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/">prior studies</a> that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women</p></blockquote>
<p>Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing disparities</strong></p>
<p>This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.</p>
<p>Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ihd7XnvNt8g/">PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics</a></h4>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.</p>



<p>A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.</p>



<p>While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.</p>



<p>“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”</p>



<p>These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.</p>



<p>“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a></h4>

<p>One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/">report</a> by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.</p><p>The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.</p><p>This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”</p><p>A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards">criteria</a> for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths">myth</a> that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.</p><p>Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589">biologically-based disorders</a>, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">one study</a>, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.</p><p>We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">National Institutes of Health</a>, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm">tuberculosis</a>. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml">depression</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf">$69/person for schizophrenia</a> research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines">28 FDA-approved medications for depression</a> versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.</p><p>We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a></h4>

<p>A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600">investigated</a> which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21<sup>st</sup>-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.</p><p>The World Economic Forum’s <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">Future of Jobs Report 2018</a></em> took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.</p><p>These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">AP Computer Science Principles</a>. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.</p><p>The College Board <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles">announced</a> that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.</p><p>A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail">article</a> in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.</p><p>Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project">announced</a> that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.</p><p>A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf">approximately 30%</a> of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.</p><p>Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.</p><p><em>Featured Image credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/">Image</a> by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/" rel="nofollow">It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li></ul> </div>

It allows execution of networks of Izhikevich spiking neurons with realistic synaptic dynamics using multiple off-the-shelf GPUs and x86 CPUs. The simulator provides a PyNN-like programming interface in C/C++, which allows for details and parameters to be specified at the synapse, neuron, and network level.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The present release, CARLsim 5, builds on the efficiency and scalability of earlier releases (Nageswaran et al., 2009; Richert et al., 2011, and Beyeler et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2018).

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.</p><p>First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.<strong> </strong>Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/">Family Based Therapy</a>, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext">treatment approach of choice</a> for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.</p><p>Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.<strong> </strong>Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.<strong> </strong>The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.</p><p>Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/">negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors</a>. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/">body neutral is the place to aim</a>.<strong> </strong></p><p>Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It <em>is</em> important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is <em>not </em>their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.</p><p>Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm"><em>Image</em></a><em> by prostooleh via Freepik</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/" rel="nofollow">Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/person-409127_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Loneliness across life phases</strong></p>
<p>During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.</p>
<p>Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.</p>
<p>So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to deal with loneliness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness</p></blockquote>
<p>If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/">Leveraging Machine Learning to Fuel New Discoveries with the arXiv Dataset</a></h4>

<p>For nearly 30 years, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> has served the public and research communities by providing open access to scholarly articles, from the vast branches of physics to the many subdisciplines of computer science to everything in between, including math, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology, and economics.</p>
<p>The sheer number of arXiv research papers is both beneficial and challenging. Whether it’s a graduate student ramping up in her respective field, an established professor delving into adjacent ones, or researchers searching for big picture insights for the public good, this rich corpus of information offers significant, but sometimes overwhelming, depth.</p>
<p>To help make the arXiv more accessible, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">we present a free, open pipeline on Kaggle to the machine-readable arXiv dataset: a repository of 1.7 million articles</a>, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more.</p>
<p>“Having the entire arXiv corpus on Kaggle grows the potential of arXiv articles immensely,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “By offering the dataset on Kaggle we go beyond what humans can learn by reading all these articles and we make the data and information behind arXiv available to the public in a machine-readable format.”</p>
<p>Kaggle is a destination for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking interesting datasets, public notebooks, and competitions. Researchers can utilize Kaggle’s extensive data exploration tools and easily share their relevant scripts and output with others.</p>
<p>“arXiv is more than a repository of articles, it’s a platform for knowledge sharing,” said Presani. “This requires constant innovation on how we present and interpret the knowledge we make available. Kaggle users can help push the limits of this innovation and it can be a new outlet for our community to collaborate.”</p>
<p>“With large data sets, there is generally an expectation that there are likely to be overlooked discoveries, connections, innovative tools or perspectives, which may lead to additional insights, not just in the original subject, but across other fields of study, enabling yet more discovery and innovation,” said Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director.</p>
<p><b>Call to Action</b></p>
<p>Our hope is to empower new use cases that can lead to the exploration of richer machine learning techniques that combine multi-modal features towards applications like trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, co-citation networks, knowledge graph construction, and semantic search interfaces.</p>
<p>An example of such a semantic search application built on top of a specific corpus would be <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/an-nlu-powered-tool-to-explore-covid-19.html">Google’s COVID-19 Research Explorer</a>, a tool that helps researchers pore through the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">CORD-19 dataset</a> – a repository of 190,000+ science articles on COVID-19. Interfaces built on datasets such as this leverage advanced NLU techniques to understand a user’s <i>intent</i> behind a query. Ultimately, this can enable more efficient research by surfacing relevant data and evidence to complex, scientific questions. We hope the release of the machine-readable arXiv dataset will inspire the creation of similar NLU tools over this new corpus.</p>
<p>Alex Alemi, Senior Research Scientist at Google, has also pursued more exciting applications of ML using the arXiv. As described in the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00075.pdf"><i>On the Use of arXiv as a Dataset</i></a> , Alex and his colleagues sought to propel the arXiv as a benchmark for large scale, multi-relational tasks, such as with graph neural networks.  “I’m excited to see the research community rise to the challenge of a rich, multifaceted dataset with so much real-world practicality, and the new questions this will raise,” says Alex.</p>
<p><b>Access</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">The dataset is now available on Kaggle</a> and will be updated weekly. Please send us your feedback and stay tuned for additional updates!</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/lgbt-4115612_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Aging is a major risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases, which include diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and arthritis. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04188.x">More than half</a> of older adults in the US have <em>three or more</em> chronic diseases. Having multiple chronic diseases can increase the chances for disability, hospitalization, and death.</p>
<p>Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults are an under-served population that experience health disparities often related to a lifetime of stressors such as stigma, discrimination, and oppression. As such, this is a population with many barriers to receiving patient-centered health care. With aging, middle-aged and older LGB adults are therefore likely to be at risk not only for medical diseases, but also other chronic conditions.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>To examine chronic diseases in this population, we used data from the US <a href="https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm">National Survey of Drug Use and Health</a> to determine the extent of three chronic conditions: mental illness, unhealthy substance use, and having two or more medical diseases. We then looked at the presence of having more than one of these conditions among LGB adults age 50 and older. We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.</p>
<p>These results highlight the complex health needs of this population. It is important to recognize that while medical and public health interventions usually focus on one condition, this is often not appropriate for older adults with multiple chronic diseases. A patient-centered coordinated approach is needed that considers how each condition is interrelated with other coexisting diseases. Unhealthy substance use and mental illness for example can complicate the management of chronic medical diseases and lead to poorer health outcomes.</p>
<p>The care of older adults, especially for communities that are under-served, such as sexual minority populations, needs to involve patient-centered care that considers all chronic diseases and how they may be related. For older LGB adults we also need a greater awareness of all possible forms of stigma related to people such as older individuals and those of sexual minority status, and we must understand how this may impact health.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to not further stigmatize but to draw attention to the needs of older adults from communities who have been neglected and under-served so that they can receive better care through improved awareness of the multiple factors that affect health and well-being.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/cure-1006810_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics</strong></p>
<p>Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s, there have been over 150 antibacterial drugs developed and marketed for human or veterinary use. The effect these drugs have had on infectious diseases and population health is remarkable. A once considered serious bacterial infection can now be successfully managed using antibiotics prescribed from the doctor. This was not always the case, as our grandparents may testify: bacterial infections were often fatal and the choices available to manage such infections were limited.</p>
<blockquote><p>Doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>This “golden age” of discovery may, however, soon come to an end, as more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to the antibiotics available to us. It is for this reason that healthcare organizations across the world have been focusing on developing stewardship policies to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics. In England, the situation is no different, and the Department of Health and Social Care have developed an antimicrobial resistance strategy. As part of the plan, doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so. As the majority of antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, healthcare providers working in this setting are set specific prescribing targets.</p>
<p>It is important to establish if the polices are working from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, but also that these polices are fair, and do not penalize communities in the most need of care. Our work aimed to address these questions. To do this, we used antibiotic prescribing data from the NHS, as well as working out the characteristics of the local areas in England using nationally available data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, we found that, in England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working: since 2014, antibiotic prescribing has reduced by around 14 per cent.  We also found that prescribing of certain classes of antibiotics, namely those considered broad spectrum, have also reduced.</p>
<p>When we considered local factors in our analysis, we showed that the most deprived areas of England had the highest levels of antibiotic prescribing.  When we adjusted for two long-term conditions – diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – both of which are associated with increased antibiotic use, we still found higher levels of antibiotic prescribing in the most deprived areas of England.  We also showed that geography was an important factor too: compared to London, all other areas of England had higher levels of antibiotic prescribing – with the East of England, and the North East of England having the highest levels.</p>
<p><strong>Considering local needs</strong></p>
<p>You might ask why this is important? Well, that’s a good question.  Our work shows that in addition to a national strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing, it is important to consider local needs too. People living in more deprived areas might, for example, might have greater health need for antibiotics compared to people living in more affluent areas.  National one-sized-fits all targets might not necessarily account for this. If there is greater antibiotic need in deprived areas, doctors working in these areas might be unfairly penalized for prescribing them.  This is not fair on the doctors working in primary care, but may also impact on patients too.</p>
<p>The antibiotic stewardship polices appear to be reducing overall antibiotic prescribing, which is a positive thing, although there is still significant variation in prescribing across England.  It would be appropriate for future prescribing targets to account for local factors to ensure the most deprived communities are not inappropriately penalized.</p>
<p>The bottom line is if someone is in medical need of an antibiotic, they should be prescribed it, regardless of the characteristics of their local area or where they live.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/">$ How to profit from COVID-19 testing $</a></h4>

<p>Rapid testing has been a powerful tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks around the world (see <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iceland</a>, <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch209004" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Germany</a>, …). While many countries support testing through government sponsored healthcare infrastructure, in the United States COVID-19 testing has largely been organized and provided by for-profit businesses. While financial incentives coupled with social commitment have motivated many scientists and engineers at companies and universities to work hard around the clock to facilitate testing, there are also many individuals who have succumbed to greed. Opportunism has bubbled to the surface and scams, swindles, rackets, misdirection and fraud abound. This is happening at a time when workplaces are in desperate need of testing, and demands for testing are likely to increase as schools, colleges and universities start opening up in the next month. Here are some examples of what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost there is your basic fraud. In July, a company called “Fillakit”, which had been <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus-contracts/contracts/70FB7020D00000029" rel="noopener" target="_blank">awarded a $10.5 million federal contract</a> to make COVID-19 test kits, was <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-ordered-10-2-million-in-covid-19-testing-kits-its-now-warning-states-not-to-use" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shipping unusable, contaminated, soda bottles</a>. This “business”, started by some law and real estate guy called <a href="https://kiowacountypress.net/content/closer-look-federal-covid-contractors-reveals-inexperience-fraud-accusations-and-weapons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paul Wexler, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-test-kit-maker-dissolves-amid-probes-11594153304" rel="noopener" target="_blank">went under two months after it launched</a> amidst a slew of investigations and complaints from former workers. Oh, BTW, <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87789" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michigan ordered 322,000 Fillakit tubes</a> which went straight to the trash (as a result they could not do a week worth of tests).</li>
<li>Not all fraud is large scale. Some former VP at now defunct “Cure Cannabis Solutions” ordered 100 COVID-19 test kits that do who-knows-what at a price of 50c a kit. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/feds-seize-100-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits-shipped-from-china-addressed-to-portland-man-with-prior-ties-to-cannabis-industry.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Feds seized it</a>. These kits, which were not FDA approved, were sourced from “Anhui DeepBlue Medical” in Hefei, China.</li>
<li>To be fair, the Cannabis guy was small fry. In Laredo Texas, some guy called Robert Castañeda received assistance from a <em>congressman</em> to purchase $500,000 of kits from the same place! Anhui DeepBlue Medical sent Castańeda 20,000 kits ($25 a test). Apparently <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/he-spent--500-000-to-buy-coronavirus-tests-health-officials-say-theyre-unreliable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the tests had 20% accuracy.</a> To his credit, the Cannabis guy paid 1/50th the price for this junk.</li>
<li>Let’s not forget who is really raking in the bucks though. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the primary testing outfits in the US right now; each is processing around 150,000 tests a day. These are for-profit companies and indeed they are making a profit. The economics is simple: insurance companies reimburse LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics for the tests. The rates are basically determined by the amount that Medicare will pay, i.e. the government price point. Intiially, the reimbursement was set at $51, and well… at that price LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics just <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/30/coronavirus-testing-stunted-low-medicare-reimbursement/3048943001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weren’t that interested</a>. I mean, people have to put food on the table, right? (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=205179230701958" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adam Schechter</a>, CEO of LabCorp makes $4.9 million a year; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=241018100270891" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve Rusckowski</a>, CEO of Quest Diagnostics, makes $9.9 million a year). So the Medicare reimbursement rate was raised to $100. The thing is, LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics get paid regardless of how long it takes to return test results. <a href="https://abc7.com/coronavirus-los-angeles-california-testing-long-wait-for-covid-19/6341394/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Some people are currently waiting 15 days to get results</a> (narrator: such tests results are useless).</li>
<li>Perhaps a silver lining lies in the stock price of these companies. The title of this post is “$ How to Profit From COVID-19 Testing $”. I guess being able to take a week or two to return a test result and still get paid $100 for something that cost $30 lifts the stock price… and you can profit!<img alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM" class=" size-full wp-image-14474 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="14474" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png" data-orig-size="2496,1326" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-03-23-am/" height="1326" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png" width="2496" /></li>
<li>Let’s not forget the tech bros! <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A bunch of dudes in Utah from companies like Nomi, Domo and Qualtrics signed a two-month contract with the state of Utah to provide 3,000 tests a day</a>. One of the tech executives pushing the initiative, called <a href="https://www.testutah.com/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TestUtah</a>, was a 37-year old founder (of Nomi Health) by the name of Mark Newman. He admitted that “none of us knew anything about lab testing at the start of the effort”. Didn’t stop Newman et al. from signing more than $50 million in agreements with several states to provide testing. tl;dr: the tests had a poor limit of detection, samples were mishandled, throughput was much lower than promised etc. etc. and as a result they weren’t finding positive cases at rates similar to other testing facilities. The significance is summarized poignantly in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New Yorker piece about the debacle</a>:<br />
<blockquote><p>“I might be sick, but I want to go see my grandma, who’s ninety-five. So I go to a TestUtah site, and I get tested. TestUtah tells me I’m negative. I go see grandma, and she gets sick from me because my result was wrong, because TestUtah ran an unvalidated test.”</p></blockquote>
<p>P.S. There has been <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/utah-adds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a disturbing TestUtah hydroxycholorquine story going on behind the scenes</a>. I include this fact because no post on fraud and COVID-19 would be complete without a mention of hydroxycholoroquine.</p></li>
<li>Maybe though, the tech bros will save the day. The recently launched <a href="https://xprize.org/prizes/covidtesting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$5 million COVID-19 X-prize</a> is supposed to incentivize the development of “Frequent. Fast. Cheap. Easy.” COVID-19 testing. The goal is nothing less than to “radically change the world.” I’m hopeful, but I just hope they don’t <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/10-million-genomics-x-prize-canceled-outpaced-innovation-8C10990757" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancel it like they did the genome prize</a>. After all, their goal of “500 tests per week with 12 hour turnaround from sample to result” is likely to be outpaced by innovation just like what happened with genome sequencing. So in terms of making money from COVID-19 testing don’t hold your breath with this prize.</li>
<li>As is evident from the examples above, one of the obstacles to quick riches with COVID-19 testing in the USA is the FDA. The thing about COVID-19 testing is that lying to the FDA on applications, or providing unauthorized tests, can lead to unpleasantries, e.g. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jail</a>. So some play it straight and narrow. Consider, for example, <a href="https://seqonce.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SeqOnce</a>, which has developed the <a href="https://seqonce.com/azureseq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Azureseq SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit</a>. These guys have an “EUA-FDA validated test”: <img alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14476" data-attachment-id="14476" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png" data-orig-size="2336,2130" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-14-45-am/" height="2130" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png" width="2336" /><br />
This is exactly what you want! You can click on “Order Now” and pay $3,000 for a kit that can be used to test several hundred samples (great price!) and the site has all the necessary information: IFUs (these are “instructions for use” that come with FDA authorized tests), validation results etc. If you look carefully you’ll see that administration of the test requires FDA approval. The company is upfront about this. Except the test is not FDA authorized; this is easy to confirm by examining <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the FDA Coronavirus EUA site</a>. One can infer from a <a href="https://seqonce.com/seqonce-biosciences-launches-azureseq-one-step-universal-sars-cov-2-rt-qpcr-kit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> that they have <em>submitted</em> an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) but while they claim it has been <em>validated</em>, nowhere does it say it has been <em>authorized.</em>Clever eh? <em>Authorized,</em> <em>validated, authorized, validated, authorized, .. </em>and here I was just about to spend $3,000 for a bunch of tests that cannot be currently legally administered. <strong>Whew</strong>!At least this is not fraud. Maybe it’s better called… I don’t know… a game? Other companies are playing similar games. <a href="https://www.concentricbyginkgo.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gingko Bioworks is advertising “testing at scale, supporting schools and businesses” with an “Easy to use FDA-authorized test”</a> but again this seems to be a product that has “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-06-19/ginkgo-bioworks-ceo-on-new-covid-19-testing-initiative-video" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched</a>“, not one that, you know, actually exists; I could find no Gingko Bioworks test that works at scale that is authorized on the FDA Coronavirus EUA website, and it turns out that what they mean by FDA authorized is <a href="https://twitter.com/jrkelly/status/1273704377665101838?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an RT-PCR test that they have outsourced to others</a>.  Fingers crossed though- maybe the marketing helped CEO Jason Kelly <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/28/business/ginkgo-raises-70-million-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-employers-universities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raise the $70 million</a> his company has received for the effort; I certainly hope it works (soon)!</li>

Just one sec… <strong>what is up with biotech startups and 100% men leadership teams? </strong>See <a href="http://www.epinomics.co/team-bios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epinomics</a>, <a href="http://www.insightgenetics.com/about/management-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Insight Genetics</a>, <a href="https://oceangenomics.com/team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ocean Genomics</a>, <a href="https://www.kailosgenetics.com/our-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kailos Genetics</a>, <a href="https://circulogene.com/leadership-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Circulogene</a>, etc. etc.)… And what’s up with the black and white thing? Is that to try to hide that there are no people of color?<br />
I mention the 100% male team because if you look at all the people mentioned in this post, all of them are guys (except the person in the next sentence), and I didn’t plan that, it just how it worked out. Look, I’m not casting shade on the former CEO of Theranos. I’m just saying that there is a strong correlation here.<p></p>
<p>Sorry, back to the regular programming…</p></li>
<li>Speaking of swindlers and scammers, this post would not be complete without a mention of the COVID-19 testing czar, Jared Kushner. His secret testing plan for the United States went “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air" rel="noopener" target="_blank">poof into thin air</a>“! I felt that the 1 million contaminated and unusable Chinese test kits that he ordered for <em>$52 million</em> deserved the final mention in this post. Sadly, these failed kits appear to be the main thrust of the federal response to COVID-19 testing needs so far, and consistent with Trump’s recent call to, “slow the testing down” (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/donald-trump-testing-slow-down-response/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he wasn’t kidding</a>). Let’s see what turns up today at the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110912?s=1&amp;r=50" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hearings of the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus</a>, whose agenda is “The Urgent Need for a National Plan to Contain the Coronavirus”.</li>

When first introduced, the attraction of the Big Deal was immediately obvious, since it allows a library to buy its faculty access to most, if not all, of a publisher’s journals at a much lower “cost per article” (discounted) rate. From the start, however, there were doubters.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i></i></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1024/ShannonPritting.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="170" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/w256-h170/ShannonPritting.jpg" width="256" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Shannon Pritting<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In 2001, the Director of Libraries at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Kenneth Frazier, </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/frazier/03frazier.html"><i><span lang="EN-GB">warned</span></i></a></span><i><span> the library community of the dangers of signing big deals, or any comprehensive licensing agreement, with commercial publishers.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>“The current generation of library directors is engaged in a dangerous ‘game’ in which short-term institutional benefits are achieved at the long-term expense of the academic community,” he warned, adding that big deals would weaken libraries’ ability to manage their journal collections, foist on them journals they “neither need nor want” and increase their dependence on publishers “who have already shown their determination to monopolize the information marketplace.”</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Nevertheless, many libraries did sign big deals. And many later regretted it, not least because, having done so, they felt they had no choice but to keep renewing the contract, even as the cost kept going up and devoured more and more of their budget. </span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Libraries felt trapped, conscious that if they did not renew they would have to go back to subscribing to individual journals at list price, which would mean being able to afford access to fewer journals, and fearful that when they discovered that journals they wanted were no longer available, faculty would revolt.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Over time, however, a </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/05/01/wolf-finally-arrives-big-deal-cancelations-north-american-libraries/"><i><span lang="EN-GB">greater willingness</span></i></a></span><i><span> to think the unthinkable emerged, and some libraries began to cancel their big deals. And when they did so the sky did not fall in – which allowed other libraries to take heart.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>The list maintained </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0"><i><span lang="EN-GB">here</span></i></a></span><i><span> suggests that libraries began cancelling their big deals as long ago as 2008, but the number doing so has been accelerating in the last few years. What has really focussed minds are the recent decisions by both the </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x"><i><span lang="EN-GB">University of California</span></i></a></span><i><span> and </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611#.XuJLLWKW_k0.twitter"><i><span lang="EN-GB">MIT</span></i></a></span><i><span> to walk away from their negotiations with Elsevier rather than renew their big deals.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>But it is not necessary to walk away completely in the way UC and MIT have done. Instead, libraries can “unbundle” their Big Deal by replacing the large package of several thousand journals they are subscribed to with a small à la carte bundle of a few hundred journals, and in the process save themselves a great deal of money.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>What is helping libraries to make the decision to unbundle is the knowledge that more and more research is becoming available on an open access basis. In addition, new tools like </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://unsub.org/"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Unsub</span></i></a></span><i><span> are available to advise them on which journals they can cancel without too great an impact, and which journals are essential and so should be retained. </span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Given the big savings that can be realised, and the pressure library budgets are under, unbundling is expected to grow, particularly in light of the straitened circumstances that libraries will find themselves in after </span></i><i><span>the pandemic.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>This year a number of US universities have unbundled in favour of smaller packages of journals, including </span></i><span><i><a href="https://library.unc.edu/2020/04/upcoming-elsevier-cancellations/">UNC Chapel Hill</a>, <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.lib.iastate.edu/elsevier&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">Iowa State University</a> and the State University of New York (<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://slcny.libguides.com/slc/elsevier2020update&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">SUNY</a>) -- a system of 64 institutions. Coming in the wake of UC</i></span><i><span lang="EN-US">’s</span></i><i> decision to walk away from Elsevier these </i><i><span>“</span></i><i>little deals</i><i><span>”</span></i><i> have attracted a lot of attention. </i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In Europe, by contrast, there is a </span></i><span><i><a href="https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/">greater focus</a> right no on signing <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">transformative agreements</a>. In addition to providing reading rights, these new-style big deals include prepaid publishing rights to allow faculty to publish their articles on an open access basis. Amongst other things, these deals help assuage concerns about <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">double dipping</a> (where a university may end up paying both article-processing charges and subscriptions for the same journals). </i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>So how is a decision to unbundle made, and what are the issues and implications of making the decision? To get a clearer picture I spoke recently by email with Shannon Pritting, Shared Library Services Platform Project Director at SUNY. In April, SUNY replaced its Big Deal of 2,200 journals with Elsevier with a “little deal” of just 248 journals. By doing so, it says, it has saved about $7 million.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Unbundling raises a lot of questions, and I suspect we may not have answers to all of the questions for some time.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>For instance, as more and more universities unbundle, how accurate will the calculations informing the decisions about which journals to give up and which to keep prove to be over time? This could have implications for, amongst other things, how much of the money that has been saved will need to be spent on obtaining paywalled articles through Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and document delivery services.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Moreover, since unbundling </span></i><span><i><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0">appears</a> currently to be mainly a US thing (with Europe favouring transformative agreements) might we see a geographical divide emerge? If we do, what might the implications of this be, especially for the open access movement?</i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In addition, might unbundling encourage more researchers to use illegal services like Sci-Hub, and might unbundling see university libraries marginalised to some extent, especially if they do not play an active role in funding open access?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Please read on for the interview. </span></i></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span><br /></span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: SUNY consists of 64 campuses I believe.

Of the papers SUNY researchers can access under the new arrangement, the calculation was that 30% of the papers that faculty are likely to need access to are available open access and, thanks to a post-termination agreement (PTA) with Elsevier, 25% will remain freely available to faculty from Elsevier. This does not imply that 45% will need to be ordered via document delivery services right?</span></i></b></h3><div><b><i><span><br /></span></i></b></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>SUNY partnered with Unsub (at the time Unpaywall Journals) to model costs and access options if we decided to cancel or unbundle our Elsevier Big Deal. The percentage you mention of 45% of content not being immediately accessible isn’t something that the Unsub data generally provided as a data point. Although the Unsub data varied by journal, the percentage that wouldn’t be immediately accessible was typically below 20%.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Although there was a lot of scepticism about the reliability of Unsub data and modelling in predicting costs post-cancellation, the tool and services helped us to think critically about all other data we were using to determine value. In the end, most SUNYs found that Unsub data was useful, and as reliable as other sources that we were using to determine the value of a big deal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Certainly, Post-Termination Access helps with providing immediate access. However, I don’t think that any campus expects that either 45% or 20% of the usage would translate into document delivery purchases. Everyone understands that journal usage data is inflated, flawed, and doesn’t reflect true usage and value. Yet, most forecasts of costs after cancellation or unbundling are based on vendor provided usage data.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>So we expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing the Big Deal to a smaller, focused package. And, if libraries find that users are requesting via ILL or document delivery a high amount of articles from any specific journal, they can always subscribe to a single journal if it’s cost effective.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Overall, the strategy was that the big deal provides access to a lot of content, but our big deal wasn’t an effective use of our money; it was worth it to see what actually happens after we changed our subscription.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>And, I expect that we’ll see the same trends and results that other consortia and libraries have seen: a cancellation of a big deal doesn’t lead to resulting increased costs for article purchasing or ILL that is anywhere near what a subscription to that large set of journals costs. Most users will find alternative sources as the user usually doesn’t need a specific article, but just needs an article that is relevant to the topic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>In the end, SUNY’s decision was based on the simple equation of whether 2,200 journals was worth the amount we were paying for the Big Deal, and not the fear of what the costs would be for guaranteeing the same type of access to the 2,200 journals as we had when we subscribed to the bundle.  Just as important as determining whether we could provide access to papers we would lose from the bundled titles was determining how many of these 2,200 journals we needed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>This work took just as much time or more than cost modelling. It involved outreach by many librarians with faculty and administration across SUNY. SUNY also hosted several coordinated open forums with faculty about the Elsevier deal, and engaged with Faculty governance and administration at the system and campus levels. Certainly usage data informed the journals we targeted for the 248, but equally important was input from our user community that was led by librarians.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We certainly had to walk through various data-driven scenarios of costs after cancellation, value of the package based on usage (and what journals were most important) to ensure we were gathering input and managing the change that comes from moving away from a Big Deal. But, the decision for SUNY was based on whether we valued the journals enough to pay the amount the vendor required us to pay to maintain that access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>In the end, it wasn’t in the best interests of SUNY to continue with the Big Deal.</span><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Individual title subscriptions</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: As you indicate, </span></i></b><b><i><span>the Elsevier unbundled deal assumes that any campus or department that needs access to journals not in the smaller bundle can subscribe separately.

This funding would be coming from the individual library budget, and would be funded with savings from the difference between what the library would have contributed to the previous big deal and the smaller 248 title deal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>There have been very few individual title subscriptions for Elsevier titles that were lost in the change to the smaller unbundled deal. The global pandemic began to impact the US just after the new unbundled deal was finalized, which resulted in libraries immediately beginning to limit spending, and then begin to cut budgets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>The savings from the change from the Big Deal to an unbundled deal provided campuses with the ability to weather drastic cuts, and many used the savings to help meet the need to quickly cut spending and budgets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Presumably the figure of 25% of articles that will be freely available as a result of the PTA with Elsevier will grow over time, in line with the number of new papers published in Elsevier journals that are not covered by the PTA?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>There will be some growth in the percentage of content that our users may want, but don’t have immediate access to as our Post Termination access grows less current. However, the percent increase and the costs of access will not be enough of a percentage to come close to the difference in what our previous deal cost our institutions, and what our current subscription will cost.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY would prefer to look at the aggregate savings built by the years it will take for our PTA to age as a major advantage to unbundling. In essence, as the industry shifts and more consortia and large libraries break subscriptions, the market for journal access will only be more advantageous to the subscriber in the future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Thinking of growth over time in the amount of content that our users can’t access via PTA, or a subscription, assumes that the value of a subscription or journal package will only grow. It’s clear that the value of big deals is declining, so future deals should only be more advantageous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>If SUNY does find it more cost effective to enter into another big deal or “re-bundle” what it recently unbundled, future deals should be better than the deal we had, which was based on historical metrics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Of those papers that will be available open access how many do you estimate will be the Version of Record (VoR) and how many are likely to be self-archived versions – e.g. preprint, Authors Accepted Manuscript (AAM), or </span></i></b><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/research/open-access/open-access-and-the-ref/understanding-versions-of-your-paper/%5d"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">some other version</span></i></b></a></span><b><i><span> that is not the VoR?

Can you say which services are used and how many documents on average are ordered each year via a) ILL and b) document delivery services? How do you expect those figures to change going forward?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP:</span></b><span>Our primary vendor for document delivery is Reprints Desk. A few institutions also use Copyright Clearance Center’s “Get it Now” service, but this is only for a small percentage of the document delivery volume. SUNY Libraries use the lowest cost vendor for document delivery, and for all but a few percent of articles, Reprints Desk is the lowest cost option.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Based on 5 years of ILL data (2015-19) SUNY has 300,000 total ILL requests per year (both lending and borrowing) for books and articles. Considering that half of ILL requests are for articles, and half of the requests are lending, about 100,000 requests are for ILL articles per year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Over this five-year span, total ILL volume has decreased a few percent per year. I expect that the total volume of ILL will continue to decrease, especially for articles. Every consortium that has cancelled big deals has found that there has been little impact on overall ILL volume.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Of the 100,000 articles requested in SUNY each year, about 25% are for content published within the last five years, which has the potential to incur costs for access. ILL departments are already doing a fine job providing access to current content as a supplement or alternative to subscriptions, and will be a reliable source to provide access for any content that is needed but not available via subscription.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY libraries have regularly found that providing access to journals via ILL and document delivery is more cost effective than subscribing to journals that have high subscription costs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY doesn’t currently have data on how many document delivery purchases are made per year, but we are working with our primary document delivery provider to gather this data to use as another point of consideration when we consider access options.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Do you have any sense of how much SUNY libraries generally pay for document delivery and ILL services each year?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>The amount that SUNY pays for document delivery and ILL services each year varies between institutions. Typically, smaller institutions don’t pay for document delivery, with our largest few institutions paying from $50,000 to $100,000. But we don’t currently have reliable detailed data on this document delivery spending in aggregate across our 60 institutions as each campus pays separately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Although our campuses will continue to decrease the amount of content such as journals that they license, we expect to see only a slight increase in document delivery costs. Users typically find alternative paths to journal articles if libraries don’t subscribe, whether it’s open access or alternative versions of a paper.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Document delivery is used only in limited circumstances, and we expect the percentage of articles that are available without a subscription to continue to increase. Most of the SUNYs also have enabled Unpaywall integration in their link resolvers, so open access is provided as an option whenever possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: </span></i></b><b><i><span>I understand it costs between $35 and $40 per article to order via Reprints Desk.

Does that sound about right?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>We have reasonably reliable data about the number of transactions where campuses have paid copyright (which in this case includes purchasing the article from a document delivery provider) and the number is 16,250 per year. Your estimate of $35-$40 per article is fair, so our document delivery and copyright spending would be roughly $568,750 dollars per year. However, some of the heaviest requested publications such as Nature, and even Elsevier publications, cost less than $25 per article.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We think that there is a fair amount of open access that gets purchased or requested via ILL, especially in hybrid journals. This is why we’re excited that Reprints Desk has an open access filter that some libraries are using. As you’re likely aware, finding open access in hybrid publications is often not easy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Using your estimate of $8-10 per article for ILL, which I find reasonable, you’re correct that the spending on ILL for articles ordered from other libraries via resource sharing would be around $670,000 per year.  SUNY continues to try to minimize this cost by assessing costs of resource sharing systems and networks to ensure that we’re getting our best value for the resource sharing we need to serve our users.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>When we were using the Unsub post-cancellation cost modelling tool, they defaulted to $17 per request based on older estimates from ILL literature. Even with this higher ILL estimate, the model still indicated that most of our campuses should subscribe to only a small group of journals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Ok, so as a rough estimate we can say that SUNY Libraries are receiving about 100,000 article requests a year from faculty. Of these about 16,250 will be supplied via document delivery services (at a cost of around $568,750) and some 83,750 will be supplied via ILL (at a cost of about $670,000). So the total cost of fulfilling individual article requests will be around $1.238 million a year. </span></i></b><b><i><span>Does SUNY operate a mediated document delivery service, or can faculty go online and order documents without the library needing to be involved?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>Some SUNY institutions provide an unmediated document delivery service, typically facilitated through an ILL workflow.

As many STEM publishers use metrics that utilize types and level of programs for subscription rates, document delivery is an attractive option to provide access to resources as subscription costs are often beyond the ability of these small campuses to afford.</span><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Illegal services and big deals</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: You say you </span></i></b><b><i><span>expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing from a big deal to a smaller deal because “Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.” Is there any concern that by unbundling the library could encourage users to access illegal services like Sci-Hub?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>Certainly, SUNY values the work that publishers do, including Elsevier. SUNY wishes to continue its relationship with Elsevier moving forward, as we’ll continue for multiple years to have at least a group of 248 titles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>However, I think what unbundling does is focus the review not purely on cost per use, which inflates the value of a subscription. This point has been </span><span>on </span><span>Instead, the focus becomes more on the value of the usage you’re getting for the amount you’re paying, not purely letting usage drive the value discussion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>By looking at link resolver data you can find that users often land on records of articles to which they have access, load the pdf into a browser, but never engage with the article. So, with content they do not have access to they may come to a record but never take the next step of ordering the article via ILL.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>We realize that the best case scenario for everyone would be that bundles of the highest quality content were available at prices that were slowly decreasing to acknowledge that the cost of IT infrastructure is going down, so journal hosting prices should go down. But, that’s not the offers that are typically coming from publishers. Library budgets, at least in SUNY, are declining, so increasing costs lead us to make tough decisions about which of the subscriptions to cut.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>The proposition that unbundling will lead to more use of illegal access and that this is a problem that the library or libraries should solve isn’t one that is fair to libraries. It’s not that libraries are seeking to offer less content to their users; they just can’t afford increasing prices.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>We hope that, instead of illegal services becoming more common open access and open science becomes more prevalent and shifts the readership models to open access rather than Sci-Hub or models that aren’t connected to legitimate organizations.</span><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: How many big deals does SUNY currently have and with whom?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>SP:</span></b><span> SUNY is not a consortium that has historically collaborated on big deals for content. This is partially due to the diversity of types of institutions, and partially due to capacity at the central office. The Elsevier Big Deal was the only major full-text deal SUNY had.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>SUNY has historically had a large package of aggregator content labelled </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.sunyconnect.suny.edu/about.html"><span lang="EN-GB">SUNYConnect</span></a></span><span> that all campuses subscribe to. However, beyond the Elsevier deal and SUNYConnect, there is currently very little content that the 60 institutions or large groups within the system coordinate purchasing on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>SUNY is working to do more coordinated collection activity, and will consider big deals if the offer is appropriate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>However, with most big deals, there is such a wide variety of content that we don’t anticipate finding many deals that will benefit enough of SUNY to pursue. The overall management overhead for big deals is also something we thought about in depth as we moved from the Elsevier big deal to an unbundled group.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>With smaller unbundled coordinated collecting, the opportunity to change strategies or to cancel is less overwhelming, and outweighs the benefit of access to journals in bulk.</span><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Transformative agreements</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: Has SUNY signed any transformative agreements? If so, with whom? If not does it plan to?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>SP:</span></b><span> SUNY as a system, or as individual institutions, has not signed any transformative agreements. At this point, it seems unlikely that SUNY would enter into any large-scale transformative agreements in the near future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>The culture and organizational structure of SUNY is such that individual authors have been paying open access fees. Although SUNY libraries are largely supportive of movements towards open such as open access and open educational resources, the financial implications of transformative agreements would be difficult for most SUNY libraries to justify.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>SUNY library budgets will continue to be negatively impacted, so the focus will likely be on getting the most relevant access over the next 3-5 years. However, SUNY will continue to ask for terms and discounts for publishing open access as much as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>When a commitment to dedicate funds away from current access to supporting open access comes into play with negotiations, SUNY will likely continue to prioritize current access. An overlooked portion of the SUNY-Elsevier unbundled deal was a </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/suny-elsevier-deal.html"><span lang="EN-GB">10% discount</span></a></span><span> on Elsevier APCs for SUNY Authors, which is typical of the approach we’ll likely be taking with other deals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>If we can include terms that are advantageous to authors moving towards open access, we’ll do so, but won’t sacrifice access or incur more costs to move from a read to read and publish strategy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: You say that SUNY libraries are not responsible for paying any gold OA fees and that payment data is not centrally managed.

Why wouldn’t libraries see this not as a referendum on the value of the library, but as an indicator of how much the exact content they were subscribing to mattered. I realize things are always complex in these situations, but libraries shouldn’t tie up their value with keeping specific subscriptions. Libraries offer so much more than just access to articles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Regarding risking being marginalized if SUNY doesn’t focus on transformative agreements or continuing to find ways to subscribe to large journal packages: I agree that unbundling should signal a shift in how libraries focus on access. And, SUNY certainly isn’t against transformative agreements or subscribing to bundles of journals that make sense financially.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>However, focusing on licensing agreements with publishers as the main vehicle will likely lead to further issues in the future where libraries again cannot sustain the costs of the endeavours they’re focusing on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY will be focusing on ways we can help our system’s faculty and staff participate more in open access publishing to make their intellectual property and research more accessible to all.  We can be sure that publishers and vendors will be partners with us as we begin to move more into open access strategies. But, APCs and transformative agreements should be analysed in our overall context regarding increasing access for SUNY faculty, staff, and students and making the output of SUNY faculty, staff, and students more accessible to the larger community.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Certainly, ILL and availability of articles is something to be aware of, especially if more large subscription reductions and unbundling continue. ILL departments have seen staffing reductions, which has led to a focus on streamlining workflows, and has brought about a decade’s worth of focus in ILL (at least in the US) that has seen most of the innovation going towards automation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>What ILL has lacked is a large-scale investment in focusing on the larger ecosystem, which includes better terms in licensing and the ability to offer new services rather than just offering the same services more efficiently. But, I think there’s going to be a real shift in libraries moving more towards collections services, which includes ILL.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>For example, Princeton has adopted this model, which focuses on both access and collections. There needs to be better structural support for ILL, so that consortial coordination of collection and access for things like journals can happen. SUNY discussed all of this when we were considering unbundling, and although we focused for the past six months on showing libraries how to arrange and configure alternative access, we’re at a point now where we can focus on more structural issues that use multiple data points when making collection decisions or setting strategic directions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>This spirit has been strong in SUNY with coordinated collection development via resource sharing and demand driven acquisitions for books for some time, with many libraries seeking to diversify SUNY’s collection if a title isn’t available in SUNY.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We’re hoping that we can coordinate journal access in a similar way, where we have programs where SUNYs cooperate on what journals they subscribe to in order to provide the best access to e-journals for all of SUNY.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Additionally, vendors will likely be offering more in the way of access options that allows consortia to blend ILL-like access and subscriptions.

People with poor to no visual imagery were more likely to choose a scientific or mathematical occupation. These categories are rather broad, however. For instance, “media” includes print media. And artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly do exist.<br /><br />The study had a number of limitations, e.g. washing out individual differences and relying on introspection for rating visual imagery ability (as noted by the authors). There are more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303581" target="_blank" title="binocular rivalry">objective ways</a> to test for imagery, but these involve in-person visits.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology/">Exploring hypothetical thinking</a></h4>

<p>What is hypothetical thinking? We do it continually. Consider making a decision, from choosing what to eat to choosing what to do about a dangerous disease. In deciding between options, you have to consider each of them, working out what’s likely to happen <em>if</em>  you take it, then compare the results. A natural human way to do that is by <em>imagining</em> taking the given option, and following through that scenario, still “offline” in imagination, but constrained by your background sense of reality. That sense includes innate or learned patterns of expectation about what will happen next, of how things and people in general tend to behave; it also includes your knowledge of your local environment and its particular inhabitants. It may be informed by modern science. Unfortunately, it may also be distorted by various sorts of prejudice and error. Still, we often have to rely on our ability to preview options hypothetically, because we cannot try them all before deciding. Choosing the right option first time can be a matter of life or death.</p><p>Hypothetical thinking is used for theoretical purposes as well as practical ones. For example, when a mathematician wants to prove that every number with a property P also has a property Q, the most straightforward way to do it is by <em>supposing</em> that an unspecified number <em>x</em> has P, then proving from that hypothesis that <em>x</em> also has Q. For that shows that <em>if</em> <em>x</em> has P, <em>then x</em> has Q. Since <em>x</em> could be any number with P, the argument establishes that <em>every</em> number with P also has Q.</p><p>We can get more precise about what such cases have in common. They all involve a procedure for assessing conditional statements of the form “If X, then Y.” For instance, “X” could be “It rains” and “Y” “The match will be cancelled”, or “X” could be “I try to swim across the river” and “Y” “I’ll reach the other side.” The procedure is this. First, suppose X. Then, on that hypothesis, assess Y, using whatever background information is appropriate. Finally, whatever attitude you take to Y on the hypothesis X, take the <em>same</em> attitude unconditionally to “If X, then Y.” Thus, if you <em>accept</em> the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is slow, you are a strong swimmer), you unconditionally <em>accept</em> the conditional statement “If I try to swim the river, I’ll reach the other side.” But if you <em>reject</em> the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is fast, you are a weak swimmer), you unconditionally <em>reject</em> the conditional statement. We may call that procedure the <em>Suppositional Rule</em>. Although its explicit articulation in words is quite abstract, we implicitly use it in practice all the time. It comes so naturally to us that it may seem almost trivial.</p><p>What we fail to realize, in unreflectively applying the Suppositional Rule, is that it contains a hidden logical inconsistency. That can be proved in several different ways; <em>Suppose and Tell</em> has the details. Thus it cannot be 100% reliable. But that does not mean that it is completely useless. It works well enough for practical purposes in most ordinary applications. When restricted to acceptance on the basis of mathematical proof, it works perfectly. But the unrestricted rule, which we use in everyday life, subtly generates contradictions in some cases.</p><p>The Suppositional Rule is what psychologists call a <em>heuristic</em>, a way of answering questions of some kind which is quick and easy to use, but only imperfectly reliable. For example, when we are asked which personal names in a list are the most common, with no access to statistics, we may use their psychological accessibility as a heuristic, a guide to their frequency. In vision, we may use discontinuities in colour as a guide to the edges of solid objects; camouflage exploits the limitations of that heuristic.</p><p>The inconsistency of our heuristic for conditionals helps explain why logicians have had so much trouble understanding the meaning of conditional statements in natural languages. It was already a matter of controversy amongst the ancient Greeks, more than two thousand years ago. The poet Callimachus wrote: “Even the crows on the rooftops are cawing about the question ‘Which conditionals are true?’” It is just as hotly contested today amongst philosophers and linguists. The trouble was that we didn’t realize just what rule we were applying, so its inconsistency was unclear. This affected even the data on which discussion relied, which largely consisted of sample sentences classified as “correct” or “incorrect”—using the inconsistent heuristic!</p><p>How can such a logically flawed heuristic serve us so well in practice? As with other paradoxes uncovered by philosophers, in practice we can get a long way by backing off whenever we bump into a paradox, without trying to understand what it is we have stumbled across.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@thanospal?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Thanos Pal</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/exploring-hypothetical-thinking/">Exploring hypothetical thinking</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/631888840/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/what-does-a-linguist-do/" rel="nofollow">What does a linguist do?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/harlequins-tricky-name/" rel="nofollow">Harlequin’s tricky name</a></li></ul> </div>

Jan van Deursen, together with his postdoc Bennett Childs, engaged a notorious German law firm against me. The former Mayo Clinic professor denies accusations of bullying and discrimination and obviously seeks to prevent his lab members from talking to the press. Hoecker Lawyers claim van Deursen resigned as pensioner on 24 July 2020, voluntarily.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FHwtiShXfjs/">Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></h4>

<p>The Black Lives Matter movement in the US and elsewhere has rightly brought about a much-needed reexamination of deeply rooted issues around diversity and equity for minorities and marginalized populations. Structural racism and other inequities, for example around gender or status, continue to affect academia world-wide. At PLOS we recognize that we can do better — our journals can and must play a role in addressing concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>



<p>These are not new concerns, and we have been working to make our journals a home for diverse voices. However, we recognize that we need to step up our efforts in a number of areas and commit to doing so. For our journals, this means:</p>



<ul><li>We will <strong>assess and survey the diversity of our contributors</strong>, from the thousands of Academic Editors handling submissions at our journals to our authors and reviewers. This will establish a baseline and allow us to hold ourselves accountable for making measurable positive changes. </li></ul>



<ul><li>We need to <strong>improve the diversity of our journals and their leadership</strong>. This includes our internal staff but also our Academic Editors appointed to senior roles. We need to ensure that our journals are representative of broader society as well as the academic community, and that the voices of different communities or groups of researchers are heard and play an integral role in our journals. We commit to proactively seeking out underrepresented communities to redress the balance.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We will continue our efforts to <strong>ensure that all manuscript handling processes are set up to recognize and minimize bias</strong>. We are reflecting internally on how we can improve our understanding of these issues and minimise any of our own biases, and will work with our Academic Editors and peer reviewers to address any form of bias against authors or their origin in the handling of submitted manuscripts. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Within the scope of each of our journals we <strong>aim to be a</strong> <strong>publishing platform for research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations</strong>. In doing so, we need to ensure that the study of these populations recognizes the problem of racism and inequalities, and that the topic is covered appropriately in published papers. We need to be mindful of inappropriate discussions of race in relationship with genetics traits for example. Inequalities and racism do affect the well-being of minority populations, and this needs to be considered in public health research settings as well.<br /></li><li>We have the obligation to continue to <strong>uphold the highest standards of ethics</strong>. Research about minorities or other affected populations needs to be conducted to the highest editorial standards and ethics guidelines, and should award credit to contributors from these communities as appropriate.  We will not publish research intended to directly support oppression or persecution. </li></ul>



<p>Some of these commitments are items that we will be able to address swiftly, whereas others will take more time to achieve. This topic will therefore be a regular feature on PLOS Blogs, so watch this space. We are committed to pursue these activities in the short as well as long term, and to facilitate change not just at PLOS’ journals, but also in the broader academic community where possible. We count on your support in this endeavor and will appreciate any feedback, help or suggestions for specific actions to take. Thank you!<br /></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/NF4WPlV1nKw/">Early Sharing: Should You Take the Plunge?</a></h4>

<h4>What does early sharing accomplish?</h4>



<p>Scientific discovery is a process of continuous vetting and refinement. While immediate access to the latest findings allows for accelerated discoveries, sharing early and transparently also results in more checkpoints throughout the research process for communities to provide feedback. The need for effective and time-sensitive global collaboration has been further emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting early sharing practices helps ensure your research is available as soon as it’s needed, regardless of your field. </p>



<p>Early sharing allows for the latest research to be connected without waiting for the final publication. Whether it’s through a preprint, open data set, or accessible protocol, researchers are empowered to cite the latest discoveries in their current research. Learning how and when researchers have adopted early sharing is the first step to contributing to this global movement. </p>



<h4>Sharing Before the Study Takes Place</h4>



<p>The research question being pursued and the resulting study design create the foundation of a research project. These core elements are often internally reviewed to ensure the resulting study is as sound and focused as possible, but the greater research community typically doesn’t see the methodology of a study until the results and conclusions are published. By preregistering your study protocol early, you enable broader research assessment to begin at the foundation of a study. The study design itself goes through peer review so that potential improvements or flaws are detected before the study actually takes place. When the final research article is ready to be assessed, editors can consider the study’s rigor and adherence to the study design.   </p>



<p>To help ensure a study follows the highest standards and has long-term reproducibility, <em>PLOS ONE</em> and <em>PLOS Biology</em> both offer <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">preregistration options</a>. Preregistration can help reduce confirmation bias of editors and reviewers by confirming the underlying validity of your research. Additionally, having your protocol published allows others to pursue your study, or to tweak your design to fit their available resources. </p>



<h4>Sharing Initial Findings</h4>



<p>Earlier this year, <em>PLOS Biology</em> announced two new <a href="https://biologue.plos.org/2020/04/14/new-linked-article-types-enable-researchers-to-publish-findings-as-their-work-progresses/">linked articles types</a>: Discovery Reports and Update Articles. To alleviate the pressure of having to wait for a fully formed story to develop, Discovery Articles give researchers the flexibility to publish novel initial findings and as a first step. Once the Discovery Report is published, both the original authors and other research groups can augment the initial report by submitting Update Articles for review. </p>



<p>As multiple Update Articles can be linked to a single Discovery Report, your initial finding can spring into a series of interconnected advancements. </p>



<h4>Sharing Before Publication</h4>



<p>Preprints provide a platform for open, public review that is independent from a journal and doesn’t depend on an invitation from the editor. While the original preprint can be viewed and cited prior to publication, the preprint can be updated as the manuscript is revised to ensure the most recent version of your paper is always available. </p>



<p>PLOS makes the interaction between preprint servers and our journals as simple as possible. You can directly submit your preprint to our journals from medRxiv and bioRxiv, or you can include the DOI of your preprint on the submission form if you used a different server. For those in other subjects, there is an ever-growing collection of active <a href="https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers">preprint servers</a>. Alternatively, authors of life science articles can opt-in to have the paper uploaded to bioRxiv during submission, without any additional work. Our editors are encouraged to consider comments left on a preprint, allowing for the open review platform that preprints provide to potentially accelerate and deepen the review process. </p>



<p>That said, open and accessible data sets are another opportunity to collaborate among far-spanning researchers. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/a-selfish-reason-to-share-research-data/">Recent research</a> has shown that publications that link to data in a repository are cited more frequently on average. As many researchers around the world don’t have access to the infrastructure required to generate their own data sets, making your data available without restrictions is an easy way to ensure your research is maximizing its contribution and usefulness. </p>



<p>Early sharing opens up opportunities throughout the research process to share study designs, initial findings, and data at a global scale. Involve your communities with early sharing practices so that vetting happens throughout the research process, ultimately improving the credibility of your final research output.</p>

Many of the same groups of individuals known to suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes are faring especially poorly during this pandemic. In many ways, the disparate outcomes being documented in COVID-19 are simply offering a magnified view of longstanding health inequities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html#:~:text=means%20is%20lacking.-,What%20is%20health%20equity%3F,be%20as%20healthy%20as%20possible.">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a> stated that “<em>Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy</em>“. To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed. Socially disadvantaged people, who have been historically marginalized and/or disfavored by social and political institutions, have faced significant obstacles to health equity in the midst of COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html">Social distancing</a>, a key recommendation for preventing the spread of COVID-19, has proven to be very difficult for socially disadvantaged persons. Housing insecurity and homelessness are established risk factors for chronic health conditions, including <a href="https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/4/241">kidney disease</a>. In the setting of COVID-19, these challenges have meant that many individuals cannot feasibly maintain the recommended physical distance from others. Further, for people in service professions that require they interact daily with the public, their ability to socially distance has also been quite challenged. Racial and ethnic minorities and low income persons are overrepresented in such professions, which has increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure.</p>
<p>For people who have sought testing for COVID-19, inequities in health care access and services have been on full display. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases?t=1595235018970">One report</a> noted that African Americans patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. cough and fever) were less likely to be given a COVID-19 test than were white persons with the same symptoms. This type of biased delivery of health services can lead to socially disadvantaged individuals presenting later (e.g. for hospitalization) with severe symptoms or even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/beloved-brooklyn-teacher-30-dies-coronavirus-denied-covid/story?id=70376445">death</a>.  As vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are developed and disseminated, individuals who have directly, or vicariously, experienced bias in the health care setting may be reticent to seek these options, out of fear of inequitable treatment.</p>
<p>COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to shortages of food in many communities due to store closures as well as bulk purchases by individuals who can afford to do so. Low-income communities have been particularly affected. A consequence of structural inequities including residential segregation, food access is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379708007290?via%3Dihub">known to vary</a> by community demographics. In this pandemic, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, may be exacerbated, particularly for persons facing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638616306722">food insecurity</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/04/07/game-plan-to-help-those-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-171863">Solutions</a> for addressing the inequities magnified by COVID-19 have been offered and include expanding access to testing and health care, and providing social services to keep vulnerable groups safe. People with kidney diseases are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556">death</a>. Because many are also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30899864/">socially disadvantaged</a>, it will be important to evaluate and expand the services they are provided, including those addressing social needs.</p>
