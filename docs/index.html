<p><strong>This plastic will self-destruct</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/plastic-will-self-destruct">Science News</a>,</em>&nbsp;August 7, 1971</p>



<p>Public indignation over litter and garbage has caused industry to ask chemists whether self-destroying, or quickly degradable, plastics might be devised to replace indestructible … glass, aluminum and plastics, which comprise the largest segment of consumer waste.… [Chemist James] Guillet and his team … devised a self-destroying plastic that is about ready for marketing — a wrapping paper that disintegrates in about a month.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Guillet’s work on polymers that degrade via light helped pave the way for their wider commercial use. But these materials may have created more problems than they solved. Most plastics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">wind up in landfills</a> where the materials don’t get enough light to degrade as intended (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>). Plastics that do break down turn into microscopic pieces that can wind up in ecosystems and harm animals. Scientists are trying to make more eco-friendly plastics, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-compost-new-enzyme-technique-biodegradable">compostable plastics</a> that can be totally broken down with enzymes (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">What science tells us about reducing coronavirus spread from wind instruments</a></h4>

              
                <p>The last time I played clarinet with my band was on March 10, 2020. It was a typical Tuesday evening rehearsal: About 10 musicians crowded into a small basement room, sipping beers and chatting between tunes. Brass instruments, woodwinds and drums blared, with bass lines audible from the stairwell.</p>



<p>Since 2004, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra has practiced in the same space, a couple of blocks from the East River in Brooklyn, N.Y. The room is cramped — chairs and music stands crowd every corner, shelves are crammed with instruments and sheet music. With no windows or AC units, air circulation is minimal.</p>



<p>When I walked up the stairs after practice, I had no idea that the space we’d filled with boisterous pop covers and protest tunes would sit quiet for more than a year. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in March 2020, isolating musicians like me from the art we love. Millions of high school and college musicians were barred from their band rooms, children’s lessons were canceled and professionals lost performance opportunities and income streams.</p>

<p>Though restrictions are now easing, we still face questions about how our instruments play into infection risk. Wind instruments — brasses as well as woodwinds like my clarinet — produce sound through human breath. And human breath spreads COVID-19. So how can we perform while keeping ourselves and our audiences safe, during the pandemic and beyond? To find answers, wind musicians, including myself, turned to science.</p>



<h4>An ill wind</h4>



<p>The hazards of live music hit home when <a href="https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-superspreader-singing.html">news broke</a> of a superspreader event among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington state. On March 10 — the same day as my band’s final rehearsal — 61 members had gathered to sing. By the time Gov. Jay Inslee instituted a stay-at-home order two weeks later, 52 members of the choir had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or were assumed to have it. Three singers were hospitalized, and two died.</p>



<p>The group had been careful, avoiding physical contact such as handshakes and hugs, putting plenty of space between their chairs and using hand sanitizer. At that time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health agencies were primarily telling people to avoid close contact and contaminated surfaces to reduce transmission risks. But many musicians quickly realized that something else was going on.</p>



<p>“When we saw the Skagit Valley choir spread, we knew right away that [the coronavirus] was spreading via aerosol,” says Mark Spede, director of bands at Clemson University in South Carolina. He is one of the lead researchers on a coalition that developed COVID-19 protocols for performing arts students. It was “pretty clear,” he says, that the virus was spreading through the air. On May 15, 2020, Skagit County health department staff reported in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm">the “act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission</a> through emission of aerosols.”</p>



<p>I quickly realized that wind instruments like mine had to pose a similar danger. To play it safe, most wind musicians stopped playing together. My band briefly entertained the idea of practicing outside, but as New York City shut down, we switched to virtual rehearsals. These meetings were a poor substitute for in-person sessions. As anyone who’s tried to sing “Happy Birthday” over Zoom can tell you, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-call-zoom-pandemic-popularity-phone-tech-history">videocalling platforms</a> just don’t cut it for music practice. These platforms are built to highlight one speaker at a time, creating a painful lag in sound when people try to sing or play simultaneously (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>“School band shut down,” recalls 16-year-old Hannah Scheuer, a bandmate of mine and a student in the New York City public school system. Unable to enter the school building for months, classmates who rented instruments from the school couldn’t bring them home to practice. A survey conducted in late April by Spede and colleagues revealed that out of 30,000 U.S. high school and college music programs, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">about one-third had no in-person rehearsals</a> through the end of the 2020–2021 school year.</p>

<h4>Musicians in studies</h4>



<p>Facing a lockdown without the camaraderie of rehearsals, musicians wanted answers about the risks their instruments might pose in spreading COVID-19. Some went as far as becoming study subjects to find out.</p>



<p>The Minneapolis-based Minnesota Orchestra, for instance, reached out to Jiarong Hong, a mechanical engineer at the nearby University of Minnesota. A <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/new-study-explores-how-coronavirus-travels-indoors">July 2020 release of his study on indoor transmission of the coronavirus</a> had drawn media attention; the study was later <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301476">published</a> in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>. Catching wind of this work, the orchestra asked Hong and colleagues to “provide scientifically driven guidelines to help them get back to their work safely,” Hong says. His lab set up experiments with the musicians, which led to one of the first studies on the subject.</p>



<p>Engineer Lia Becher at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar in Germany had an experience similar to Hong’s. When a colleague’s video demonstrating how air spreads after a cough went viral, musicians asked Becher and her lab group how air would spread out of their instruments. So she worked with local musicians to meticulously track the dispersion of air from instruments with mouthpieces.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Spede and James Weaver, director of performing arts and sports for the National Federation of State High School Associations in Indianapolis, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/articles/unprecedented-international-coalition-led-by-performing-arts-organizations-to-commission-covid-19-study/">convened a group of concerned music teachers and arts organizations</a>. They worked with mechanical engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Maryland in College Park to study the risks posed by different performance activities, in the hopes of bringing students back to classrooms for fall 2020.</p>



<p>These studies and others like them fall into two categories, notes Juliette O’Keeffe, an environmental health scientist at the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health in Vancouver. Some, she explains, visualize the air coming out of an instrument (a qualitative method), while others measure properties of the air particles that emerge, such as size, concentration and distance traveled (a quantitative method). O’Keeffe conducted a <a href="https://ncceh.ca/sites/default/files/COVID-19 Risks and precautions for the performing arts.pdf">review of studies that examined aerosols emitted from instruments</a> and she posted her findings on her institution’s website on September 23, 2020.</p>



<p>Becher and colleagues employed qualitative methods, visualizing the air with a special mirror called a schlieren mirror. Using the temperature and pressure differences between static air and exhaled air, the mirror turns air patterns into visual light patterns. Videos produced by Becher’s team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEJhHf-zpHE&amp;list=PL9DGkx-EA5-EiKNMBeVVwFzuukZHvpEmm&amp;index=2">show exactly how air comes out of different instruments</a>, in what looks like roiling puffs of smoke.</p>

</div><figcaption><br>When a musician blows into their instrument, air particles escape through the instrument and the musician’s mouth. In these three clips, a schlieren mirror visualizes, via temperature and pressure change, how particles escape a flute, a trumpet, and a bass clarinet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hong’s lab followed quantitative methods, <a href="https://tsi.com/products/particle-sizers/particle-size-spectrometers/aerodynamic-particle-sizer-(aps)-spectrometer-3321/">using an aerodynamic particle sizer</a> — a special spectrometer that measures the diameters of tiny particles. These instruments can determine the sizes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">aerosols that may spread the coronavirus</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spede and Weaver’s collaborators used both quantitative and qualitative methods. This included the schlieren mirror and measurements taken in a dedicated aerosol testing room with a ventilation system that allows engineers to isolate the aerosols that emerged from the various instruments.</p>



<h4>Which winds pose the highest risks?</h4>



<p>For singers, all air comes directly out of the windpipe. But for wind musicians, once the air leaves the windpipe, its travel pattern depends on the instrument.</p>



<p>Hong’s team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301555">measured these patterns with musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra</a>. The study’s findings, which he also published in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>, measured risk by comparing the size and concentration of air particles dispersed by musicians with those emitted when a person speaks. Tubas were lowest risk, producing fewer particles than a person speaking. Flutes, French horns and larger woodwinds released similar levels of aerosols as a speaking person. Oboes, trombones and especially trumpets were all higher risk, spreading more aerosols than a person speaking.</p>



<p>Hong’s research provides specific aerosol sizes and concentration measurements for individual instruments. But this work, like other studies in this field, used very small sample sizes of one or two musicians to characterize an instrument’s air dispersion.</p>

<p>Such a small sample size can be particularly challenging when investigating woodwinds. While brass instruments are easy to evaluate, because all air goes straight from the mouthpiece to the bell, woodwinds get complicated. When I play my clarinet, aerosols have several escape routes: the flared opening at the instrument’s end, the keyholes and the space where my lips meet the reed — the thin piece of wood that vibrates against the clarinet’s mouthpiece to create sound. What’s more, small differences between clarinet players’ techniques can have a big impact on the speeds and concentrations of aerosols that players release.</p>



<p>In one trial by Hong’s team, one clarinet player produced five times as many aerosols as a second clarinet player. Hong hypothesizes that this difference is because one player used a “harder” clarinet reed, typically used by more experienced musicians. This reed is stiffer and requires more air to produce a sound. The way a clarinet player positions her mouth around her instrument may also affect aerosol generation, Hong explains.</p>



<p>Like Hong’s research, Becher’s work and preliminary findings from Spede and Weaver’s studies suggest that trumpets, trombones, clarinets and oboes spread more aerosols farther out into performance spaces, while larger instruments, particularly tubas, pose lower risks. The long, circuitous tubes in larger instruments trap breath-propelled particles and reduce the speed of those that do escape — in other words, you’re less likely to catch COVID-19 if you stand in front of a tuba player than if you stick your head into a tuba’s bell.</p>



<p>Although more research is needed, current studies nonetheless suggest that in most cases playing a wind instrument is about as likely (or even less likely) to transmit the coronavirus as loud talking or singing. The air is just traveling through your instrument’s tubing, rather than going straight out of your mouth. And there are ways to reduce risk.</p>





<h4>Safety tips</h4>



<p>While Hong, Becher and other scientists researched particle dispersion from wind instruments, music nonetheless returned to the streets of New York in summer 2020, with many musicians inspired to support Black Lives Matter protests across the city. Eager to join the movement, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra began looking at studies, deliberating how to be safe. I and three other science-minded performers formed a COVID-19 committee.</p>



<p>Evaluating the literature was tricky. In an August 2020 e-mail exchange, committee member Phil Andrews sent the band a preprint from medRxiv.org, which <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165837v1?fbclid=IwAR3fRbIH_K1NbzThfPR2Eje4t4iA-kQPMr1O0ZAe_tbI2vH5LHwqK5i0L0A">suggested that fabric covers be stretched over brass instruments’ bells</a> — the flared openings through which sound emerges. I wrote back with caution, noting that the study included only eight participants. Everything seemed preliminary, and because many of our bandmates have health conditions or families to look after, we opted for more caution. Until we knew more, we’d play only percussion instruments — outside.</p>



<p>Other musicians I spoke with remembered scouring the CDC’s website for any mention of wind instruments and carefully reading preprints in subjects that they had never studied. Benjamin Yates, a trombone instructor at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, recalls an instance of intense research over the summer: “I was sitting at my computer and I had all these tabs open, and I’m looking up really basic terms, like ventilation — what does ventilation actually mean, scientifically?”</p>



<p>Yates’ and my efforts to align group practices with scientific recommendations reflected a broader trend across the nation to find safe ways to play music. While some musicians opted to stay in lockdown, others moved rehearsals and performances outside, often using makeshift bell covers or musician masks with space for a mouthpiece. A mask with a hole in it might seem odd, but research led by Spede and Weaver shows that these masks reduce aerosol spread from the sides of musicians’ mouths as they blow into their instruments. This is especially key for younger musicians who have less control over their mouth positioning.</p>



<p>Formulating safe strategies for musicians became especially important as U.S. school programs prepared for the 2020 fall semester. For Spede and Weaver, time was ticking on their project to build guidelines for student musicians. Preliminary investigations by engineers at the Universities of Colorado and Maryland provided the information they needed. This study, which included <a href="https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/hq37vp75r">12 performers playing nine different instruments</a>, was published as a preprint on the University of Colorado’s website in April 2021. Before publication, however, Spede and Weaver’s team used the findings to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u46GJAnpZ7k">devise detailed risk mitigation guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2020–2021 school year, Spede and Weaver <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">surveyed U.S. high school and college music programs</a>. Of 3,000 programs that responded, about 2,800 reported using some or all of the guidelines for bands, choirs or orchestras. Among those schools that responded, coronavirus spread was almost nonexistent. Eight programs each reported a case of coronavirus spread between musicians: five in choirs, two in bands and one in an orchestra. Seven of the eight cases involved one person infecting a single other person; two of the cases occurred at schools that did not use any of the recommended safety guidelines.</p>



<p>“With hundreds or thousands of hours of rehearsal and millions of people participating,” Weaver says, “the fact that we’ve had [so few] cases of spread, we’re pretty confident in the mitigations.” Spede and Weaver believe these protocols could be useful beyond the pandemic, for instance, during cold and flu seasons and other infectious disease outbreaks.</p>



<p>In addition to Spede and Weaver’s guidelines, musicians may consider reorganizing where they sit onstage. A modeling study by researchers at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, based on Hong’s measurements, suggests that moving percussion instruments toward the center of the stage and putting the highest-risk winds near vents that pull air from the room can cut aerosol accumulation. The Utah Symphony, which collaborated with the University of Utah researchers on this study, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-musicians-relocating-reduce-risk-concerts">adopted this recommendation</a> for its spring 2021 concert season (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>O’Keeffe also suggests that musicians monitor COVID-19 transmission rates in their communities, so they know the likelihood that a person with COVID-19 is present. Disease-tracking metrics used by the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I., indicate that more than <a href="https://globalepidemics.org/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression/">10 new cases a day for every 100,000 people</a> in a region constitutes higher risk. Musicians may feel safer, too, when more than 70 percent of their community is fully vaccinated, adopting the vaccination goal from the White House COVID-19 task force.</p>



<h4>An industry transformed</h4>



<p>When I asked musicians how COVID-19 changed their musical activity, their answers reflected both the economic and emotional fallout of last spring’s lockdowns.</p>



<p>“Before COVID, I was working at my [former] high school as a school aide while giving lessons there as well,” says Elijah Herring, a saxophone student who graduated from New York’s Brooklyn College this spring. “Because the school system closed down, I lost my job. I wasn’t able to get unemployment benefits until June or July.… I had to street perform to make ends meet, to pay bills, to take care of my mom.”</p>



<p>In the short term, COVID-19 was a blow to the music world. Musicians lost income as well as motivation to practice or compose; some left the industry altogether. But in the long term, the pandemic has transformed how many musicians think about their profession.</p>



<p>“Music is a privilege,” says Orion White, a saxophone student at the University of Idaho in Moscow. “It’s something that really sticks with you; it changes you. It can be almost religious if you let it be, and I took that for granted. Not anymore.”</p>



<p>This sentiment is heightened by the layers of added challenge needed to play — any performance, group practice or even informal jam session now requires intensive safety and trust. Before they can start playing, musicians must trust each other with their vaccination status and other health information. I’ve led discussions in my own band, developing practice guidelines that incorporate health needs and risk comfort levels.</p>

<p>Audiences seem to acknowledge the effort that goes into performing. Andrews and Herring both say that they’re getting more money from busking now than they did before the pandemic.</p>



<p>The Rude Mechanical Orchestra had our first pandemic practice that included wind instruments on May 18 this year. We gathered outside, by the river, a few blocks away from our old basement practice space.</p>



<p>We had agreed to strict guidelines — all wind players had to be fully vaccinated, with masks and bell covers on. So only four people opted to play a wind instrument. Still, a tuba, two trombones, a clarinet and a lot of percussion was enough to bring melodies to life. We played through some of our classic tunes, pausing to talk through song structure and enjoy the breeze.</p>



<p>At one point, a small girl with a loose ponytail approached us and began dancing to the music. She didn’t know that we were out of practice or that half of the drummers were trained in other instruments. But her dance echoed our joy in being back together.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">Squirrels use parkour tricks when leaping from branch to branch</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkour enthusiasts need look no further than up in the trees for inspiration. Squirrels’ aerial acrobatics make the rodents masters of the form, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A detailed look at how squirrels navigate narrow branches that bend and sway with the wind — where the smallest error could spell death — shows that the rodents make split-second calculations to balance trade-offs between branch bendiness and the distance between tree limbs. And for particularly tricky jumps, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe5753">squirrels improvise parkour-style moves</a> in midair to stick the landing, researchers report in the Aug. 6 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>This study is “a great example of how cool ‘normal’ animals can be in their biomechanics,” says Michelle Graham, a graduate student in biomechanics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved with the research. “We’ve all seen squirrels do crazy stuff in nature, but no one ever pays any attention to it.”</p>



<p>That is unless you’re like Nathaniel Hunt, who has been mesmerized by watching squirrels flash through the overstory since graduate school. “Tree canopies are incredibly challenging environments to navigate,” says Hunt, an integrative biologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha. When jumping between bendy branches, a squirrel must assess how far it has to jump and know when to leap. Jump too early and the squirrel will fall short. Too late, and the squirrel will find itself on a branch too flimsy from which to launch. Hunt wondered, “How are they sensitive to that trade-off, managing to make accurate leaps?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>To find out, he and his colleagues designed an artificial forest obstacle course on the outskirts of the University of California, Berkeley campus. Then, the team used peanuts to coax free-ranging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-name-66-species-potential-biodiversity-threats-eu">fox squirrels</a> (<em>Sciurus niger</em>) into running and jumping through a series of acrobatic tests (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>First, the unwitting subjects learned to leap from artificial branches of high, medium or low stiffness across a gap to reach a prize: a basket of peanuts at the end of a landing peg. High-speed video captured details of the jumps, from launch point to landing accuracy, for 12 squirrels spanning 96 leaping trials.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the squirrels leaped from more bendy branches earlier — presumably to maximize jumping force — even though that increased the distance that the animals must clear, Hunt says. By comparing what the squirrels actually did with statistical models that simulated optimal jumping decisions, the researchers found something interesting: Branch flexibility had about six times as great an influence on when squirrels decided to jump as did the length of the gap. If squirrels had cared more about distance, they’d have jumped from about the same spot on the rod, regardless of its give. “We were surprised to see squirrels weighing both of these things simultaneously, but in different amounts,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>The researchers upped the ante for five squirrels by increasing the flexibility of branches as well as gap distance. Initial leaps were less than graceful. No squirrels fell, but most landed clunkily at first, grasping the peg they leaped to with their front paws and swinging around to pull themselves up instead of landing neatly on all fours. But within five trials, “squirrels learned to compensate for their initial error,” Hunt says, which they did by modifying their initial velocity.</p>

</div><figcaption>To better understand how squirrels leap from tree branch to tree branch without falling, researchers trained free-roaming squirrels to jump through a series of tests in an artificial forest obstacle course. High-speed camera footage showed that these rodents can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps, and that squirrels consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If squirrels regularly encounter the same branches, such quick learning “might explain how they move so fluidly and rapidly” across particular branches, Hunt explains. The rodents might be such quick navigators, he says, because “they’ve already learned what they need to know about that branch.”</p>



<p>The squirrels surprised the researchers in other ways too. For longer jumps, or those that necessitated landing higher or lower than the starting point, many squirrels rotated midair, using their legs to “jump” off an adjacent vertical wall in a parkour-style maneuver. More often than not, squirrels employed parkour to slow down if they were coming in too hot to a landing. “It’s an additional point of control,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>For many arboreal animals, “jumping between limbs is such a common thing, and yet we so frequently only study it in pieces,” Graham says, such as looking just at the launch but not the landing. This study&#8217;s holistic look reveals “something really interesting about squirrels, that they take greater account of [branch bendiness] than the gap distance,” she notes. “I don’t know that I would’ve guessed that.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The world is full of fascinating opportunities to learn. But with so many different topics for children to explore, why do they pick certain paths? In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621994230">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science, </em>a team from Rutgers University looks closely at what drives children’s curiosity. They find that children are motivated to learn more about a topic when there is a gap in their knowledge that they want to fill. The results suggest that for young children there is a sweet spot for learning, when they already know enough to find a topic interesting, but not so much that it becomes boring.</p>



<span id="more-43143"></span>



<p>In the first study, fifty children aged around five years old were assessed on their existing knowledge in three areas: biological transmission of illness, psychosomatic events, and theory of mind (understanding other people’s mental states). In the biological transmission domain, for example, children heard stories about a character who sneezed, and were asked whether a friend would also catch the illness, while in the psychosomatic domain they were asked if somebody’s cheeks could redden from embarrassment.</p>



<p>Next, participants were presented with choose your own adventure stories, where a character experienced a similar event to the one given in the knowledge assessment task and one that was irrelevant and unrelated. Participants then selected which event they wanted to hear the end of. In the biological transmission scenario, for example, participants read that a character had played with a friend with a cold. At the end of the story, the children were asked if they wanted to find out whether the character had picked up the cold or, instead, what he had for breakfast.</p>



<p>Based on their responses to the initial questions, children were classified as having either “mature” or “immature” levels of knowledge for each of the three areas. The team found that those with more knowledge showed no particular preference for either scenario when reading the story, but those with <em>immature</em> theories were more likely to select the ending that was related to the first part of the study.</p>



<p>This could be because the ending related to the first set of scenarios offered the children a chance to learn something new after their interest was initially piqued, the team suggests. Those who had a more mature understanding of the initial scenarios may have already known &#8220;too much&#8221; about them to find them particularly compelling, or were already certain enough about their knowledge to not feel the need to explore further.</p>



<p>The results were replicated in a second study, in which just 58% of children with mature theories chose the story ending related to the first part of the study, compared to 68% of those with immature theories (though the difference here was not significant). Interestingly, children who were in neither category, and instead were in an in-between group, transitioning from immature to mature theories, were far more likely to choose this option: 80% of children in this group selected the ending more closely related to the initial scenarios.</p>



<p>The results suggest that children use uncertainty when deciding what to learn about, the team says. When children are uncertain about things, they seek more information to resolve that uncertainty. This in turn informs their learning (and may go some way to explain why children often ask endless “Why?” questions).</p>



<p>The findings could help parents and teachers encourage children to learn more about particular topics, providing them with more information when they are at an intermediate stage of curiosity. Looking out for this particular knowledge gap, when interest is piqued, could be the starting point for further learning.</p>

                <p>At every moment, subatomic particles stream in unfathomable numbers through your body. Each second, about 100 billion neutrinos from the sun pass through your thumbnail, and you’re bathed in a rain of muons, birthed in Earth’s atmosphere. Even humble bananas emit positrons, the electron’s antimatter counterpart. A whole universe of particles exists, and we are mostly oblivious, largely because these particles are invisible.</p>

<p>When I first learned, as a teenager, that this untold world of particles existed, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And when I thought about it, I could barely breathe. I was, to steal a metaphor from writer David Foster Wallace, a fish who has only just noticed she’s swimming in water. The revelation that we’re stewing in a particle soup is why I went on to study physics, and eventually, to write about it.</p>



<p>To truly fathom matter at its most fundamental level, people must be able to visualize this hidden world. That’s where particle detectors come in. They spot traces of the universe’s most minuscule constituents, making these intangible concepts real. What’s more, particle detectors reveal beauty: Particles leave behind graceful spirals of bubbles, flashes of light and crisp lines of sparks.</p>

<p>As a physics student, I spent hours examining these stunning pictures in my textbooks. I went on to build particle detectors in graduate school, and to make my own images of particles wending their way through our world.</p>



<p>As a particle moves through a material, it drops bread crumbs that can give away its path. Those bread crumbs come in a variety of forms: light, heat or electric charge. “Basically, every particle detector that exists is looking for one or more of those three things,” says particle physicist Jennifer Raaf of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. Particle detectors translate the bread crumbs into signals that can be recorded and analyzed. Such signals helped reveal the physics of the standard model, a crowning achievement of science that describes the particles and forces of nature. They’re also likely to be key in the discovery of physics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">beyond the standard model</a>.</p>





<p>As time has passed, technologies for detecting particles have vastly improved. Here are a few types of detectors that have made the invisible visible.</p>





<h4>Through a cloud</h4>



<p>One of the first ways scientists visualized particle tracks was with cloud chambers. Developed more than a century ago, cloud chambers are filled with a gas — often a vapor of alcohol — on the verge of condensing into liquid. When a charged particle passes through the chamber, it strips electrons from the air within, creating an electric charge that initiates condensation. A wispy line forms along the particle’s path, like a miniature contrail.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg" alt="black and white image of positron particle track" class="wp-image-3101228" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg 456w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-388x383.jpg 388w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-188x186.jpg 188w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-588x580.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101228">A particle track in a cloud chamber in the early 1930s was the first evidence of a positron, a positively charged particle with the mass of an electron.&nbsp;The track is curved due to a magnetic field that surrounded the chamber.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101228">C. D. Anderson, courtesy of Emilio Segrè Visual Archives</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Scientists often surround cloud chambers and other detectors with a strong magnetic field, which bends particles’ paths into curves or spirals. Negatively charged particles curve in one direction, positive particles go the opposite way. Other details further characterize the particle: The amount of curvature indicates a particle’s momentum, for example.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers revealed a variety of previously unknown particles, including the positron and the muon, a heavy cousin of the electron, in the 1930s. These particles were mostly unexpected. At the time, physicists were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">barely coming to grips</a> with the fact that particles besides electrons and protons existed.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers are simple enough that you can <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber">make one in your own home</a>, using alcohol and dry ice.</p>

<h4>Bubble trails</h4>



<p>The 1950s were all about bubble chambers.</p>



<p>When charged particles pass through liquid in a bubble chamber, they leave tiny vapor bubbles, like iridescent orbs trailing a soap bubble wand. Although the chambers are typically filled with liquid hydrogen, a variety of liquids can be used; one early prototype even used beer. Bubble chambers could be made bigger than cloud chambers, and produced sharper tracks, making it possible to observe more particles in more detail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg" alt="black and white image of a kaon particle track" class="wp-image-3101220" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101220">A subatomic particle called a kaon decays into other particles that leave distinct spirals in this bubble chamber image from the 1970s.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101220">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the same decade, particle accelerators came to the fore. These accelerators produce energetic beams of particles that scientists can crash into other particles or into targets. Those collisions whip up a flurry of new particles. Scientists sent those beams into bubble chambers to watch what happened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg" alt="black and white image of the Big European Bubble Chamber" class="wp-image-3101219" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101219">The Big European Bubble Chamber, pictured during installation of the vessel, started up at CERN near Geneva in 1973.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101219">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The resulting images were not only scientifically illuminating, they were stunning: If Raaf were going to get a tattoo, she says, it might be a bubble chamber image. I’ve so far resisted the temptation to get ink.</p>



<h4>Going digital</h4>



<p>Cloud chambers and bubble chambers had a drawback. Tracks were typically recorded with photographs, and each had to be inspected by eye for anything of interest. That process was too slow; it held physicists back from discovering the particles that might show up in only one or two out of myriad photographs, if that. To find the rarest of particles, “you can’t really be looking at pictures. You want to have that information digitized in a smart way,” says Sam Zeller, a particle physicist at Fermilab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_multiwire-proportional_tracks.jpg" alt="image of tracks of new particles produced after a proton and antiproton collide" class="wp-image-3101223" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_multiwire-proportional_tracks.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_multiwire-proportional_tracks-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_multiwire-proportional_tracks-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_multiwire-proportional_tracks-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101223">In the UA1 detector at CERN near Geneva, high-voltage wires recorded the electric charge produced when incoming particles dislodged electrons from atoms in a gas-filled chamber.

Kalmus, UA1 Experiment/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enter the multiwire proportional chamber. Invented in 1968, this technology relies on a fine array of high-voltage wires, which record charge produced when incoming particles dislodge electrons from atoms in a gas-filled chamber. This technique could capture millions of particle tracks per second, much more than bubble chambers could achieve. And the data went directly to a computer for analysis. Multiwire proportional chambers and their descendants revolutionized particle physics, and led to discoveries of particles such as the charm quark and the gluon in the 1970s, and the W and&nbsp;Z bosons in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Some of the most advanced modern detectors trace their lineage back to multiwire proportional chambers, such as liquid argon time projection chambers. These detectors are high-resolution, meaning that researchers can zoom in on the details of an interaction and visualize it in 3-D. Liquid argon time projection chambers will be key to one of the biggest upcoming particle physics experiments in the United States, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in South Dakota. Because neutrinos very rarely interact with matter, the experiment demands such advanced detection techniques.</p>



<h4>Shining a light</h4>



<p>Scientists have also devised methods to detect particles via light. When a particle moves above a certain speed limit for a given material, it emits light, known as Cherenkov light. It’s analogous to an airplane passing the sound-speed barrier and creating a sonic boom. Charged particles can also emit light when passing through materials laced with certain chemicals, called scintillators.</p>

<p>To spot the small amounts of light left behind by individual particles, scientists use photomultiplier tubes, originally invented in the 1930s, which convert light into electrical signals. These tubes could be used to pick up either Cherenkov light or scintillator light.</p>



<p>Scintillator detectors began to prove their worth in 1956 when a tank of liquid scintillator was used to discover the neutrino — once thought to be entirely undetectable. Liquid scintillator detectors are still common — used in the NOvA neutrino experiment at Fermilab, for example — as are detectors made of solid plastic strips with scintillator mixed in.</p>

<h4>Putting it all together</h4>



<p>Modern detectors at the world’s major particle colliders, like the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, throw in a bit of everything. “It’s this onion of different types of detectors; every layer is a different thing,” Raaf says. </p>

<p>Standing multiple stories tall, these massive machines include an assortment of technologies — plastic scintillator detectors, Cherenkov detectors, descendants of multiwire proportional chambers. They also typically include detectors made from silicon that can precisely measure particle tracks based on small electric currents produced when particle pass through. These detectors all work in concert within a very strong magnet. After particles collide at the center of the detector, computers crunch the data from all the parts and reconstruct what happened in the collision, tracing out the paths the particles took.</p>



<p>No matter the technique, the mesmerizing subatomic hieroglyphs allow physicists to decipher the native language of matter, unveiling its constituents and the forces by which they communicate. “It’s pretty amazing that you can see the invisible,” says Zeller.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-lunar-magnetic-field-short-time-space">A lunar magnetic field may have lasted for only a short time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A lunar magnetic field may not have just been short-lived; it may have persisted for only a blip in geologic time, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Shortly after the moon formed about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-still-old">4.5 billion years ago</a>, it may have begun generating a magnetic field, a protective sheath that can deflect away charged particles from the sun (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>). Now, analyses of moon rocks suggest that any lunar magnetic field was gone by <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7647">at least 4 billion years</a> ago, researchers report August 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetized lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts decades ago were the first indication that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-moon-got-its-magnetism">the moon may have once had an internal dynamo</a>, in which molten, iron-rich rock swirls inside the core of a celestial body, giving rise to a magnetic field (<em>SN: 11/9/11</em>). But how long such a lunar dynamo may have lasted has been unclear.</p>



<p>The moon’s core is “really small,” says John Tarduno, a geophysicist at the University of Rochester in New York, and it’s not clear how that core could have sustained a dynamo for long before cooling.</p>





<p>In the new study, Tarduno and colleagues examined the magnetization of a handful of Apollo rock samples. Analyzing the magnetism of tiny shards of metal trapped in crystals in rock dating to 3.9 billion, 3.6 billion, 3.3 billion and 3.2 billion years ago showed that those rocks were barely magnetized at all.</p>



<p>But the analyses also found that a piece of lunar glass formed during a meteorite impact about 2 million years ago “had a strong magnetic field — just a little weaker than Earth’s today,” Tarduno says. That’s odd, because “everyone agrees there isn’t a magnetic field on the moon now, and there wasn’t one 2 million years ago,” he says. “How does this happen?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="516" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png" alt="piece of impact glass" class="wp-image-3102247" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-505x383.png 505w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-593x450.png 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-245x186.png 245w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102247">Researchers found strong magnetization in a bit of impact glass (similar to the glass shown) that formed during the collision of a meteorite with the lunar surface just 2 million years ago. That magnetization, the team suggests, came not from a magnetic field generated by the moon’s core, but from the force of the meteorite impact.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102247">Rory Cottrell</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taken together, these findings point to one conclusion, the team says: that the moon hasn’t generated a magnetic field for at least 4 billion years. The magnetization of the bit of glass happened due to the meteorite impact that also formed the glass itself, Tarduno and colleagues suggest.</p>



<p>That idea — that a meteorite impact can produce strong magnetization in rocks — is one that’s been discussed in many scientific studies in the past, Tarduno says. As the meteorite punches into the lunar surface at superfast speeds, that impact can partially ionize particles on the surface, creating a thick magnetized plasma. “The glass, as it was moving through this plasma, acquired that strong magnetization,” he says.</p>



<p>The moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-map-lunar-surface-geology">has been repeatedly battered by meteorites</a> over time (<em>SN: 4/24/20</em>). And that means that other relatively young and highly magnetized lunar samples that researchers have puzzled over may have gotten their magnetization in this way, Tarduno says. If so, that may also help explain results from recent studies, based on analyses of the magnetization of a moon rock dating to between 2.5 billion and 1 billion years ago, that have suggested the moon’s magnetic field might have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-had-magnetic-field-least-billion-years-longer-thought">lingered until as recently as 1 billion years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>





<p>Geodynamicists have wrangled over how the moon’s small core could have sustained a magnetic field for billions of years or even if the moon ever had a magnetic field at all, says Lisa Tauxe, a paleomagnetist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. Modeling studies of the moon’s core “just have a great deal of trouble generating enough oomph to make a magnetic field, whereas you can do that pretty easily for the Earth.” The new study, she says, “presents a well-argued case against a long-lived field.”</p>



<p>If any lunar magnetic field did disappear about 4 billion years ago, the lengthy bombardment of the moon&#8217;s surface by the solar wind since then may have left a hidden wealth of helium-3 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-showers-dig-water-moon-nasa">water</a> buried in the lunar soils (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). Those are products that future moon expeditions may be able to mine for energy as well as life support.</p>



<p>Drilling into those soils may also give scientists an unprecedented glimpse at the past physical properties of the sun, which could also help scientists better understand conditions on the early Earth, Tarduno says. “[We] have the potential now to learn both about the ancient sun and early Earth’s atmosphere, which you’re not going to get in any other way,” he adds. “That’s really exciting stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">A bounty of potential gravitational wave events hints at exciting possibilities</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new crew of potential ripples in spacetime has just debuted — emphasis on the word “potential.”</p>



<p>By loosening the criteria for what qualifies as evidence for gravitational waves, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01045">physicists identified 1,201 possible tremors</a>. Most are probably fakes, spurious jitters in the data that can mimic the cosmic vibrations, the team reports August 2 at arXiv.org. But by allowing in more false alarms, the new tally may also include some weak but genuine signals that would otherwise be missed, potentially revealing exciting new information about the sources of gravitational waves.</p>



<p>Scientists can now look for signs that may corroborate some of the uncertain detections, such as flashes of light in the sky that flared from the cosmic smashups that set off the ripples. Gravitational waves are typically spawned by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">collisions of dense, massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars</a>, the remnants of dead stars (<em>SN: 1/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>To come up with the new census, physicists reanalyzed six months of data from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, and Virgo gravitational wave observatories. Scientists had already identified 39 of the events as likely gravitational waves in earlier analyses.</p>



<p>Eight events that hadn’t been previously identified stand a solid chance of being legitimate — with greater than a 50 percent probability of coming from an actual collision.</p>



<p>The physicists analyzed the data from those eight events to see how they might have occurred. In one, two black holes may have slammed together, melding into a whopper black hole with about 180 times the mass of the sun, which would make it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">the biggest black hole merger seen yet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). Another event could be a rare sighting of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">black hole swallowing a neutron star</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">Snake-eating spiders are surprisingly common</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spider’s typical dinner menu might include insects, worms or even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">small lizards</a> and frogs (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). But some arachnids have more adventurous tastes — they can eat snakes up to 30 times their size.</p>



<p>Take the Australian redback. Not including legs, a female of this species of spider is only about the size of an M&amp;M candy. But she can take down relatively big prey such as juvenile eastern brown snakes, which are among the most venomous serpents in the world. A snake that gets trapped in a redback’s web — a messy tangle of long, sticky silk threads that dangle to the ground — is quickly set upon by the spider, which subdues the struggling victim with more sticky silk before delivering a toxic bite that eventually kills the snake.</p>



<p>“I find it cool that tiny Australian redback spiders can kill brown snakes,” says spider biologist Martin Nyffeler of the University of Basel in Switzerland. “[It’s] very fascinating and a little frightening!”</p>



<p>But redbacks are far from the only spiders with an appetite for snake. <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-49/issue-1/JoA-S-20-050/Spiders-Arachnida-Araneae-feeding-on-snakes-Reptilia-Squamata/10.1636/JoA-S-20-050.full">At least 11 different families of spiders feed on snakes,</a> Nyffeler and herpetologist Whit Gibbons report May 11 in <em>The Journal of Arachnology.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="475" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg" alt="Brown widow spider crawls along a scarlet snake ensnared in the spider's web" class="wp-image-3102098" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-548x383.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-644x450.jpg 644w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-266x186.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102098">In Georgia, this brown widow spider (<em>Latrodectus</em> <em>geometricus</em>) snared a scarlet snake (<em>Cemophora coccinea</em>).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102098">Daniel R. Crook</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Nyffeler and Gibbons, of the University of Georgia in Athens, searched for reports of snake-eating spiders in all sorts of places — from research journals and magazine articles to social media and YouTube videos. In all, the team analyzed 319 accounts from all over the world. Most reports came from Australia and the United States, but these spiders live on every continent except Antarctica.</p>



<p>“I didn’t realize how common this was. I don’t think anybody did,” says evolutionary biologist Mercedes Burns of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who was not involved in the research.<br><br>Snakes that the spiders ate came from seven families. Some, including coral snakes, rattlers, palm-pitvipers and lanceheads, are highly venomous. “I was kind of surprised at the types of snakes that were described because some of them are pretty big, pretty strong,” Burns says.</p>





<p>Tangle web spiders, a group that includes North American widow spiders and redbacks, are the most successful snake slayers, Nyffeler and Gibbons found. Relatively small, these spiders can catch snakes 10 to 30 times their size, Nyffeler says.</p>



<p>Tidier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-poisonous-webs-neuro-toxins-genes">orb weaver spiders</a> don’t do too shabbily either (<em>SN: 8/3/20</em>). A golden silk orb weaver in Florida caught a 1-meter-long green snake, the longest in the study. However, making a meal of green snakes may be a risky choice — these serpents often eat arachnids, including orb weaver spiders, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Not all snake-eating spiders trap the serpents with webs. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-tarantula-eating-weird-stuff-complex-amazon-food-webs">Tarantulas actively hunt their prey</a>, then use powerful jaws to deliver a potent venom (<em>SN: 2/28/19</em>). “Often a tarantula tries to catch the snake by the head and will hold on in spite of all efforts of the snake to shake him off,” Nyffeler says. Once that venom takes effect, the snake calms down.</p>



<p>In some encounters, venom defeated snakes in minutes. In others, spiders took days to kill their prey, Nyffeler and Gibbons found.</p>

<p>Once the snakes die, spiders use enzymes to turn soft body parts into a soup that the arachnids suck into their stomach. “They have what’s called a pumping stomach,” Burns says. “It’s almost like their stomach is attached to a rubbery straw. They have to kind of suck everything down.”</p>



<p>Most of spiders in the study likely dine on snake only now and again, Nyffeler says. Some South American tarantulas, however, eat snakes and frogs almost exclusively.</p>



<p>Nyffeler hopes that his new study increases appreciation for spiders, which he calls extraordinary creatures. “The fact that small spiders are capable of killing much larger snakes is very fascinating,” he says. “Knowing and understanding this enriches our understanding of how nature works.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/04/around-the-world-people-co-operate-more-willingly-with-others-from-their-own-country/">Around The World, People Co-operate More Willingly With Others From Their Own Country</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Many of the world’s most pressing problems require global co-operation. If we are to combat climate change or contain the spread of devastating diseases, for instance, we need to work across borders and share resources.</p>



<p>So a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24787-1">new study</a> in <em>Nature Communications </em>doesn’t make for encouraging reading. Using a common paradigm for studying co-operation, Angelo Romano from the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and colleagues look at how more than 18,000 participants from 42 different countries co-operate with people from their own nation and elsewhere. They find that in every single country, participants show national parochialism: they co-operate more readily with people from their own country than with others.</p>



<span id="more-43134"></span>



<p>Participants completed 12 trials of a prisoner’s dilemma task, each with a different partner who either came from their own country or another country (there were also some trials in which participants weren’t given any information about their partner’s nationality). In each trial, participants were given 10 “monetary units”, and had to decide how many to keep for themselves and how many to give to their partner. Any money they gave away was doubled — and any they received from their partner were doubled too — so in theory the optimal result would be for both parties to co-operate by giving away all of their money. Additionally, on some trials participants were told their decisions would be private, while on others they were told they would be published online.</p>



<p>The team found that people co-operated more (i.e. sent more money to their partner) when their partner came from the same country compared to when they came from a different country. This effect was statistically significant for 39 of the 42 countries, and the remaining three showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. It also didn’t matter whether or not their decisions were going to be made public: participants displayed this “national parochialism” either way. And although the decisions were all about a hypothetical pool of money, a sub-study in which participants actually received a monetary reward produced the same results.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the extent to which participants favoured co-operating with their compatriots over people from other nations was similar across the different countries, and the team didn’t find any evidence that this was related to cultural or political factors. By contrast, they did find that <em>overall</em> levels of co-operation varied by country and were related to particular factors. For instance, co-operation was generally greater in countries with more egalitarian values and those where there are more opportunities to establish new relationships with others.</p>



<p>The results suggest that national parochialism occurs around the world with surprisingly little variation. This is consistent with theories that our tendency to favour the in-group is a universal human behaviour, the authors write. However, they also note that past studies using different methodologies<em> have </em>found cultural differences in in-group favouritism, so further work is needed to understand the exact scenarios in which national parochialism emerges in different countries.</p>



<p>Still, the study shows that at least when it comes to making decisions about sharing goods with others, people are less keen to co-operate with those outside of their own country. While the paper focuses on decisions made at an individual level rather than those made by governments and institutions, the work has clear implications when it comes to understanding the obstacles to co-operating across borders. In fact, we’re in the middle of a pandemic that requires a co-ordinated, global response, yet in most low-income countries <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02109-1">the vast majority of people haven’t received a single dose</a>. The barriers to global co-operation are obviously multi-faceted, but national parochialism surely doesn’t help.  </p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781643135748">How the Mountains Grew</a><br><em>John Dvorak</em><br><em>Pegasus Books, $29.95</em></p>



<p>Imagine a world where pigeon-sized dragonflies soar above spiders with half-meter-long legs, where 2-meter-long millipedes slither and 20-kilogram scorpions hunt. About 300 million years ago, such surreal creatures thrived; today, rocks hint at how these and other creatures in the deep past lived. These clues allow geologist and writer John Dvorak to vividly re-create ancient landscapes in <em>How the Mountains Grew: A New Geological History of North America</em>.</p>



<p>Far from a dusty tome plodding through plate tectonics, the book teems with life as Dvorak establishes inextricable links between geology and biology. Take the oversize dragonflies and millipedes now preserved as fossils. Rocks of a similar age hold evidence of a rise in atmospheric oxygen that helps explain how these animals grew so large.</p>





<p>The book zigzags from place to place on a chronological, continental-scale field trip. To avoid dizzying readers, Dvorak revisits certain sites that preserve multiple threads of geologic history. For instance, at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota’s Black Hills, he describes how, about 2 billion years ago, molten rock rose and lodged itself into sedimentary rocks deposited on the seafloor of bygone oceans. Today, presidents’ faces stare out from this now-solidified magma, those ancient oceanic sediments sitting just below the visage of George Washington. The book later returns to glimpse younger seas that came and went, depositing sediments now replete with fossils. All these rocks, Dvorak explains, whisper stories of how this particular mountain grew.</p>





<p>Dvorak also ponders Earth’s future, envisioning an ice sheet grinding down Mount Rushmore’s carefully carved profiles more than 100,000 years from now. And he considers humankind’s future, arguing that we must determine how our dependence on fossil fuels — the result of another interplay between biology and geology — will end.</p>



<p>But it’s a different end, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">the asteroid impact that marked the demise of the nonbird dinosaurs</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/20</em>), where Dvorak’s storytelling shines brightest. He imagines the final days of the last <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, describing its desperate search for food somewhere well north of Mount Rushmore. In the hours to months after the impact, we share this behemoth’s last steps, its final gasps.</p>



<p>“No degree of evolutionary perfection could have guaranteed survival,” Dvorak writes. As that lone <em>T. re</em>x dies on the page, we can’t help but realize that we, too, are brief biological moments in geologic time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-magnetic-field-hair-computer-simulations-physics">Black holes born with magnetic fields quickly shed them</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a shaggy dog in springtime, some black holes have to shed. New computer simulations reveal how black holes might discard their magnetic fields.</p>



<p>Unlike dogs with their varied fur coats, isolated black holes are mostly identical. They are characterized by only their mass, spin and electric charge. According to a rule known as the no-hair theorem, any other distinguishing characteristics, or “hair,” are quickly cast off. That includes magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The rule applies to black holes in a vacuum, where magnetic fields can simply slip away. But, says astrophysicist Ashley Bransgrove of Columbia University, “what we were thinking about is what happens in a more realistic scenario.” A magnetized black hole would typically be surrounded by electrically charged matter called plasma, and scientists didn’t know how — or even if — such black holes would undergo hair loss.</p>



<p>Black holes can be born with magnetic fields or gain them later, for example by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">swallowing a neutron star</a>, a highly magnetic dead star (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>). When Bransgrove and colleagues simulated the plasma surrounding a magnetized black hole, they found that a process called magnetic reconnection allows the magnetic field to escape the black hole. The magnetic field lines that map out the field’s direction break apart and reconnect. Loops of magnetic field form around blobs of plasma, some of which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.055101">blast outward</a>, while others fall into the black hole. That process eliminates the black hole’s magnetic field, the researchers report in the July 30 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetic reconnection in balding black holes could spew X-rays that astronomers could detect. So scientists may one day glimpse a black hole losing its hair.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greece-santorini-volcano-eruption-sea-level">Greece’s Santorini volcano erupts more often when sea level drops</a></h4>

              
                <p>When sea level drops far below the present-day level, the island volcano Santorini in Greece gets ready to rumble.</p>



<p>A comparison of the activity of the volcano, which is now partially collapsed, with sea levels over the last 360,000 years reveals that when the sea level dips more than 40 meters below the present-day level, it triggers a fit of eruptions. During times of higher sea level, <a href="https://press.springernature.com/eruptive-activity-of-the-santorini-volcano-controlled-by-sea-lev/19318268">the volcano is quiet</a>, researchers report online August 2 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>Other volcanoes around the globe are probably similarly influenced by sea levels, the researchers say. Most of the world’s volcanic systems are in or near oceans.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to see why a coastal or island volcano would not be affected by sea level,” says Iain Stewart, a geoscientist at the Royal Scientific Society of Jordan in Amman, who was not involved in the work. Accounting for these effects could make volcano hazard forecasting more accurate.</p>





<p>Santorini consists of a ring of islands surrounding the central tip of a volcano poking out of the Aegean Sea. The entire volcano used to be above water, but a violent eruption around 1600 B.C. caused the volcano to cave in partially, forming a lagoon. That <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-volcanoes-wake-fast">particular eruption</a> is famous for potentially dooming the Minoan civilization and inspiring the legend of the lost city of Atlantis (<em>SN: 2/1/12</em>).</p>



<p>To investigate how sea level might influence the volcano, researchers created a computer simulation of Santorini’s magma chamber, which sits about four kilometers beneath the surface of the volcano. In the simulation, when the sea level dropped at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust above the magma chamber splintered. “That gives an opportunity for the magma that’s stored under the volcano to move up through these fractures and make its way to the surface,” says study coauthor Christopher Satow, a physical geographer at Oxford Brookes University in England.</p>



<p>According to the simulation, it should take about 13,000 years for those cracks to reach the surface and awaken the volcano. After the water rises again, it should take about 11,000 years for the cracks to close and eruptions to stop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073021_mt_santorini_inline_680.gif" alt="animation of sea level rise, cracking crust and a volcanic eruption" class="wp-image-3102078" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102078">When the sea drops at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust beneath the Santorini volcano (illustrated) starts to crack. As the sea level drops even further over thousands of years, those cracks spread to the surface, bringing up magma that feeds volcanic eruptions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102078">Oxford Brookes University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It may seem counterintuitive that lowering the amount of water atop the magma chamber would cause the crust to splinter. Satow compares the scenario to wrapping your hands around an inflated balloon, where the rubber is Earth’s crust and your hands’ inward pressure is the weight of the ocean. As someone else pumps air into the balloon — like magma building up under Earth’s crust — the pressure of your hands helps prevent the balloon from popping. “As soon as you start to release the pressure with your hands, [like] taking the sea level down, the balloon starts to expand,” Satow says, and ultimately the balloon breaks.</p>



<p>Satow’s team tested the predictions of the simulation by comparing the Santorini volcano’s eruption history — preserved in the rock layers of the islands surrounding the central volcano tip — with evidence of past sea levels from marine sediments. All but three of the volcano’s 211 well-dated eruptions in the last 360,000 years happened during periods of low sea level, as the simulation predicted. Such periods of low sea level occurred when more of Earth’s water was locked up in glaciers during ice ages.</p>



<p>“It’s really intriguing and interesting, and perhaps not surprising, given that other studies have shown that volcanoes are sensitive to changes in their stress state,” says Emilie Hooft, a geophysicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, who wasn’t involved in the work. Volcanoes in Iceland, for instance, have shown an uptick in eruptions after overlying glaciers have melted, relieving the volcanic systems of the weight of the ice.</p>



<p>Volcanoes around the world are likely subject to the effects of sea level, Satow says, though how much probably varies. “Some will be very sensitive to sea level changes, and for others there will be almost no impact at all.” These effects will depend on the depth of the magma chambers feeding into each volcano and the properties of the surrounding crust.</p>



<p>But if sea level controls the activity of any volcano in or near the ocean, at least to an extent, “you’d expect all these volcanoes to be in sync with one another,” Satow says, “which would be incredible.”</p>



<p>As for Santorini, given that the last time sea level was 40 meters below the present-day level was about 11,000 years ago — and sea level is continuing to rise due to climate change — Satow’s team expects the volcano to enter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greek-volcano-reawakens">a period of relative quiet</a> right about now (<em>SN: 3/14/12</em>). But two major eruptions in the volcano’s history did happen amid high sea levels, the researchers say, so future violent eruptions aren’t completely off the table.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-baby-florida-historic-nursery-endangered">A hammerhead shark baby boom near Florida hints at a historic nursery</a></h4>

              
                <p>It seems like an unlikely place for a nursery of endangered hammerhead sharks, but a recreational hot spot just off the coast of Miami may host a school of these precious babies. If confirmed, the nursery would be the first ever identified in U.S. Atlantic waters for this iconic shark species.</p>



<p>Finding an endangered shark nursery in a vast ocean is like finding a needle in a haystack. While scientists have used satellites to track migrations of adult great hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>), where the sharks breed and give birth and where babies grow up is still “a bit of a mystery,” says shark scientist Catherine Macdonald of the University of Miami.</p>



<p>Macdonald investigates where and how sharks can thrive in areas that are heavily impacted by humans. One of those areas is Florida’s Biscayne Bay, a popular spot for fishing and boating that is polluted by urban runoff. There, she and colleagues regularly survey shark abundance and diversity using a catch-and-release system: Sharks that get hooked on baited lines are reeled in, documented, tagged and put back into the water.</p>



<p>Discovering a potential hammerhead shark nursery was an accident. The team got its first inkling of something special in June 2018, when researchers caught a juvenile great hammerhead — an interesting anomaly. In a decade of surveying, the team had never captured a hammerhead in these waters, says David Shiffman, a marine biologist at Arizona State University who is based in Washington, D.C. Several months later, the team caught another young hammerhead.</p>



<p>Over the next year and a half, “we kept catching them … every few months,” Macdonald says. So far, the team has documented <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.418">nine baby great hammerheads</a>, Macdonald, Shiffman and colleagues report July 11 in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>. Based on the sharks’ sizes — all under 200 centimeters long — they were less than 5 years old. The area where the young sharks have been found is fairly shallow and carpeted with seagrass, which probably provides protection and is rife with small fish to eat, the researchers suspect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="410" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1.jpg" alt="researchers measuring a baby hammerhead shark on top of a cooler" class="wp-image-3102062" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1-635x383.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1-308x186.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102062">Researchers on a boat in Florida’s Biscayne Bay measure a live juvenile great hammerhead shark before releasing it back into the water.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102062">Field School</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the Biscayne Bay site seems to be experiencing a hammerhead shark baby boom, officially designating the area as a nursery will require more monitoring. Juvenile sharks are more common at the site than other areas surveyed and the sharks come back to it for multiple years, the team says. But it’s unknown whether the sharks reside at the site for extended periods of weeks or months — the third and final <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2007/337/m337p287.pdf">criteria</a> for the site to qualify as a nursery.</p>



<p>Great hammerhead sharks breed infrequently, about once every two years. And the rate at which people catch and kill the sharks — both accidentally and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poached-hammerhead-fins-traced-endangered-populations">intentionally</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/09</em>) — contributed to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature listing the species as critically endangered in 2019. So when nursery areas are discovered, “it’s important they remain safe,” says marine biologist Jasmin Graham, President and CEO of Minorities in Shark Sciences, an organization that promotes diversity and inclusion in marine science. And while adult sharks have few predators other than people, “there’s a super high mortality rate for juveniles.” With an already unstable population, as many juveniles as possible that can survive to reproductive age is crucial, Graham says.</p>



<p>The possibility of an endangered shark nursery in Biscayne Bay fills Macdonald with hope, and she is working with conservation partners to get legal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-we-need-predators">protections</a> for this important site (<em>SN: 9/17/15</em>). “Even in such a heavily impacted place, it is possible for nature to be thriving,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/02/were-more-willing-to-engage-with-sexists-if-we-think-they-are-intelligent/">We’re More Willing To Engage With Sexists If We Think They Are Intelligent</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>For many readers, the idea of interacting with an overtly sexist person probably doesn’t sound particularly appealing — yet in many instances we <em>do</em> continue to engage with those who espouse sexist views. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2020.1819187">new study</a>, authored by Elena Agadullina from Russia’s National Research University Higher School of Economics, finds one factor that could determine whether we are likely to want to interact with a perpetrator of sexism: their intelligence. Participants preferred to interact with intelligent people — even those who had engaged in sexist behaviour.</p>



<span id="more-43091"></span>



<p>Participants, 348 Russian students, were sorted into three conditions. All read descriptions of a man named Peter; in one condition, Peter was described as having an IQ of 130; in another, Peter had a below average IQ of 100; and in the control condition participants received no information about his intelligence.</p>



<p>They were then separated into further conditions. In the sexist condition, Peter was described as someone who believes that women are not as intelligent as men, and that they should therefore work only on household chores, while participants in the non-sexist condition read that Peter believed women should have equal rights and opportunities. Finally, participants indicated how willing they would be to develop a relationship with Peter, be friends with him, or interact with him in everyday life (these were combined into a single measure of willingness to interact with Peter in the future).</p>



<p>Perceived intelligence played a significant role in participants’ choices about interactions. Overall, participants would rather interact with a non-sexist person than a sexist one. But intelligence mattered: they were more willing to interact with a sexist person when they read that he was intelligent than when they read he wasn’t. In fact, participants’ responses showed that they would rather engage with an intelligent sexist over an unintelligent <em>non-sexist</em>. This was the case for both men and women.</p>



<p>The second study looked at different manifestations of sexism. Participants read a story about either Peter or a woman named Sofia, who were described as either highly intelligent or unintelligent. They then either heard that Peter/Sofia had forced a young colleague into a sexual relationship or had innocently invited a colleague to a café to discuss work, before answering the same questions about interactions as in the first study.</p>



<p>This time, participants also completed a measure of their own sexism, indicating how much they agreed with six statements related to hostile sexism (such as “women seek to gain power by gaining control over men”) and benevolent sexism (“women should be cherished and protected by men”).</p>



<p>Again, participants preferred to interact with an intelligent harasser than a non-intelligent one. Interestingly, participants in the no sexual harassment condition were no more or less likely to want to engage with an intelligent than an unintelligent person.</p>



<p>Participants with high levels of hostile sexist attitudes themselves, on the other hand, were more likely to want to interact with an unintelligent woman, and in particular with an unintelligent woman harasser. This may be because the unintelligent woman character fit neatly within their worldview rather than challenging the status quo in any way.</p>



<p>One of Agadullina’s suggestions as to why participants preferred intelligent sexists is that people see sexism as a more malleable characteristic than intelligence: they may therefore make calculations about whether or not to interact with a sexist person on those grounds, believing they have the potential to change. Future research could look more closely at why knowing that an individual is intelligent overrides our better judgement about sexual harassment and sexism, as well as what other traits may also act as mitigating factors. Replicating the work in different cultural settings could also prove interesting.</p>



<p>Although the research focused on individual interactions, writing off sexism due to someone&#8217;s perceived intelligence has a wider impact: it can send the message that sexist behaviour is not particularly important if the perpetrator has other desirable characteristics. Continuing social and political work that highlights the importance of justice and equity for everyone remains key.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2020.1819187">When sexism is not a problem: The role of perceived intelligence in willingness to interact with someone who is sexist</a></p>

<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt in all areas of human life, from the impact on healthcare and the economy to education and the movement of people. The pandemic has also affected many sporting events, including the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo which was due to be hosted in 2020 but was postponed to 2021. With regional and national lockdowns and stay-at homes orders, training schedules for athletes have also been disrupted. To better understand the impacts on athletes with disabilities Piotr Urbański from Poznan University of Physical Education, Poland and colleagues decided to survey 166 athletes who were members of either the Polish Paralympic Committee or the Polish Sports Association for the Disabled’Start. The study found that the athletes were strongly affected by the pandemic and whilst a majority reported training at home, 12% stopped training altogether. Across the group the athletes reduced their training from 9.4h/week to 5.3h/week, highlighting the impact the pandemic has had on these athletes many of whom will be hoping to compete in the Paralympic games in August and September this year.</p>
<h4>Plasma-rich platelet products could help treat bilateral hip osteoarthritis in dogs &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-021-02913-x">BMC Veterinary Research</a></em></h4>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease affecting companion animals. In dogs, OA commonly affects the hip joint leading the reduced function and pain for the animals. There are limited treatment options available with most treatment focused on alleviating pain and improving joint function rather than treating the disease. Recently there has been interest in using of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to treat musculoskeletal disorders such as OA. Alves from the University of Evora, Portugal and colleagues from the Portuguese National Guard set out to test the use of PRP to treat police working dogs with bilateral hip OA.  After intra-articular administration of the PRP the team used a variety of scales including the Canine Brief Pain and Canine Orthopedic Indices to measure response to treatment. Compared to a control group receiving a saline treatment, the dogs treated with PRP saw improvements in pain and functional scores and no additional medication was required during the study’s follow-up period. The team concluded that PRP product could be a good therapeutic option for Hip OA in dogs.</p>
<h4>Mutant p53 affects chromatin accessibility in tumor cells through direct and indirect mechanisms &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08362-x">BMC Cancer</a></em></h4>

<p>The transcription factor, p53 encoded by the TP53 is a well characterized tumor suppressor and mutations in the gene sequence can affect its tumor suppressor activity. Some mutations can also result in a gain-of-function oncogenic activity. The effects of mutations on p53 binding to the genome has been well documented, but changes to chromatin accessibility has not been previously characterized. In their study, Bhavya Dhaka and Radhakrishnan Sabarinathan from National Centre for Biological Sciences, India use chromatin accessibility data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify regions in the genome where chromatin accessibility is altered in tumors with mutant p53. The pair identified 1587 and 984 areas where chromatin accessibility was lost and gained, respectively, in breast cancer and 1143 lost and 640 gained in colon cancer. Surprisingly, less than half the sites identified contained sequence motifs for p53 binding. However, these are regions associated with other transcriptional regulators, suggesting that gain-of-function p53 mutants utilizes both direct and indirect mechanisms to affect chromatin accessibility.</p>
<h4>USA National representative survey provides insight into factors affecting inequalities in accessing affordable, healthy food &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-021-00434-2">BMC Nutrition</a></em></h4>

<p>In recent years, inequalities in accessing high-quality and affordable food within the United States have been identified. This is primarily due the existence of food deserts – geographical regions where it is difficult to buy affordable, high-quality food –  within minority neighborhood. Much of the research to date has focused on assessing access and food-quality by using directories, census data and/or Geographic Information Systems. In their study Sansom and Hannibal from Texas A&amp;M School of Public Health, USA conducted a nationally representative survey to better understand the motivations and efforts that minority groups encounter to reach stores providing healthy food options. Their survey of 1612 participants found that saving money, having a good selection of food including organic foods were important factors for minority populations when choosing where to purchase food. In addition, driving less was a major consideration however, the survey demonstrated that minority groups across the USA need to drive for significantly longer their white counterparts to reach stores. The study from Sansom and Hannibal highlights the variety of issues that need to be tackled to reduce inequalities.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply shortages of various forms of personal protective equipment, including N95 and KN95 respirators used by healthcare professionals. This has led to masks being used for prolonged periods of time and in some cases being reused after decontamination procedures. However, the reusability of these masks is hampered by degradation of the fit of the masks. To try to improve the reusability, Malia McAvoy from Harvard Medical School, USA and colleagues set out to develop a mask frame for damaged and/or poor fitting masks. Using inexpensive 3D printing, the team developed a mask frame consisting of two printed side pieces connected by malleable wired links that allowed the user to mould the frame and mask against their face to recreate the tight fit. The frame is then held in place by elastic around the head. The team tested the fit on 45 volunteers with and without the mask frames on four different brands of either N95 or KN95 standard. For volunteers using masks with broken and effective straps an average of 85% passed the fit test, suggesting that the mask frames can prolong the lifespan of the masks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion">A super-short gamma-ray burst defies astronomers’ expectations</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprisingly short gamma-ray burst has astronomers rethinking what triggers these celestial cataclysms.</p>



<p>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a single-second-long blast of gamma rays, dubbed GRB 200826A, in August 2020. Such fleeting gamma-ray bursts, or GRBs, are usually thought to originate from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">neutron star smashups</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). But a closer look at the burst revealed that it came from the implosion of a massive star’s core.</p>



<p>In this scenario, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dying-stars-called-collapsars-may-forge-much-universe-gold">the core of a star collapses into a compact object</a>, such as a black hole, that powers high-speed particle jets. Those jets punch through the rest of the star and radiate powerful gamma rays before the outer layers of the star explode in a supernova (<em>SN: 5/8/19</em>). That process is typically thought to produce longer GRBs, lasting more than two seconds.</p>



<p>Discovering such a brief gamma-ray burst from a stellar explosion suggests that some bursts previously classified as stellar mergers may actually be from the deaths of massive stars, researchers report online July 26 in two studies in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The first clues about GRB 200826A’s origin came from the burst itself. The wavelengths of light and amount of energy released in the burst <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01395-z">were more similar to collapse-related GRBs</a> than collision-produced bursts, Bing Zhang, an astrophysicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and colleagues report. Plus, the burst hailed from the middle of a star-forming galaxy, where astronomers expect to find collapsing massive stars, but not neutron star mergers — which are generally found on the fringes of tranquil galaxies.</p>



<p>Another group, led by astronomer Tomás Ahumada-Mena of the University of Maryland in College Park, searched for the supernova that’s expected to follow a GRB produced by a collapsing star. Using the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii to observe GRB 200826A’s host galaxy, the team was able to pick out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01428-7">the telltale infrared light of the supernova</a>. The burst may have been so brief because its jets had just barely punched through the surface of the star before they petered out and the star blew up, Ahumada-Mena says.</p>

                <p class="">Devon had been a superstar student in high school, and by the time she was a freshman in college she already had her career path to becoming a physician mapped out. She was intelligent, ambitious, and seemingly destined for success. But by the end of her very first semester at college her life was in complete disarray. She appeared haggard and disheveled, was failing all of her classes, and displayed a paranoid mistrust of everyone around her. </p><p class="">Devon’s transformation began about mid-way through her first semester when she started to lose interest in academics—and everything else, it seemed; sometimes she just wanted to stay in bed all day. At first, she thought she might be suffering from depression, or at least some extreme form of homesickness due to her first prolonged stay away from her family. But she also started to notice that almost anywhere she went on campus people were staring and whispering about her. The whispers were critical—sometimes downright mean—and soon Devon started to hear them all the time, whether she was in earshot of others or not. It seemed to her that she was the focal point of everyone at her school—not only students, but also professors, staff, and visitors.</p><p class="">Devon eventually decided that all of these whispers and surreptitious glances harbored malicious intent. She had come to her university hoping to be recognized for her academic success, but now she began to believe that her professors, school administrators, and fellow students were involved in an intricate plot devised to see her fail. She decided she had been identified by a national surveillance system as someone who posed a threat to a medical system that was desperately attempting to hold onto its male dominance.</p><p class="">After that revelation, Devon’s life began to spiral out of control. She rarely went to class, and she tried to avoid everyone. Thinking her roommate was in on the plot against her, she would often sleep in a secluded corner of the library rather than go back to her dorm room. She refused to eat the potentially poisoned food from the school cafeteria, and she lost over 10 pounds. Classmates often saw her walking across campus with her eyes on the ground, muttering to herself. When her parents came to visit late in the semester, they realized the severity of the situation and checked Devon into the hospital.</p><h2><strong>Schizophrenia symptoms</strong></h2>

<p class="">Devon was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia, a potentially severe psychiatric condition <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia" target="_blank">that affects about 20 million people throughout the world</a>. Schizophrenia defies a clear and simple definition as it can look very different from one patient to the next. The disorder can involve a number of different symptoms; which symptoms are present varies from case to case.</p><p class="">Clinicians often categorize the symptoms of schizophrenia as <em>positive</em>, <em>negative</em>, or <em>cognitive</em>. Positive symptoms involve the development of a behavior or thought pattern that isn’t normally present in a healthy individual. These include psychosis, which is a disruption in reality that might involve delusional thinking like Devon’s paranoia. Hallucinations are also common; typically, the hallucinations are auditory in nature. Many schizophrenics, for example, hear voices in their heads that can sound as clear as if someone else in the room was talking. The critical whispers Devon heard would fall into this category.</p><p class="">Negative symptoms involve the loss of a behavior or function that is typically seen in a healthy individual. Examples include a lack of motivation that can resemble depression, blunted emotion, difficulty experiencing pleasure, and a decreased desire for social interaction.</p><p class="">Cognitive symptoms are those that affect someone’s ability to think clearly, and might involve deficits in attention, concentration, and/or memory.</p><p class="">Each patient with schizophrenia displays a unique combination of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The diverse presentation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25219520/">combined with supporting genetic data</a>) has led some to suggest that cases diagnosed as schizophrenia really may represent distinct disorders that are erroneously lumped together in one category.</p><h2><strong>Schizophrenia and the brain</strong></h2><p class="">Given the diverse nature of the condition, perhaps it’s not surprising that it has been difficult to identify specific aspects of brain function that are consistently pathological in schizophrenic patients. A great deal of research over the past half century, however, has focused on neurotransmitter abnormalities at the root of the disorder.</p><p class="">The neurotransmitter dopamine has received a lot of this attention. All of the drugs used to treat schizophrenia act to reduce dopamine activity, and drugs that increase dopamine levels (e.g., amphetamine) can induce behavior that in some ways resembles the psychotic states schizophrenic patients experience. Both of these observations support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is linked to some degree of dopamine dysregulation. There is also evidence that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730746/">dopamine synthesis and release in the brain is higher than normal</a> in schizophrenic patients. </p><p class="">Although dopamine has received the lion’s share of attention when it comes to neurotransmitter abnormalities in schizophrenia, researchers have also found that attempting to explain the varied symptoms of the disorder with fluctuations in the levels of one neurotransmitter is a somewhat futile task. This is one reason scientists have turned their focus to other neurotransmitter systems as well. The activity of the neurotransmitter glutamate, for example—a widespread, primarily excitatory, neurotransmitter—seems to also be dysregulated in schizophrenic patients. Some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21956446/" target="_blank">researchers think these glutamate abnormalities might be especially capable of accounting for the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia</a>—symptoms that dopamine irregularities have been less successful in explaining. </p><p class="">Thus, it may be that dopamine abnormalities are more responsible for positive symptoms like delusions and hallucinations, while glutamate abnormalities contribute more to negative symptoms. A case of schizophrenia, then, could potentially involve abnormalities in both dopamine and glutamate activity, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902122/" target="_blank">some hypotheses suggest</a> that altered glutamate signaling may lead to abnormalities in dopamine signaling.</p><p class="">Although they tend to get less research attention, other neurotransmitters like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14624191/" target="_blank">GABA</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954475/" target="_blank">serotonin</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32768486/" target="_blank">norepinephrine</a> have been implicated as well, further complicating the picture. </p><p class="">Despite decades of research, we are left with many questions about how these neurotransmitter abnormalities translate into schizophrenia symptoms. In other words, even if we can say with some confidence that dopamine and/or glutamate activity is dysregulated in schizophrenia, researchers are still trying to figure out how these neurotransmitter irregularities might lead to the diverse symptoms of the disorder. Thus, overall findings about abnormalities in neurotransmitter activity have been difficult to translate into a model that helps to explain the complex symptomatology of schizophrenia.</p><h2><strong>Neurodevelopmental origins and risk factors of schizophrenia</strong></h2><p class="">And then there is the question of what causes schizophrenia to emerge in the first place. The general thinking in this respect is that schizophrenia has its origins in early neural development, when a brain that is particularly susceptible—due perhaps to genetic makeup—experiences some insult while still in the womb. This fetal stress might alter neural development and subsequent brain function in a way that increases the likelihood of developing schizophrenia later in life. Why it would take a couple decades for that fetal stress to manifest into a psychiatric condition, however, is still unclear.</p><p class="">In support of this neurodevelopmental perspective, there is evidence that genetics makes a substantial contribution to the development of schizophrenia, and many of the genes that have been implicated in schizophrenia <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911319/" target="_blank">are also thought to play an important role in fetal development</a>. Additionally, complications during pregnancy or delivery and indicators of abnormal fetal development like low birth weight <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12091183/" target="_blank">are also considered risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life</a>. And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14609251/" target="_blank">babies who are born in late winter and spring have a slightly increased risk of developing schizophrenia</a>, which some have suggested may be linked to an increased likelihood of maternal respiratory infections or malnutrition (e.g., vitamin D deficiency) during the winter. </p><p class="">There are a number of other risk factors for schizophrenia, but their mechanistic connection to the condition has not been clearly established. For example: older fathers are more likely to have a child who develops schizophrenia, males are more likely to develop schizophrenia than females, higher rates of schizophrenia are found in urban environments, migrant populations have a greater risk of schizophrenia, childhood adversity like physical abuse or sexual abuse has been linked to schizophrenia, and drug abuse (e.g., heavy cannabis use) has been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. </p><h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2><p class="">The most common treatment for schizophrenia since the middle of the 20th century has been the use of antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic, was developed in the 1950s; since then, a long list of similar antipsychotic drugs have been brought to market. These drugs have an important mechanistic similarity in that they all act to block dopamine receptors to some degree. While antipsychotic drugs are relatively effective in reducing positive symptoms, however, they demonstrate little benefit in treating negative symptoms (which are often more functionally impairing than positive symptoms). And, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23810019/" target="_blank">many patients do not respond to antipsychotic drugs at all</a>.</p><p class="">Additionally, antipsychotic drugs have a problematic side effect profile. The dopamine receptor blockade caused by the drugs can lead to a number of side effects, including movement-related problems such as Parkinsonism (characterized by tremors, slow movement, rigidity, and postural impairments), dystonia (characterized by sustained involuntary muscle contractions, repetitive abnormal movements or fixed postures), akathisia (characterized by restlessness and an inability to sit still), and tardive dyskinesia (characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements). Tardive dyskinesia can persist even after the patient has stopped taking the drug; indeed, it is sometimes irreversible.</p><p class="">Newer drugs have been touted as being less likely to cause movement-related side effects, but no antipsychotic has been able to fully distance itself from this side effect profile. Additionally, newer antipsychotics (typically referred to as second-generation antipsychotics) have been linked to other problems like weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Thus, treatments for schizophrenia are less than ideal; researchers hope that a better understanding of the disorder will one day lead to improved therapeutic options.</p><h2>References (in addition to linked text above):</h2><p class="">Kahn RS, Sommer IE, Murray RM, Meyer-Lindenberg A, Weinberger DR, Cannon TD, O'Donovan M, Correll CU, Kane JM, van Os J, Insel TR.

The vast majority of studies have compared measures in COVID survivors to those obtained from participants without COVID.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">New delta variant studies show the pandemic is far from over</a></h4>

              
                <p>The coronavirus’s delta variant is different from earlier strains of the virus in worrying ways, health officials are discovering. And those differences may mean a return to some of the restrictions that vaccinated people thought were in the past.</p>



<p>The variant is not only more contagious than earlier strains, it also makes people sicker. And even vaccinated people can get infected and house similar levels of viral particles in their noses as unvaccinated people, raising concern about the vaccines’ ability to curb transmission, new data indicate. But experts caution that there&#8217;s more to infectiousness than just those viral levels in the nose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are five things to know about the new delta data:</p>



<h3>1. Vaccinated people can get infected with delta, but the vaccines are still working.&nbsp;</h3>





<p>Some 350 of about 470 people, nearly 75 percent, who caught the coronavirus in a large <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w">outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., were fully vaccinated</a>, researchers report July 30 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Public health officials linked many of those cases to packed indoor and outdoor events at places like bars and rental homes. The delta variant, which was first identified in India, was behind 120 of 133 analyzed COVID-19 cases, or 90 percent, in the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while it may sound like the vaccines didn’t do their job, the high proportion of cases in vaccinated people may be because of the county’s high vaccination rate, the researchers say; as of July 3, 70 percent of those eligible in Barnstable County are vaccinated. As more people in a community get vaccinated, the likelihood that someone who tests positive for the coronavirus has protection from the shots also goes up. That’s simply because the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Crucially, COVID-19 shots still protected vaccinated people from severe disease. While five people were hospitalized, including one unvaccinated person, as of July 27, no one had died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35,000 of the 162 million vaccinated people in the United States will develop a symptomatic infection every week. That’s about 21 COVID-19 cases in every 100,000 fully vaccinated people getting sick each week. That compares with about 179 infections among every 100,000 unvaccinated people per week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for hospitalization, two to three unvaccinated people out of every 100,000 will be hospitalized weekly with COVID-19 and roughly one person per 100,000 will die each week, according to CDC’s calculations. That’s about 25 times the number of fully vaccinated people facing the same fate. Among the fully vaccinated, 0.1 of 100,000 people will be hospitalized weekly and 0.04 per 100,000 will die each week.</p>



<h3>2. Vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta to others, but there’s a huge caveat to that.</h3>



<p>In that Massachusetts study, both unvaccinated and vaccinated people infected with the delta variant had similar levels of coronavirus genetic material in their noses, as measured by PCR, suggesting similar viral loads.<em> </em>Those elevated viral loads could mean that vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta than other coronavirus variants, despite being protected from the worst of COVID-19 themselves.</p>



<p>That “concerning” finding underpinned the agency’s recommendation from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">earlier in the week</a> that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain instances, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a July 30 statement (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this finding comes with major caveats. The result “just gives you an indication of how much viral RNA is in the sample, it tells you nothing about infectiousness,” says Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. These data “are a cause for concern, but this is not a definitive answer on transmissibility” from vaccinated people, she says.</p>



<p>When a vaccinated person gets infected and becomes symptomatic, “we already knew that they’d have higher viral loads,” Butler-Wu says. But the immune response jump-started by the vaccine may hamstring many of those viral particles.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Many of these viral particles are likely coated in antibodies,” says Brett Lindenbach, a virologist at Yale University, meaning the viral particles “should be less infectious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The delta variant may spread more easily from vaccinated people than earlier variants, he says, but definitively demonstrating that would require detailed studies that document transmission events from vaccinated people to others. Still, both Lindenbach and Butler-Wu say that mask wearing, for vaccinated and unvaccinated people, can help slow the spread of the delta variant.</p>



<h3>3. The delta variant can actually make people sicker.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three recent studies in Canada, Singapore and Scotland indicate that the variant raises the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto analyzed data from the province of Ontario to see if different coronavirus variants made people sicker. She and colleague David Fisman had information about who got infected and what the outcome of the infection was. Even after accounting for vaccination, age and underlying health conditions, the delta variant carried a 120 percent increased risk of hospitalization, 287 percent increased risk of ICU admission and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2">137 percent increased risk of death</a>, the researchers report July 12 at medRxiv.org. “And that’s on top of what we see with alpha,” Tuite says. </p>



<p>In Singapore, a preliminary study in the <em>Lancet</em> posted June 7 to the preprint server SSRN found that the<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3861566"> delta variant nearly doubles the risk of pneumonia</a> compared with earlier strains and carries an increased risk of needing supplemental oxygen, being admitted to the ICU and dying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those preliminary data haven’t been reviewed by other scientists yet, but agree with data published in the <em>Lancet </em>June 14 from a study in Scotland. There, researchers found that the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext">delta variant doubles the risk of hospitalization</a> compared with the alpha variant.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the vaccines work slightly less well against the delta variant than they did against earlier strains. Still, vaccination reduces the risk of these serious complications. Vaccines are like using an extinguisher on a kitchen fire, says Paul Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The goal is to keep the rest of the house from burning down.” The virus can enter cells in the nose, throat and lungs and start to replicate there, “so you can have an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease,” Offit says.</p>



<p>But then, a vaccinated person’s immune system will kick in after a couple of days and prevent the infection from causing more severe disease, he says. “It’s easier to prevent moderate to severe disease than it is to prevent mild disease.”</p>



<h3>4. Delta is much more transmissible than previous forms of the coronavirus.</h3>



<p>An unvaccinated person infected with the ancestral version of the virus that first emerged at the end of 2019 typically transmitted the virus to two to four people on average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone infected with the delta variant, however, might pass the virus on to five to 10 others on average. That’s nearly on par with the contagiousness of chicken pox, <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/8a726408-07bd-46bd-a945-3af0ae2f3c37/note/57c98604-3b54-44f0-8b44-b148d8f75165.#page=1">internal CDC documents</a> first obtained and published by the <em>Washington Post</em> show.</p>



<h3>5. Public health measures like vaccination and masks remain crucial tools.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The CDC recommended a return to masking, because it is one of the most effective tools to prevent infection.</p>



<p>N95 masks are effective in all settings, but surgical masks fare best when the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1439">concentration of viruses in the air is low</a>, an international group of researchers calculated in a June 25 <em>Science </em>study. And their calculations suggest the masks work best against both getting an infection and spreading it when everyone is wearing a mask. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks protect better</a> than ones that have gaps at the top or sides, previous studies have demonstrated (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three-layer <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e1.htm">cotton cloth masks are also effective</a>, researchers reported July 2 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Researchers tested how many stand-ins for virus-carrying aerosol particles mannequin heads “breathed” with and without cotton masks. If all the dummies wore masks, the combined concentration of aerosol particles in the air was 72 percent lower than the number of airborne particles when none of the mannequins were masked.</p>



<p>Combining masks with proper <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">ventilation and filtration may be even more helpful</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). In the mannequin study, researchers also placed two HEPA filters in various locations around the room. HEPA filtration cut exposure to airborne particles by 65 percent compared with no filtration and no masks. When all the mannequins were masked and the HEPA filters were on, the average particle concentration was reduced 90 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Cockatoos in Sydney know how to raid household bins <strong>—</strong> and, intriguingly, this is a behaviour that they seem to have learned from each other. </strong>Researchers found that before 2018, cockatoos in just a few suburbs were able to “dumpster dive”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/australia-s-cockatoos-are-masters-dumpster-diving-and-now-they-re-learning-each-other">reports Cathleen O’Grady</a> at <em>Science, </em>but over time the behaviour spread out from those original locations. The team even found that there are local “subcultures” of cockatoos that have different strategies for opening the bins.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peru-skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim">A skeleton from Peru vies for the title of oldest known shark attack victim</a></h4>

              
                <p>When news broke that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">oldest known case of a person killed by a shark</a> involved a member of Japan’s Jōmon culture around 3,000 years ago, two researchers took special notice (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>Back in 1976, bioarchaeologist Robert Benfer of the University of Missouri in Columbia and Harvard University anthropological archaeologist Jeffrey Quilter had participated in an excavation of a roughly 17-year-old boy’s skeleton that bore signs of a fatal shark encounter. The boy’s left leg was missing and his right hip and right forearm bones displayed deep bite marks characteristic of those made by sharks, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“Successful shark bites usually involve tearing off a limb, often a leg, and ingesting it,” Benfer says. An unsuccessful attempt to ward off a shark presumably resulted in the boy’s arm injuries.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating indicated that the teen, whose remains were discovered at a Peruvian village site called Paloma, died around 6,000 years ago before being placed in a grave unlike any others in his community, says Benfer, who directed investigations at Paloma in 1976 and in three more field seasons that concluded in 1990. That could make the teen the oldest known shark attack victim.</p>





<p>Quilter went on to describe the youth’s shark-related injuries in two paragraphs in a 1989 book, <a href="https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781587293993/life-and-death-at-paloma"><em>Life and Death at Paloma</em></a>. But the results were never published in an academic journal. Quilter and Benfer e-mailed the excerpt to the Jōmon researchers on July 26. “We were unaware of their claim until now, but are keen to speak to them about it in more detail,” says University of Oxford archaeologist J. Alyssa White, who led the Jōmon team.</p>



<p>Paloma lies in hills about 3.5 kilometers from Peru’s Pacific coast. Small groups intermittently lived there in round, reed huts between around 7,800 and 4,000 years ago. Paloma’s residents primarily fished, collected or dove for shellfish, and gathered edible plants.</p>



<p>A majority of the 201 human graves excavated at Paloma were dug beneath or just outside reed huts. But the young man with a missing leg was buried in a long, oval pit dug in an open area and left unfilled. Excavators found remains of a grid of canes that had been tied together and covered with several woven mats to form a cover or roof over the body. Items placed in the grave included a seashell, a large, flat rock and several ropes, one with elaborate knots and a tassel at one end.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/utdtRG6AyfE/">Impact AND credibility matter when researchers evaluate research</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>by Veronique Kiermer, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, &amp; James Harney.</strong></p>



<p>Today we&rsquo;ve posted a <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ryds4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, along with accompanying data, on qualitative research we conducted about how researchers assess the credibility and impact of research. This study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was supported by a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> and conducted with the assistance of the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Cell Biology</a>. The findings will inform future PLOS activities to support improved research assessment practices &mdash; specifically to support efforts to move emphasis towards individual research outputs and away from journal-level metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/how-do-researchers-evaluate-research/">wrote </a>in October 2020, we are interested in how researchers evaluate research outputs when (1) conducting their own research, and (2) when they take part in committees for hiring or grant review. In particular, we were interested in how researchers make judgments about the <em>credibility</em> and<em> impact </em>of the research outputs &mdash; including papers, preprints, research data &mdash; that they encounter in these contexts.</p>



<p>We interviewed 52 cell biology researchers.&nbsp; Our approach focused on the goals they are trying to achieve (e.g.&rdquo;identify impactful research to read&rdquo;), rather than the tools they are presently using to carry out these tasks. By focusing on researchers&rsquo; goals (the <em>what</em>) rather than <em>how</em> they are achieving them, we sought to better understand how we might influence those practices. This qualitative research will be followed by survey work to better quantify our findings. This will provide insights into opportunities for better solutions for improved research assessment. In particular, we&rsquo;ll understand what signals of credibility and impact might provide researchers with more useful ways than journal impact factor or journal prestige to assess the quality and credibility of individual studies and individual researchers.</p>



<p>Our results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the <em>credibility</em> (or trustworthiness) of research outputs is the central concern for researchers when conducting their own research, and that <em>impact</em> was a strong focus when researchers are part of hiring or grant review committees. But we established that researchers also assess attributes of research outputs related to reproducibility, quality, and novelty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we found that researchers said they assessed credibility in committees more frequently than we anticipated, given that impact considerations &mdash; including journal impact factor &mdash; are prevalent in committee guidance and research assessment objectives (see for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McKiernan et al</a>. (2019), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niles et al.</a> (2020), <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:32909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alperin et al.</a> (2020), and <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-research-9780190640125?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugimoto &amp; Larivi&egrave;re</a> (2018)).</p>



<p>Our interviews confirmed that convenient proxies for credibility and impact, usually those based on journals, are used pervasively and are common in both research discovery and committee activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research also indicates that when researchers inspect publications to evaluate credibility they try to minimize the amount of time they spend reading and understanding publications. Their tactics included selective reading of the abstracts, figures, and methods sections. Sometimes they said that they also look for signals such as whether data was available and had been reused, whether peer-reviewed versions of preprints have been published, and whether open peer review reports were available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insights that help us better understand what researchers&rsquo; goals are and how they make judgements about credibility when discovering and reading research may offer opportunities to provide more reliable signals that help them with these tasks, yet are better tailored for credibility judgments than journal-level metrics. The stated importance of assessing credibility by researchers who participate in research assessment committees also suggests an opportunity for funders and institutions to better align their guidelines with the practice and motivations of committee members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our follow-up survey work to validate these preliminary findings, we will report back and hope that this research will help others in the understanding and development of better methods of research assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-wasp-larvae-caterpillars">Viruses can kill wasp larvae that grow inside infected caterpillars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When parasitic wasps come calling, some caterpillars have a surprising ally: a viral infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insects called parasitoid wasps lay their eggs inside young moth larvae, turning the caterpillars into unwitting, destined-to-die incubators for possibly hundreds of wasp offspring. That’s bad news for viruses trying to use the caterpillars as replication factories. For the caterpillars, viral infections can be lethal, but their chances of survival are probably higher than if wasps choose them as a living nursery.</p>



<p>Now, a study shows how certain viruses can help caterpillars stymie parasitoid wasps. A group of proteins dubbed parasitoid killing factor, or PKF, that are found in some insect viruses <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6396">are incredibly toxic to young parasitoid wasps,</a> researchers report in the July 30 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The new finding shows that viruses and caterpillars can come together to fight off a common wasp enemy, says study coauthor Madoka Nakai, an insect virologist at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. A parasitoid wasp would kill a host that the virus needs to survive, so the virus fights for its home. “It’s very clever,” Nakai says.</p>





<p>What’s more, some moth caterpillars make the wasp-killing proteins themselves, the team found. It’s possible that in the distant past, a few moths survived a viral infection and “got some presents” in the form of genetic instructions for how to make the proteins, says study coauthor Salvador Herrero, an insect pathologist and geneticist at the University of Valencia in Spain. Those insects could have then passed the ability down to offspring. In this case, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” Herrero says.</p>



<p>Previous studies had shown that viruses and insects, including moths, can swap genes with each other. The new finding is one of the latest examples of this activity, says Michael Strand, an entomologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“Parasite-host relationships are very specialized,” he says. “Factors like [PKF] are probably important in defining which hosts can be used by which parasites.” But whether caterpillars stole the genetic instructions for the proteins from viruses or if viruses originally stole the instructions from another host remains unclear, Strand says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered in the 1970s that virus-infected caterpillars could <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/168/3928/251">kill parasitoid wasp larvae using an unknown viral protein</a>. In the new study, Herrero and colleagues identified PKF as wasp-killing proteins. The team infected moth caterpillars with one of three insect viruses that carry the genetic blueprints to make the proteins. Then the researchers either allowed wasps to lay their eggs in the caterpillars or exposed wasp larvae to hemolymph — the insect equivalent of blood — from infected caterpillars.  </p>



<p>Virus-infected caterpillars were poor hosts of the parasitoid wasp <em>Cotesia kariyai</em>; most young wasps died before they had the chance to emerge from the caterpillars into the world. Hemolymph from infected caterpillars was also an efficient killer of wasp larvae, typically destroying more than 90 percent of offspring.</p>



<p><em>C.</em> <em>kariyai</em> wasp larvae also didn’t survive in caterpillars, including the beet armyworm (<em>Spodoptera exigua</em>), that make their own PKF. When the researchers blocked the genes for the proteins in these caterpillars, the wasps lived, a sign that the proteins are key for the caterpillars’ defenses.</p>



<p>Some parasitoid wasps, including <em>Meteorus pulchricornis</em>, weren’t affected by PKF from the viruses and also beet armyworms, allowing the wasp offspring to thrive inside caterpillars. That finding suggests that the wasp-fighting ability is species-specific, says Elisabeth Herniou, an insect virologist at CNRS and the University of Tours in France who was not involved in the work. Pinpointing why some wasps aren’t susceptible could reveal the details of a long-held evolutionary battle between all three types of organisms.  </p>



<p>The study highlights that “single genes can interfere with the outcome of [these] interactions,” Herniou says. “One virus may have this gene and the other virus doesn’t have it,” and that can change what happens when virus, caterpillar and parasitoid all collide.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-chicxulub-earth-largest-ripple-marks-tsunami">Dinosaur-killing asteroid may have made Earth’s largest ripple marks</a></h4>

              
                <p>The asteroid impact that slew the dinosaurs may have also indirectly sculpted the largest ripple marks ever found on Earth.</p>



<p>A series of ridgelike structures more than three stories high and spaced nearly two Eiffel Towers apart appear to be buried about 1,500 meters beneath central Louisiana. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X21003186?via%3Dihub">The oversized features are megaripples shaped by a massive tsunami</a> generated by the Chicxulub asteroid impact, researchers report in the Sept. 15 <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s just interesting that something that happened 66 million years ago could be so well preserved, buried 5,000 feet down in the sediments of Louisiana,” says geologist Gary Kinsland of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.</p>



<p>Ripple marks are repeating sequences of ridges typically found on sandy beaches or stream bottoms that form as wind or water flows over and moves loose sediment. But ripple marks on the beach are often centimeters in height, while the structures found by Kinsland’s team have an average height of 16 meters and are spaced about 600 meters apart.</p>





<p>The marks’ shape, size, orientation and location suggest that they formed after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dino-dooming-asteroid-impact-created-chilling-sulfur-cloud">the Chicxulub asteroid</a> crashed into what is today’s Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, generating a tsunami that washed across the sediments of the Gulf of Mexico and over what is now Louisiana, which was underwater at the time (<em>SN: 11/2/17</em>). Despite the tsunami’s width, no one has ever found ripple marks formed by the wave before.</p>



<p>Geologist Kaare Egedahl initially discovered the newly described ripples while searching for coal deposits. Studying at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette at the time, Egedahl had been combing through seismic reflection data – 3-D images of buried rock and soil generated by underground sound waves — provided by the Devon Energy company. Egedahl, now at the oil and gas company Cantium, found the ripples atop a layer of rock thought to have formed from debris shaken up by the Chicxulub asteroid impact. He then shared his finding with Kinsland.</p>

<p>“I knew where that layer was from in geologic time, and I knew what happened there,” Kinsland says. “I knew there should be a tsunami.”</p>



<p>The supposed ripple marks were preserved all this time thanks to the depth at which they formed underwater, Kinsland says. Other studies suggest that the region of present-day Louisiana in which the ripples took shape was 60 meters below the sea surface at the time. At that depth, the ripples would have been beyond the reach of tumultuous storm activity that could have erased them. Then, over millions of years, the marks were slowly buried by other sediments.</p>



<p>A smaller, analogous set of structures may exist off the east coast of Japan. There, a repeating sequence of underwater dunes was reported to have appeared after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Those dunes look nearly identical to the ripple marks buried beneath Louisiana, except for their size, Kinsland says, supporting the notion that the taller structures were also produced by a tsunami, though one of a much larger magnitude.</p>



<p>Still, there is contention over whether the features beneath Louisiana really are megaripples formed by the Chicxulub tsunami.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to see how such a high-energy event could form ripple marks because they are usually associated with much calmer environments,” says sedimentologist Pedro J.M. Costa of the Universidade de Coimbra in Portugal. And ripple marks typically form from frequent and recurring wave motion, while tsunamis don’t have many waves, he explains. Costa, who is an expert on tsunami deposits, says that reconstructing the lay of the seafloor at that time of the impact and conducting experiments could help unravel the origins of the structures found by Kinsland’s team.</p>



<p>This new work is important because it opens a discussion, Costa says. “Maybe [the Chicxulub impact was] such a high-magnitude event that what we see in normal tsunami events don’t apply to this one.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bears-bludgeon-walrus-stones-tools-ice-inuit">Polar bears sometimes bludgeon walruses to death with stones or ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Walruses, weighing as much as 1,300 kilograms with huge tusks and nearly impenetrable skulls, are almost impossible for a hungry polar bear to kill. But new research suggests that some polar bears have invented a work-around — bashing walruses on the head with a block of stone or ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>For more than 200 years, Inuit in Greenland and the eastern Canadian Arctic have told stories of polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) using such tools to aid in killing walruses. Yet explorers, naturalists and writers often dismissed such accounts, relegating them to myth along with tales about shape-shifting bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The persistence of these reports, including one report from an Inuk hunter in the late 1990s, coupled with photos of a male polar bear named GoGo at a Japanese zoo using tools to obtain suspended meat compelled Ian Stirling and colleagues to investigate further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been my general observation that if an experienced Inuit hunter tells you that he’s seen something, it’s worth listening to and very likely to be correct,” says Stirling, one of the world’s leading polar bear biologists.</p>





<p>The researchers reviewed historical, secondhand observations of tool use in polar bears reported by Inuit hunters to explorers and naturalists as well as recent observations by Inuit hunters and non-Inuit researchers and documented observations of GoGo and brown bears — polar bears’ closest relatives — using tools in captivity to access food. This review suggests&nbsp;that <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/arctic/article/view/72532">tool use in wild polar bears, though infrequent, does occur in the case of hunting walruses</a> because of their large size, the researchers report in the June <em>Arctic</em>.</p>



<p>“Really, the only species you would want to bonk on the head with a piece of ice would be a walrus,” says Andrew Derocher, director of the Polar Bear Science Lab at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who wasn’t involved with the new study. He suspects that it might just be a few polar bears that do this behavior. For example, if a mother bear figured out how to use ice or stone in this way, “it’s something her offspring would pick up on,” but not necessarily a skill polar bears across the Arctic would acquire, he says.</p>



<p>Among animals, using tools to solve problems has long been regarded as a marker of a higher level of what humans consider intelligence. Notoriously smart chimpanzees, for example, <a href="http://sciencenews.org/article/tools-prey-female-chimps-move-fore-hunting">craft spears</a> to hunt smaller mammals (<em>SN: 2/28/07</em>). Dolphins carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-moms-dolphins-learn-tool-use-their-mothers">marine sponges</a> in their mouths to stir sand and uncover prey (<em>SN: 6/8/05</em>). And elephants have been known to drop logs or large rocks onto electric fences to cut off the power supply.</p>



<p>Studies on the cognitive abilities of polar bears are lacking. “We don’t know anything experimental or objective at all,” Stirling says. “However, we have a great deal of observational information that tends to suggest polar bears are really smart.”</p>



<p>Members of the bear family, Ursidae, are typically assumed to have strong cognitive skills as a result of their large brains and evidenced by their sophisticated hunting strategies. Studies on captive American black bears have even revealed some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398692/">mental capabilities that appear to exceed those of primates</a>.</p>

<p>Gabriel Nirlungayuk, an Inuk hunter of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, Canada, says he has heard such stories of polar bears using tools to hunt walruses. “I’ve seen polar bears since I was probably 7 years old. I’ve been around them, I’ve hunted alongside them, and I have seen their behaviors. The smartest hunters are usually the female bears.” Sometimes, he says, polar bears will trick young seals to come closer by pretending to be asleep in open water. Other times he’s observed that a polar bear can sniff out a seal’s breathing hole in ice, even if it’s obscured by snow.</p>



<p>“I have worked with the Inuit on traditional knowledge for a very long time and one of my favorite subjects is polar bears, because science often suggests one thing and the Inuit say another thing,” he notes.</p>



<p>There are around 26,000 wild polar bears living in 19 subpopulations across the Arctic and sub-Arctic. The bears primarily eat seals, hunting the marine mammals by staking out above their breathing holes. Because of climate change, Arctic sea ice is fast disappearing, and scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0818-9">predict</a> that many polar bear populations will be extinct by the century’s end. Desperate polar bears may increasingly attack walruses, but “there are limitations to how many walruses an adult bear can take down,” says coauthor Kristin Laidre, an Arctic ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. It takes a lot of energy.</p>



<p>Following publication of the new study, Stirling received a video from U.S. Geological Survey scientist Anthony Pagano, based in Anchorage, Alaska, who had previously attached a GoPro camera to a wild polar bear for a separate project. That footage, Stirling says, shows a <a href="https://youtu.be/qXQBjZLNYT0?t=779">female polar bear sliding a large block of ice</a> around before throwing it into the water at a seal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-fossils-tubes-890-million-year-old-rock-ancient-sea-sponge">If confirmed, tubes in 890-million-year-old rock may be the oldest animal fossils</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pale, wormlike tubes in 890-million-year-old rock may be ancient sea sponges, a new study concludes. If confirmed, that controversial claim would push back the origin of the earliest sponges by about 350 million years and make the tiny squiggles the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03773-z">oldest known fossils of animals</a>, by far.</p>



<p>Crucially, these fossils would imply that animals emerged in environmental conditions previously thought unworkable for animal life, geologist Elizabeth Turner reports July 28 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Early in Earth’s history, the ocean mostly lacked oxygen. It wasn’t until a large pulse of the gas to the atmosphere about 800 million to 540 million years ago, known as the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event, brought atmospheric oxygen levels to within 10 to 50 percent of modern levels, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-might-not-have-needed-major-event-become-oxygen-rich">boosting the amount of oxygen in surface ocean waters</a> (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). “But sponges are different from other animals,” says Turner, of Laurentian University in Sudbury, Canada. “Some sponges in the modern world and in the rock record are known to be tolerant of comparatively low oxygen relative to modern ocean levels.”</p>



<p>Until now, the earliest, unambiguous fossils of sponges date to about 540 million years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, when an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-boost-aided-carnivore-evolution-cambrian-explosion">extreme burst</a> in the evolution of animal diversity took place (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/29/13</em>). Some other animals are known from just a bit earlier, but go <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/possible-ancestor-sponges-found">too much further back in time</a> and identities become less clear (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/9/15</em>).&nbsp;Based on genetic data and their relative simplicity, sponges are generally thought to have been the earliest form of animal life.</p>







<p>But some scientists aren’t convinced that the newly described tubes are sponge fossils. “Organisms from anywhere on the tree of life can make wiggly, little [branching and rejoining] structures,” says Jonathan Antcliffe, a paleobiologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. The fossils lack features such as mineralized skeletal parts called spicules that would identify the creatures as sponges, he says.</p>



<p>What’s more, the finding “doesn&#8217;t fit with everything we know about the whole [ocean] ecosystem” in regards to nutrient, biomineral and oxygen availability before the Cambrian Period, Antcliffe says. “Everything we know about the Earth&#8217;s oceans in this interval of time tells us that animals originated around 540 [to] 550 million years ago. It’s a legion of evidence, and to overturn such an enormously strong paradigm, you need more than ‘might be a sponge.’”</p>



<p>Turner first found the network of tubes in 1992 in rocks from the ancient Little Dal cyanobacteria reef in Canada’s Mackenzie Mountains. “I found this thing that was totally out of place,” she says. “It was much more complex in terms of its structure than anything that could be made by cyanobacteria.”</p>

<p>She would have reported the curious squiggles then, but without much else to tie them to sponges besides a general resemblance, Turner moved on. But after <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/jsedres/article-abstract/77/7/552/145145/Degradative-Calcification-of-a-Modern-Siliceous?redirectedFrom=fulltext">more recent research</a> showed that sponges could be preserved in rock similarly to the Little Dal’s pallid wiggles, she returned to her find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turner argues that many modern sponges don’t have spicules and that the newly described fossils may be similar. And she suggests that sponges predating the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event may have scraped out an existence in “oxygen oases” along microbial reefs, living in holes and reef flanks and not competing with cyanobacteria for space.</p>



<p>It’s possible that early sponges emerged much earlier than the rest of animal life and remained in a kind of “evolutionary stasis” in low-oxygen conditions, she says, with the evolution of later, more complex animals having to wait until the gas became more abundant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have known about odd types of fossils in the Little Dal reef for a while, says James Schiffbauer, a paleobiologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia who wasn’t involved in the research.&nbsp;And “we’ve expected from molecular clocks that sponges should be present earlier in the Neoproterozoic [Era],” he adds, referring to genetic analyses that estimate that sponges evolved well before the Cambrian Period. “It has just been a matter of finding them if they were indeed preserved.”</p>



<p>Future research could help confirm the fossils’ identity. Turner plans to work more with the ancient tubes, adding that more answers may come from looking in the right places. “We need to be looking for similar material with a really open mind in rocks of similar age, and we need to be looking for more complex animal evidence in them as well,” rather than just simpler organisms like microbes.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>What makes something go viral online? A lot of work has highlighted the role of emotion: social media posts that express strong emotions — and particularly negative emotions — tend to spread further.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/26/e2024292118.short?rss=1&amp;__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_bd883c6c8345c6cc6aa44fcf30a1e828c6a1fe6a-1627479224-0-gqNtZGzNAfijcnBszQii">a study</a> in <em>PNAS </em>has identified another factor which seems to have an even greater effect on how often posts are shared. Steve Rathje from the University of Cambridge and colleagues find that tweets and Facebook posts that contain more language referring to political opponents get more shares. These posts may be so popular, the team finds, because they appeal to feelings of anger and outrage towards the political out-group.</p>



<span id="more-43045"></span>



<p>The first study looked at hundreds of thousands of tweets and Facebook posts made in the last few years by media outlets with either a liberal (e.g. <em>The New York Times</em>) or conservative (e.g. <em>Fox News</em>) outlook. The team were interested in how the language of the social media posts related to how often those posts were shared. Using existing dictionaries designed for text analysis research, they looked at how many negative and positive emotion words (e.g. “hate” or “happy”) each post contained, as well has how many “moral-emotional” words it had (these are words that are contained in both dictionaries of moral and emotional words, like “destroy”, “peace”, or “victim”).</p>



<p>The researchers also compared the text against “Republican” and “Democrat” dictionaries. These contained the names of politicians and political terms related to either party — so “Donald Trump” and “right-wing” were in the Republican dictionary, for example, while “Pete Buttigieg” and “leftist” were in the Democrat one.</p>



<p>The team found that posts were shared more often when they contained more negative emotion words: every additional negative emotion word was associated with a 5-8% increase in the number of times a post was shared (with the exception of Facebook posts by conservative media). Similarly, each additional positive word <em>decreased</em> the number of shares by 2-11%. Moral-emotional words had an even stronger effect, increasing the number of shares by 10-17%.</p>



<p>These findings are broadly consistent with past work finding that people tend to share negative and morally-laden posts online. However, the really interesting finding came from the analysis of political language. More “in-group” language (e.g. liberal media posts containing words from the Democrat dictionary) was generally related to more shares. But the biggest effect came from “out-group” language (e.g. liberal media posts containing words from the Republican dictionary): each additional out-group word boosted shares by a whopping 35-57%.</p>



<p>A second study took the same approach, but looked at posts by members of Congress instead. And the results were pretty much the same: negative and moral-emotion words were related to more shares, but this was eclipsed by the far bigger effect of out-group language. In this case, each additional out-group word increased shares by 65-180%. Looking at the results across both studies, the team conclude that, overall, each political out-group word increased shares by around 67% — several times larger than the effect of negative or moral-emotional words.</p>



<p>Posts about the political outgroup are presumably usually quite hostile, and this could be what drives engagement. The team found some indirect evidence that this was the case, by examining how the audience used Facebook’s reaction emojis. They found that posts with more political out-group language provoked more “angry” and “haha” reactions, suggesting that these posts tended to be designed to provoke anger or mockery. More in-group language, on the other hand, predicted more “love” reactions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, then, the results suggest that people tend to share social media posts which allow them to express their social or political identity — particularly those which disparage political opponents. This has implications for understanding why social media — and the political landscape more widely — has become so polarised, the authors write. For instance, we’re often concerned about social media becoming an “echo chamber”, where people only hear from others who they agree with. The study suggests the problem isn’t simply that people only hear from their in-group, but that the posts they are most likely to see may actively promote animosity towards the out-group.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, things may not change any time soon. There are benefits to going viral: politicians or media outlets might gain followers, while social media companies rely on audience engagement for revenue. So this kind of polarising content is actually being incentivised by the very structure of the social media platforms, the team writes. “Content expressing out-group animosity may be good at generating superficial engagement while ultimately harming individuals, political parties, or society in the long-term,” they conclude.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-water-bear-vision-color-light">Near-invincible tardigrades may see only in black and white</a></h4>

              
                <p>Next time you’re looking at a rainbow, be thankful you’re not a tardigrade. While the microscopic creatures, also known as water bears, are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-bears-will-survive-end-world-we-know-it">master survivors</a> when it comes to radiation, space or extreme temperatures (<em>SN: 7/14/17</em>), they may lack one way to appreciate the world they live in: the ability to see in color.</p>



<p>Tardigrades’ close arthropod relatives can see color and ultraviolet light. But tardigrades don’t have the same light-sensing proteins, called opsins, that arthropods do. That means they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evab164/6320065">might not be able to see either visible or UV light</a>, researchers report July 13 in <em>Genome Biology and Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>While working at Keio University Institute of Advanced Biosciences in Yamagata, Japan, evolutionary biologist James Fleming and colleagues cataloged which opsins tardigrades have. Then the team used genetic analysis to figure out whether these opsins were active or not in two species: <em>Hypsibius exemplaris </em>and <em>Ramazzottius variornatus</em>.</p>



<p>Despite having active opsins, <em>R. variornatus</em> doesn’t have eyes — a problem for seeing things. Still, “it’s doing something with [the opsins],” says Fleming, now at the University of Oslo Natural History Museum. What exactly that is remains unknown.</p>





<p><em>H. exemplaris </em>have eyes but don’t have opsins that can respond to multiple types of light, the team found — a crucial trait to detect different colors. And tardigrade eyes are fairly simple, Fleming says. Even with additional opsins, they can&#8217;t make out images. In a more complex eye, those additional opsins might create vision that resembles a black and white silent film instead of a murky 1800s photo, he says.</p>



<p>Many of the opsin genes also were more active when the critters were eggs than when they were adults. “Understandably, there is not a lot of ecological use for being able to see whilst you’re inside of an egg,” Fleming says. But there might be other light-sensitive processes important for the egg’s development. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings don’t entirely rule out whether tardigrades might see color. “Color vision in general is a very messy topic,” Fleming says. Directly testing water bears’ eyes would help researchers know for sure.</p>

Now, arXiv is partnering with a wide range of organizations across the scientific community, including the US National Laboratories, on a transgender-inclusive name-change process for academic work. This agreement will allow researchers who wish to change their names to more easily claim work from all stages of their careers; it specifically addresses the administrative and emotional difficulties some transgender researchers have experienced when requesting name changes associated with past academic work. For researchers of all genders, and transgender researchers specifically, the new process ensures they can rightfully claim ownership of prior work without fear of reprisal under their lived name and be known in their respective fields primarily through their merits as authors. The partnership between the national laboratories, major scientific publishers, journals, and other organizations represents a commitment to creating a more inclusive culture in STEM fields and STEM publishing in particular.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-dot-exomoon-evidence-exoplanet-moon-stars-astronomy">The tiny dot in this image may be the first look at exomoons in the making</a></h4>

              
                <p>New telescope images may provide the first view of moons forming outside the solar system.</p>



<p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile glimpsed a dusty disk of potentially moon-forming material around a baby exoplanet about 370 light-years from Earth. The Jupiter-like world is surrounded by enough material <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac0f83">to make up to 2.5 Earth moons</a>, researchers report online July 22 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Observations of this system could offer new insight into how planets and moons are born around young stars.</p>



<p>ALMA observed two planets, dubbed PDS 70b and 70c, circling the star PDS 70 in July 2019. Unlike most other known exoplanets, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-snap-first-baby-pictures-planet">these two Jupiter-like worlds are still forming</a> — gobbling up material from the disk of gas and dust swirling around their star (<em>SN: 7/2/18</em>). During this formation process, planets are expected to wrap themselves in their own debris disks, which control how planets pack on material and form moons.</p>



<p>Around PDS 70c, ALMA spotted a disk of dust about as wide as Earth’s orbit around the sun. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler">previously reported exomoon sightings still controversial</a>, the new observations offer some of the best evidence yet that planets orbiting other stars have moons (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike PDS 70c, 70b does not appear to have a moon-forming disk. That may be because it has a narrower orbit than PDS 70c, which is nearly as far from its star as Pluto is from the sun. That puts PDS 70c closer to an outer disk of debris surrounding the star.</p>

<p>“C is getting all the material from the outer disk, and b is getting starved,” says study coauthor Jaehan Bae, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>“In the past, b must have gotten some material in its [disk], and it could have already formed moons,” Bae says. But to make the new images, ALMA observed wavelengths of light emitted by sand-sized dust grains, not large objects, so those moons would not be visible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">Why the CDC says it’s crucial to start wearing masks indoors again</a></h4>

              
                <p>Delta has changed the course of the pandemic in the United States yet again.</p>



<p>After spurring a summer surge in COVID-19 cases, the more transmissible coronavirus variant is now driving federal health officials’ decision to recommend that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks again in indoor public places. That’s especially important in areas where infection rates are high, Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference July 27 to announce revised masking guidelines.</p>



<p>New evidence that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections of the delta variant produce just as much virus as infected, unvaccinated people prompted the new guidance. That suggests that these people may also easily spread the virus. “We have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you’re fully vaccinated,” Walensky said.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>Unvaccinated people should get vaccinated and wear masks in public indoor settings until fully vaccinated, she recommended. Additionally, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">fully vaccinated people in places with “high or substantial” transmission rates should also mask up</a> when indoors again. The CDC considers substantial transmission to be 50 to 100 cases out of every 100,000 people in the population over a seven-day period. Some places are reporting more than 300 cases per 100,000 people in a week, she said. “Really an extraordinary amount of viral transmission.” And everyone in schools should wear a mask, regardless of vaccination status, the CDC recommends.</p>



<p>This reverses the CDC’s May recommendation that fully vaccinated people could ditch the masks. That decision was based, in part, on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-mask-guideline-question-answer-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">low chance that vaccinated people could spread the virus</a> (<em>SN: 5/24/21</em>). If they do get a breakthrough infection, people vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines have about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107058">40 percent less virus</a> in their noses than infected, unvaccinated people do, researchers reported July 22 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. But that data was based on infections with earlier variants of the virus.</p>



<p>“The delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that causes COVID-19,” Walensky said. It’s “unlike the alpha variant we had back in May where we didn’t believe that if you were vaccinated you could transmit further.” In rare instances, fully vaccinated people may get infected with the delta variant and spread it to others, new data from several states and other countries shows, she said. The amount of virus vaccinated people with a delta variant breakthrough infection produce is similar to that of unvaccinated people, she said. “This new science is worrisome,” she said.</p>

</aside>



<p>The vaccines are still effective at preventing serious illness and death, studies have shown. Until the vast majority of people are vaccinated, “mask wearing will help reduce infections, prevent serious illnesses and death, limit strain on local hospitals and stave off the development of even more troubling variants, Barbara Alexander, an infectious diseases expert at Duke University School of Medicine and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.</p>



<p>The majority of transmission is still happening among and through unvaccinated people, Walensky said. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakthrough infections remain rare</a>, but exactly how rare they are with the delta variant isn’t known (<em>SN: 5/4/21</em>). The CDC collects data on breakthrough infections in hospitalized people, but not those who get infected but have mild cases. The public health agency is also actively testing more than 20 groups of vaccinated people for COVID-19, including tens of thousands of health care workers, essential workers and other caregivers. Results of that surveillance will be reported soon, Walensky said.</p>



<p>“It is not a welcome piece of news that masking is going to be a part of people’s lives who have already been vaccinated,” Walensky said. “This new data weighs heavily on me. This new guidance weighs heavily on me…  This was not a decision that was taken lightly.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/QxczBI6_0fY/">Extending support for preprint sharing</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS&rsquo; Director of Open Research Solutions</p>



<p>All PLOS journals welcome submission of papers that have been shared as preprints. PLOS was amongst the first publishers to adopt this policy, as we recognise the value in early sharing of community-curated research, a value borne out in the COVID pandemic.</p>



<p>As well as our permissive policy on preprints, we support preprint posting by authors by partnering with preprint services that are relevant to and adopted by a journal&rsquo;s community. To this end, PLOS&rsquo; new journals, which opened for submissions in May 2021, now welcome submissions directly from bioRxiv and/or medRxiv, two of the most widely adopted preprint servers for biology and medicine, respectively.</p>



<p>Bidirectional links between PLOS journal articles and preprints at bioRxiv and medRxiv also help assure readers of the credibility (trustworthiness) of preprints that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. This integration between preprint servers and journals saves authors time in submitting papers to PLOS journals. Authors do not need to reload manuscript files and re-enter author information at the journal. Researchers also increase their potential for peer feedback to improve their work. Preprint sharing is, also, an open research practice that has been<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/2/618/96153/The-relationship-between-bioRxiv-preprints"> associated with more readership and citations of peer-reviewed papers</a>.</p>



<p>The preprint server-to-journal relationships for the new PLOS journals are:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Receives submissions directly from bioRxiv</strong></td><td><strong>Receives submissions directly from medRxiv</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Climate</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Digital Health*</em></td><td>n/a</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Global Public Health*</em></td><td>n/a</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Water</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>*As a health research-focused journal, only medRxiv is applicable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As an early adopter of preprints, the proportion of published PLOS articles shared as a preprint is increasing year-on-year, with15% of articles published in PLOS journals so far in 2021 having an associated preprint. But adoption of preprints varies greatly by journal, discipline and region. More than 50% of research papers published in <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, for example, have associated preprints.</p>



<p>Support for sharing and receiving preprints is one of the numerous ways PLOS journals enable open science. All PLOS journals include a core set of open science policies and features, which include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Requiring</em> all data on which a paper&rsquo;s conclusions rely to be publicly accessible unless ethical restrictions apply</li><li><em>Encouraging</em> sharing of detailed, step-by-step protocols, on protocols.io</li><li><em>Encouraging</em> all authors and peer reviewers to opt in to open, published peer review</li></ul>



<p>Some journals offer enhanced open science policies or features, where a community of researchers has demonstrated a need for a different approach. <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s introduction of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">mandatory code sharing policy</a>,<em> PLOS Biology</em>&rsquo;s introduction of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/what-we-publish">Preregistered Research Articles</a>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s offering of <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">peer-reviewed protocols</a> and <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2021/03/30/registered-reports-one-year-at-plos-one/">Registered Reports</a> are examples.</p>



<p>As well as integrating new PLOS journals with relevant preprint services, we are working with our Editors and their communities to understand their needs and challenges around open science, and to explore future opportunities for new open research solutions (policies, tools, partnerships and features).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/27/some-teenagers-at-risk-of-self-harming-can-be-identified-a-decade-in-advance/">Some Teenagers At Risk Of Self-Harming Can Be Identified A Decade In Advance</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are multiple risk factors for self-harm, including a history of abuse, trauma, physical and mental illness, and bullying. Identifying these factors is a key part of prevention, ensuring that those at risk receive appropriate support as early as possible — but despite this, predicting who may end up engaging in self-harming behaviour is still tricky.     </p>



<p>But we may be able to identify these risks earlier than we thought, a <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(21)00219-7/fulltext">new study</a> from a University of Cambridge team suggests. Stepheni Uh and colleagues report that some at-risk adolescents could be identified ten years before they self-harm — offering what the team says is an “extended window” during which help and support can be offered.</p>



<span id="more-43031"></span>



<p>Participants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the experiences of young people in the UK; data has been gathered since participants were nine months old. At age 14, they had indicated whether they’d engaged in self-harming behaviour, and completed a questionnaire about depressive feelings and behaviours. At various points throughout their childhood, their caregivers had also completed a questionnaire about the child’s mental and physical health, self-esteem, sleep, their home environment, the quality of their friendships and any adverse experiences including bullying.</p>



<p>The team then used a neural network to identify the risk factors for self-harming among their participants. This also examined whether there were any distinct subgroups who had different characteristics or risk factors.</p>



<p>Two profiles emerged. The first set of children had a long-term history of poor mental health, which was apparent as early as five years old, and were more likely to have caregivers who had their own mental health issues. This group was also more likely to have experienced bullying before they began to harm themselves, and faced other problems in their home life.</p>



<p>For this group, then, risk factors for self-harm were evident up to ten years before the first incident. The findings could allow for the development of interventions that target those at risk of self-harm far earlier than is currently the case. Work on child and adolescent mental health strongly suggests that early intervention is key: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190740919314513">developing trauma-informed environments</a>, anti-bullying measures, exercises to boost self-esteem, support for those dealing with parental illness, and, crucially, well-funded mental health services, could therefore go some way to prevent further harm.</p>



<p>However, the second, larger, group did not show the same long-term risk factors. Instead this group was characterised by impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours which developed during teenage years. They also tended to feel less secure with friends and family.</p>



<p>Because teens who fit this profile did not show the same risk factors in childhood, they may be harder to identify. But the research still provides potential ways of helping these at-risk young people too, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/teenagers-at-greatest-risk-of-self-harming-could-be-identified-almost-a-decade-earlier">co-author Duncan Astle says</a>. “Given that they experience difficulties with their peers and are more willing to engage in risky behaviours, then providing access to self-help and problem-solving or conflict regulation programmes may be effective.”</p>



<p>Crucially, the study shows that those who self-harm are not a homogenous group: there are many complex risk factors associated with self-harm that interact with other life experiences, personality and more. Early responses and interventions should therefore be tailored to these individual differences rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/anole-lizards-breathe-underwater-air-bubble-snout">How some lizards breathe underwater</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some anole lizards have a newfound superpower: They can breathe underwater by trapping air in a bubble on their snouts. What’s more, these reptiles can stay submerged for nearly 20 minutes by rebreathing exhaled air in the bubble, a new study shows.</p>



<p>“As anyone who has encountered one of these lizards can tell you, they dive underwater when they feel threatened,” says&nbsp;evolutionary biologist Chris Boccia of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. But how the lizards stay underwater for so long had been a mystery until now.</p>



<p>Boccia was inspired to investigate by a story one of his professors told him when he was a student at the University of Toronto. In 2009, evolutionary biologist Luke Mahler had been studying an endangered species of <em>Anolis</em> lizard in Haiti. After releasing a lizard back into a clear, shallow stream, Mahler noticed something odd. As the animal clung to the rocky bottom, it exhaled an air bubble on its snout and appeared to repeatedly suck the air in and out of the bubble. Mahler had to move on to his next research site so he couldn’t explore more. But years later, he still remembered the bubble-headed lizard.</p>



<p>Boccia and colleagues traveled to Costa Rica in 2017 in search of bubble-headed anoles, capturing the creatures at night. “Doing this when they’re sleeping makes things less stressful for them,” Boccia says. It’s also “easier for us to catch them.”</p>





<p>Wearing head lamps to find the lizards in the dark, the researchers collected 300 anoles representing a range of species — 120 lizards were found near streams and 180 were found away from streams. Back at their camp, Boccia and colleagues gently dunked each lizard in containers of river water.</p>



<p>While underwater, all of the anoles carried a bubble of air around their snouts and appeared to breathe the bubble in and out. But river-based lizards <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/issue?pii=S0960-9822(20)X0014-5">rebreathed more often and stayed submerged longer</a> than their land-based relatives, Boccia, Mahler and colleagues report in the July 12 <em>Current Biology.</em></p>



<p>“One lizard was underwater for 18 minutes,” Boccia says. “We were starting to get worried about him.”</p>

Boccia</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Anoles’ water-repelling skin might play a role in forming the bubbles. As the reptile dives into the water, a thin layer of air may get trapped against that skin. When the lizard exhales, air exits through the nostrils and expands the trapped air layer. In that way, the lizard might use its lungs to control the bubble’s size.</p>



<p>If a lizard rebreathed the air in those bubbles, then the bubbles’ oxygen levels should drop over time. Inserting a small oxygen sensor into bubbles around submerged lizards’ snouts confirmed that the oxygen levels slowly dropped as the lizards breathed.</p>



<p>To stay submerged for long periods, the anoles may slow down their metabolism, reducing the need for oxygen, Boccia suspects. And as oxygen levels in the bubble drop and CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, the bubble may rebalance the levels by shedding CO<sub>2</sub> into the water and uptaking dissolved oxygen, he says.</p>



<p>The findings highlight how different animals have evolved to live in water, says evolutionary biologist Jonathan Losos of Washington University in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the research. “Species that experience the same challenge in nature often find different ways to overcome it,” Losos says. “Fish use gills to extract oxygen from the water. Whales are able to hold their breath for a long time. And now we know that these lizards take oxygen underwater with them.”</p>



<p>Both Boccia and Mahler hope to continue studying this newfound behavior. “There are so many different types of lizards, there is a good chance that others do it too,” Boccia says. “We just haven’t seen it.”</p>
