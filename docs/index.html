<p>"Do we still need libraries on our campuses? Isn't our information ecosystem -- the way we share scholarly knowledge -- working just fine, now that we have the internet? The perspective of this talk is that academic libraries need to boldly step up, in the name of social justice and fairness, to re-design a broken information ecosystem, and that the IITGN library can be a leader in this process. Faculty and students will be key change agents as we collectively transform the ecosystem through which we share human knowledge."</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/07/qa-with-li-cor/">Q&amp;A with LI-COR</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gursatya/"><b>Guru Singh</b></a><b>, Director of Scientific Content of Science Exchange, recently spoke with Jim Wiley, Director of Marketing, Biotechnology at </b><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/li-cor-biosciences"><b>LI-COR Biosciences</b></a><b>. Follow the interview below.</b></p>
<p><b>What should Science Exchange users know about LI-COR?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to making research reproducible. To illustrate, LI-COR is the only company that has developed methods required by journals and funding agencies to ensure that the Western blot data submitter is ready to produce robust and replicable data. We are also the only company in the Western blot market to deliver training materials/courses to educate the researcher on the above methods. These are available in the new LI-COR Lambda U<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> learning portal. Also, our Custom Services group can provide exploratory/confirmatory Western blot services and antibody validation services, which relate to journal requirements and ensure research reproducibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as important, LI-COR has expertise in IRDye® products (IRDye infrared fluorescent dyes) used for surgical, therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. There are over 20 ongoing clinical trials that have propelled the use of these dyes. Unlike other life science companies, we have the products, tools, and services that can successfully help researchers take their ‘probe’ from benchtop to clinic. Custom services also include probe labeling, probe validation, and probe manufacturing (non-cGMP and cGMP).</span></p>
<p><b>What makes your offerings unique?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only LI-COR has developed the full solution that includes products, tools, and services to set researchers up for success in delivering the most accurate, robust, and replicable Western blot data. Innovation was required to define and develop new protocols; there was no precise definition of how to calculate ‘replicates’ for Western blotting. LI-COR worked with the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) to create a definition (and later a protocol) that will now be enforced.</span></p>
<p><b>What are your primary proprietary technologies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our proprietary technologies include the Odyssey® Imager, IRDye infrared dyes, and the related methods/protocols developed to match the journals’ and funding agencies’ stringent data creation/submission requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>How is your molecular imaging superior to the chemiluminescent-based detection?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are limitations to film and visible fluorescent detection methods that make them very difficult to hit all the requirements. One example is the requirement that one must prove that their target and normalization signal are both in the same linear range of detection. This is straight-forward when using LI-COR products.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me about your global presence.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LI-COR Biotechnology products are supported globally by a network of distributors and are used in more than 100 countries. We sell directly to the US, Canada, and 11 European countries.</span></p>
<p><b>Interesting. How big is your company? (e.g., number of employees, funding status, etc.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LI-COR has been in business for over 45 years and currently consists of 300 employees. Since LI-COR is a private company, we cannot comment on our funding status.</span></p>
<p><b>What type of certifications does your company have? (e.g., GxP, minority-owned, women-owned, etc.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.</span></p>
<p><b>How is your technology different than that of your competitors?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not just one technology that separates LI-COR from the competition, but that we offer the complete package of products (imagers, software, and reagents), tools (protocols and educational materials), and services (training from expert scientists and customer services). These were developed to aid researchers in getting the best data possible, all in alignment with the new publisher requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Whom do you serve? What does your current client base look like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We serve researchers that utilize Western blots or are involved in probe development in their research in all markets including academia, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, and government agencies.</span></p>
<p><b>How has your partnership with Science Exchange been?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are inspired by Science Exchange’s mission to drive science forward by matching the research needs of scientists with the best solution providers. Science Exchange has been a terrific partner for introducing LI-COR to researchers who are looking for what LI-COR experts can offer through our Custom Services group.</span></p>
<p><b>Before we wrap up, do you have any final message to Science Exchange users?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of LI-COR’s over 20 years of experience in quantitative Western blotting and infrared dye applications. Our scientific experts have developed the methods and protocols that you need to successfully create the best data possible. If you need custom services and/or manufacturing, LI-COR scientists will partner with you to deliver the best results possible.</span></p>

<p>"This website is aimed to provide information about our MOOC on Open Science principles and practices, its rationale, the current state of the project, and the people behind it.</p>

<p>This project was started in early 2017 after a barcamp at the Open Science Conference in Berlin. Soon, more than 30 people contributed and a first draft was made. Now in late summer 2017, already more than 100 volunteers have agreed to share their knowledge about Open Science and to contribute to what they see as an extremely important issue in nowadays and future science. Concomitantly, the European Commission published its report “Providing researchers with the skills and competencies they need to practise Open Science”, supporting the importance of the topic and thereby the necessity to explain, teach and support researchers to gain the necessary skills."</p>

<p>Individuals suffering from prostate or breast cancer can experience symptoms such as emotional distress, fatigue and sleep difficulties resulting in a decrease in their quality of life. While previous studies have identified the benefits of hypnosis and other group interventions in reducing fatigue and emotional distress in breast cancer patients, a study by Grégoire <em>et al. </em>published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> sought to identify whether these types of interventions would also be beneficial to prostate cancer patients.</p>
<p>The study assessed 25 men with prostate cancer and 68 women with breast cancer before and after a self-hypnosis/self-care group intervention. The researchers then analyzed the impact this group intervention had on the patients’ quality of life, sleep difficulties and fatigue.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results of the study showed that, whilst the female breast cancer group experienced positive effects of the intervention on various symptoms including depression, anxiety and fatigue, the male prostate cancer group reported no effect. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the greater difficulties and different cancer treatments the breast cancer group experienced prior to the intervention compared to the prostate cancer group. The male prostate cancer group also reported few problems with distress, sleep or fatigue prior to the intervention, which may have contributed to the lack of reported improvement on these symptoms.</p>

<p>A study by Darlow <em>et al.</em>, published in <em>BMC Rheumatology</em>, investigates the beliefs that patients with knee osteoarthritis have the disease, as well as how these beliefs are formed and the impact they have on participating in activity, self-management and health behavior. Thirteen individuals from New Zealand with knee osteoarthritis were interviewed.</p>
<p>The study found that patients were often uncertain of how to interpret their daily symptoms, and what they can do to influence the rate of decline. This resulted in patients believing that joint replacement is the only effective option available to them. Ultimately, misunderstandings about knee osteoarthritis led to a negative impact on the individuals’ participation in activity, their health behaviors and their self-management.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that improving the provision of information to those with knee osteoarthritis may help guide positive health behavior and self-management decisions.</p>

Previous studies have investigated the link between differing lengths of sleep duration and various diseases such as obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>In a study published by <em>BMC Public Health</em>, Kim et al. studied the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome in Koreans aged 40-69 years old. This cross-sectional study analyzed the data of over 130,000 individuals from the years 2004-2013. Sleep categories assessed were less than 6 hours, 6 to less than 8 hours, 8 to less than 10 hours and at least 10 hours.</p>
<p>The researchers found that less than 6 hours of sleep a day was associated with metabolic syndrome in men, and elevated waist circumference in men and women. More than 10 hours of sleep was associated with elevated waist circumference, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated fasting glucose in women, whereas elevated triglycerides and metabolic syndrome were associated with more than 10 hours sleep in both men and women.</p>

<p>Two new BMC journals opened for submissions in June. <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> will focus on the combination of tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with the ultimate goal of improving human health. <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em> will encompass the production of, use, transformation, transportation and reuse of chemicals, biochemicals, materials and energy.</p>
<p>Both journals are now open for submissions, and many more journals will soon be launched to expand the scope of the BMC series beyond biology and medicine and into engineering. Both journals are open access and peer reviewed, and neither makes editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. The first articles will be published in November 2018.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine:</em> <a href="https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-018-0672-y">Earlier smoking after waking and the risk of asthma</a></strong><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10354" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/cigarette-3022376_960_720-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></strong></p>
<p>Research conducted by Arielle Selya, Sunita Thapa and Guarav Mehta investigated whether smoking within 5 minutes of waking up (an indicator of nicotine dependence) was independently associated with asthma. Outcomes of asthma assessed included lifetime asthma, past-year asthma, and having had an asthma attack in the past year.</p>
<p>The researchers found that smoking within 5 minutes of waking up was associated with an approximately 50% increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma and past-year asthma retrospectively. It was also associated with a 4 times increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma. These findings may be used in order to refine the risk assessments of asthma among smokers.</p>

In a paper published by <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em>, Butler-Laporte <em>et al.</em> assess whether a score based on patient factors and MRSA colonization is able to predict the risk of MRSA infection in cases of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, to inform the need for empiric coverage.<p></p>
<p>The researchers found that MRSA colonization surpassed all other factors to be the only reliable and independent predictor of MRSA infection. Further patient diseases or disorders were not adequate predictors of MRSA colonization. The study results indicate that a clinical approach based on a patient’s known MRSA colonization status and on local susceptibility patterns may be appropriate.</p>

In a paper published by <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em>, Yoshizawa <em>et al. </em>used this species as a model to study the genetic mechanisms which underlie ASD.<p></p>
<p>Although the researchers do not believe the behaviors between humans and fish are at the same levels of complexity, their findings do suggest that the behaviors in both species are evolutionarily conserved. The study surveyed genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor between cavefish and humans and similarities were identified. They also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage, finding that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. The study concludes that the evolution of humans and fish share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.</p>

<p>People who’ve had an out-of-body experience (OBE) report that their conscious awareness shifted outside their physical body – often upwards, so they felt like they were floating above their own head. It’s thought that OBEs occur when the brain fails to properly integrate data from the different senses, including vision, touch, proprioception (the sense of where the limbs and other body parts are located in space) and from the vestibular system (organs in the inner ear that monitor head orientation, balance and motion).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Previous research has mostly focused on the role of vision and touch – for example by triggering the illusion of viewing one’s own body – but the vestibular system has largely been neglected. If it does play an important role we should expect that problems with the vestibular system – which often present as feelings of dizziness – lead to OBEs, but do they? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Historical case studies suggested that they might. And now, published in <em>Cortex</em>, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669509">first systematic study</a> of patients referred to a neurological specialist because of dizziness has found that they can.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34162"></span></p>
<p>Christophe Lopez, a neuroscientist at Aix Marseille University, and Maya Elziere, a neurologist specialising in balance disorders at the Hôpital Européen, also in Marseille, France, compared 210 patients referred to them for dizziness and vertigo (having the feeling of spinning, swaying or tilting, being off balance, or that the room is spinning) with the same number of age and gender-matched controls. They found that the patients were much more likely to report having had an OBE – 14 per cent had had at least one, compared with 5 per cent of the healthy controls. And most of these patients reported having an OBE only after their dizziness had started.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>During their OBE, most of the patients reported vestibular sensations – of elevation and lightness, for example. (One reported a “sensation of entering my body, like in an envelope, from the top”). The vast majority of these patients also reported having had not just one but multiple OBEs, which usually lasted for a few seconds or a few minutes.</p>
<p>OBEs were linked mainly to dizziness caused by obvious problems with the vestibular system itself such as vestibular neuritis and Meniere’s disease (rather than being brain-based). Yet, most patients with these same vestibular problems did not develop OBEs so something else must be going on to contribute to the experience. Questionnaire results showed that scores for “depersonalisation-derealization”, depression and anxiety, were the main predictors of OBE in patients with dizziness, suggesting these psychological factors interact with the physical problem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>of atypical signals being sent from the vestibular system to generate OBEs. In healthy controls, there was also a relationship between depersonalisation-derealization scores and reported OBEs. This isn’t a surprise: depersonalisation-derealization involves feelings of observing yourself from outside your body, or having the sense that things around you aren’t real.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As anxiety was also a significant predictor – and anxiety is known to be linked to vertigo – “we suggest that anxiety and depersonalisation-derealization may combine to precipitate OBE in patients with dizziness,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>As well as their cost-saving appeal, the rationale for large open-plan offices is that they are expected to act as a crucible for human chemistry, increasing face-to-face encounters between colleagues to the benefit of creativity and collaboration. Unfortunately it’s well-established that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/">most workers don’t like them</a>, such is the fundamental human need for privacy and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/27/why-its-important-that-employers-let-staff-personalise-their-workspaces/">control over one’s environment</a>. Now <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239">a pair of quasi-experimental field studies</a> published in <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em> suggest that the supposed collaborative advantage of open-plan offices also doesn’t pass muster.</p>
<p><span id="more-34170"></span></p>
<p>Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, at Harvard Business School and Harvard University, respectively, recruited 52 employees at the global headquarters of a Fortune 500 multinational company that was about to undergo a redesign of an entire floor, stripping out the individual cubicles to create a fully open-plan workspace.</p>
<p>The participants, whose roles included sales, technology and human resources, wore a “sociometric badge” and microphone for three weeks prior to the redesign. Then a couple of months after the office refit, they wore the badge and microphone again for another three weeks.</p>
<p>The bluetooth-enabled electronic badges and the microphones allowed the researchers to monitor the frequency of the employees’ face-to-face interactions. The company also granted access to their servers so the researchers could look for any changes in use of email and instant messenger.</p>
<p>The results were stark: after the shift to an open-plan office space, the participants spent 73 per cent less time in face-to-face interactions, while their use of email and instant messenger shot up by 67 per cent and 75 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>A second study involving 100 employees at another Fortune 500 company was similar but this time the researchers monitored changes to the nature of the interactions between specific pairs of colleagues before the shift to an open-plan office compared with afterwards.</p>
<p>There were 1830 interacting dyads and, of these, 643 reduced their amount of face-to-face interaction after the workspace became open-plan, compared with just 141 showing more physical interaction. Overall, face-to-face time decreased by around 70 per cent across the participating employees, on average, with email use increasing by between 22 per cent and 50 per cent (depending on the estimation method used).</p>
<p>If you’ve ever sought refuge from the gold-fish bowl of an open-plan office environment by cocooning yourself with headphones, or if you’ve decided you’d rather not have that challenging conversation with a colleague in front of a large group of your peers, and opted to email them instead, then these findings will come as little surprise.</p>
<p>However, while a great deal of research has established <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/">employees’ negative feelings about open-plan offices</a>, both in terms of lost privacy and adverse effects on communication, this is the first study to provide an objective measure of the impact of an open-plan space on how people interact.</p>
<p>The real-life setting of this research is a major advantage but it does of course come at the expense of full experimental control and it remains a possibility that other factors, besides the office design change, may explain the results. The researchers did attempt to mitigate this possibility, such as by allowing time for the employees to settle into the new office design before resuming data collection.</p>
<p>“While it is possible to bring chemical substances together under specific conditions of temperature and pressure to form the desired compound, more factors seem to be at work in achieving a similar effect with humans,” the researchers said. “Until we understand those factors, we may be surprised to find a reduction in face-to-face collaboration at work even as we architect transparent, open spaces intended to increase it.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/07/05/solve-problem-palaeoproteomics/">How do you solve a problem in palaeoproteomics?</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/chimp-e1530716663298-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Palaeoproteomics – Exciting new frontiers</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/research/current-projects/former-research/palaeoproteomics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palaeoproteomics</a> is the new-kid-on-the-block in archaeological science and evolutionary biology. <a href="http://www.shh.mpg.de/878736/protein-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Standards</a> of practice have only recently been set out for this burgeoning field of investigation, used recently to study ancient <a href="https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/pondering-the-possibilities-of-proteomics.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">humans</a>, <a href="https://www.spectroscopyasia.com/article/zooms-collagen-barcode-and-fingerprints" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animals</a>, and even <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5822/277">dinosaurs</a> (though this is somewhat disputed).</p>
<p>Ancient protein sequences are incredibly robust compared to ancient DNA, with proteins recently retrieved from samples as old as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/oldest-ever-proteins-extracted-38-million-year-old-ostrich-shells">3.8 million years</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Bioinformatics techniques</strong></h3>
<p>Single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), areas in the proteome where one amino acid (AA) difference occurs, are useful to determine evolutionary differences between clades, including late Pleistocene hominins like Neanderthals and <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/denisovan/">Denisovans</a>.</p>
<p>Error-tolerant searches (wherein the algorithm can ‘learn’ when examples received have been corrupted in some way) correctly inferred SAPs in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14249">Collagen Type 1</a> of modern and Pleistocene samples, but as Dr Welker notes, this “needs to be demonstrated [in a whole proteome] before moving on to the analysis of older and possibly more divergent hominin fossils”. This is the basis of the experiments reported in his <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1141-1">recently-published paper in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The cross-species proteomics effect problem</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>As you go further back in time on the evolutionary tree, larger proteomic sequence differences occur between your target species and their more-distant relatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until now, the cross-species proteomics effect (CSPE) problem hadn’t been demonstrated to be overcome by error-tolerant searches – essential for confidence in palaeoproteomic investigations.</p>
<p>The CSPE problem derives from using a different reference proteome from your target population or species. As you go further back in time on the evolutionary tree, larger proteomic sequence differences occur between your target species and their more-distant relatives.</p>
<p>The larger the number of sequence differences, the more likely that peptides and proteins will not be identified in standard (non-error-tolerant) searches. The small proteome databases available for hominin species compound the effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Error-tolerant vs Standard search experiment</strong></h3>
<p>Error-tolerant searches should allow for identification of SAPs, and overcome the CSPE issue. Dr Welker tested this using standard and error-tolerant searches of the proteomes of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873800/">7 modern human samples</a> against UniProt-derived human (<em>Homo sapiens; </em>‘<em>Homo s.’</em>), chimpanzee (<em>Pan troglodytes; </em>‘<em>Pan</em>’), and Sumatran orang-utan (<em>Pongo abelii; </em>‘<em>Pongo</em>’) reference databases using <a href="http://www.bioinfor.com/">PEAKS</a> (v 7.5).</p>
<p>For a protein to be confirmed, at least two unique <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/msproteomics/tag/psm/">peptide spectrum matches</a> (PSMs) with a FDR (false discovery rate) of 1% had to be identified when searching the modern samples against the <em>Homo s. </em>database in the general search. In error-tolerant searches, PSMs were accepted only when a peptide of 10 amino acids (AAs) or longer was matched in the <em>Homo s. </em>database.</p>
<p>Four outcomes were established for PSMs individually searched against orthologous databases in error-tolerant searches, and two outcomes in standard searches, viewable in Figure 1 in Dr Welker’s paper.</p>
<h3><strong>Evolutionary distance, and long peptides</strong></h3>
<p>No PSMs with three or more SAPs were identified, and mutable PSMs with AA lengths over 25 were almost never identified (Figure 4 in Dr Welker’s article). Mutable PSMs with 10-15 AAs were identified up to 75% of the time, regardless of evolutionary distance.</p>
<p>This could be problematic when comparing human proteomes with much older hominin ancestors – larger evolutionary distances may make it difficult to reliably reconstruct <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/building-an-evolutionary-tree">phylogenetic trees</a>.</p>
<p>Welker recommends creating shorter peptides in palaeoproteomic studies, and searching against databases of species with less evolutionary distance, though the latter may more difficult with more ancient hominins.</p>
<p>Error-tolerant searches minimised the CSPE problem between moderately divergent proteomes (e.g. the human-chimpanzee split), and this should be kept in mind for future phylogenetic analysis of ancient hominin proteomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Filtering criteria to mitigate falsely-suggested AA substitutions</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Fast-evolving proteins provide more phylogenetic information compared to slow-evolving proteins, but their high substitution rates mean they may go unidentified in error-tolerant searches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Error-tolerant searches can miss-match PSMs, incorrectly suggesting PSMs that should not be mutated, confounding phylogenetic analysis. Welker determined filtering criteria to mitigate these off-target effects in error-tolerant searches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two or more PSMs covering the mutated AA position must be confirmed.</li>
<li>These PSMs must comprise the majority of the total number of PSMs matching that AA position.</li>
</ol>
<p>These filtering criteria remove falsely-suggested AA substitutions, but can filter out correctly-substituted PSMs matching a single PSM, which could affect phylogeneticically-informative PSMs. Welker suggests running the same protein extract several times on a tandem mass spectrometer.</p>
<h3><strong>Informative proteins a potential target for phylogenetic studies</strong></h3>
<p>Fast-evolving proteins provide more phylogenetic information compared to slow-evolving proteins, but their high substitution rates mean they may go unidentified in error-tolerant searches. Welker revealed two fast-evolving proteins, with phylogenetically-informative positions sufficiently spaced to allow error-tolerant search identification, even at large evolutionary distances.</p>
<p>Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (<em>AHSG</em>) and fibrinogen alpha chain (<em>FGA</em>), frequently observed in ancient bone proteome datasets, present a viable target for proteomic phylogenetic studies.</p>
<h3><strong>Filling in the map</strong></h3>
<p>While there are limitations to error-tolerant searches in palaeoproteomic studies, Frido Welker has established filtering criteria and recommended experimental techniques to help maximise the potential for whole proteome investigations. Moreover, he has identified two potentially invaluable proteins for evolutionary studies.</p>
<p>Palaeoproteomics is a new field of study, with much of its potential and limitations still to be explored. Dr Welker’s paper has filled in a portion of the map of this largely-uncharted territory.</p>

<h4>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience release open source software, connecting and building the neuroscience coding community.</h4>
<p>Is it possible for microscopes to learn a bit about the brain? Even be taught by neuroscientists to reliably recognize parts of brain cells… all on their own? Though it may seem like something straight out of “The Jetsons”, a neuroscientist and software engineer in the lab of MPFI’s Scientific Director, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, Ph.D., is developing new software with the goal of vastly improving the daily life of a microscope user. Combining a specialized algorithm, aptly named a neural network with a small amount of training, microscopes can now autonomously and efficiently identify small neuronal compartments called dendritic spines with over 90% accuracy. Just like Rosie the robotic maid, microscopes equipped with this Spine Identification software are helping scientists streamline their daily routine, bringing research one step into the future.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion and advancement in powerful imaging technologies, capable of taking a look inside the brain with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. From imaging technology alone, neuroscientists have gained an immense wealth of new information about the brain. But despite many advances in implementation and capabilities, powerful microscopes (and the software running them) are still lacking when it comes to ease of use and overall user experience.</p>
<p>In a new study published in PLOS ONE, Dr. Michael Smirnov, Ph.D., has created an imaging software he hopes will craft a new type of experience for users.</p>
<p>Smirnov explains that “When engineers and scientists design cutting-edge microscopes, they usually focus on the actual physical components and design. They are mostly interested in what these imaging technologies can do, what boundaries they can break and how they perform. Far less attention is placed on how these complex technologies can be made accessible for the average user and really improve their workflow. Each time I write my software, I always think about the user first; how can I make a difference for the person using it, make their research a little easier.”</p>
<p>The Yasuda lab studies the complex process called synaptic plasticity, which is thought to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. When single dendritic spines are stimulated, hundreds of signaling molecules are mobilized to carry new information throughout the neuron. Members of the lab investigate this process in detail utilizing 2-photon microscopy, hoping to glean insights into how the interplay of these molecules translates into memory.</p>
<p>Live 2-photon imaging experiments can be an intensive endeavor. Scientists must patiently sift through a neuron’s dendritic arbor, scanning hundreds of spines for suitable candidates to image. Experiments are frequently repeated to amass sufficient data and those that fail mid-way must be restarted. This often unspoken aspect can quickly turn prolonged imaging into a tedious and time consuming chore, ultimately slowing scientific progress.</p>
<p>Dr. Smirnov’s software aims to rescue neuroscientists from the humdrum of spine imaging. Weaving in an element of machine learning, the algorithm can be taught how to differentiate between dendrite backbone and dendritic spines after being fed a training data set of previously identified spines. Once the training period finishes, the software is capable of automatedly scanning through an image and demarcating spines it comes across with high precision. Unlike previously developed programs which can be computing intensive or optimized only for post imaging analysis, Smirnov’s software is fast, scalable and compatible with most live imaging setups and post analysis applications.</p>
<p>“We incorporated a machine learning approach, because we wanted our software to be flexible, adaptable and as easy to use as possible.” Says Smirnov “The program only requires the user to input an image and specify the scale. After that, the program does the rest.”</p>
<p>Smirnov describes that by automating the process of spine identification, the software has the potential to dramatically increase experiment workflow, shaving off hours of time. In addition, he has also made his program’s code readily available to the broader neuroscience community. A move he hopes will engage the community of coders working in the field and give them the ability to freely improve upon and customize the software, making it useful for wider applications.</p>
<p>Dr. Smirnov notes that Scientists at MPFI are not only committed to conducting high caliber basic neuroscience research, but also look for ways to continuously improve the research process; fast tracking new discoveries and positively impacting scientists’ daily lives.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Hawaiian Islands are the home of some of the most spectacular events of massive diversification.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is particularly true when the component islands are arranged chronologically, as is found in “hotspot” islands that form a geological age gradient representing snapshots of biodiversity assembly through evolutionary time. Such islands provide simple and discrete systems, of known age and varying area, allowing them to serve as excellent “natural laboratories” for understanding the evolution of life under supreme isolation.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Islands in particular are the home of some of the most spectacular events of massive diversification. More than a thousand species of <em>Drosphila</em> fruit files, tens of Honeycreepers and a vast variety of lobelioids plants, just to mention a few. All of them are examples of adaptive radiation.</p>
<p>Adaptive radiation is the evolutionary process by which a single ancestor can rapidly give rise to many species that diversify along different ecological axes. But, how does it happen? While many studies have examined the rate of diversification and patterns of ecological shifts, the missing element has always been the initial steps: How does a single species diverge ecologically in a way that allows it to co-occur in exactly the same site as its parent species?</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://rdcu.be/000q">recently published paper</a> at<em> BMC Evolutionary Biology</em> we examined this question by analyzing the population genetics of closely related species from an adaptive radiation of Hawaiian spiders in the long jawed genus <em>Tetragnatha</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10288" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10288 size-large" height="428" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig3_Cotoras-1024x685.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Native Hawaiian forest at Puʻu Kukuʻi on West Maui</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Different species in this genus have been characterized by their color – whether <em>Green</em>, <em>Maroon</em>, <em>Small Brown</em> or <em>Large Brown</em> – and the substrates upon which they find refuge during the day (green leaves versus maroon mosses, brown twigs, or branches).</p>
<p>Given the exclusively nocturnal behavior of the spiders and their very limited visual capacity, diurnal predation is the most likely selective pressure responsible for the close color matching. The most likely predators are honeycreepers for which spiders can form an important component of the diet.</p>
<p>Within the radiation, species have tended to colonize from older to younger islands and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anolis_ecomorphs">ecomorphs</a> have arisen partly through <em>in situ</em> diversification producing closely related species of different ecomorph; and between-island colonization in which species pre-adapted to each of the niches arrive from older islands and subsequently differentiate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation">allopatry</a> without change in ecomorph.</p>
<p>The specific question we asked was, given that populations likely start diverging in allopatry without any change in ecomorph, at what stage do they come back together and interact in sympatry?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10287" style="width: 220px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10287" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig2_Cotoras-210x300.jpg" width="210" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Male <em>Tetragnatha brevignatha</em> under a leaf on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>By focusing on close relatives of species of the same ecomorph that occur on the youngest islands of the Hawaiian chain, we were able to elucidate the initial stages of the process of adaptive radiation.</p>
<p>Major results were, first, that populations of the same species are highly structured, indicating that the first axis of separation between populations is likely allopatric. Second, we found that, within the focal set of taxa, genetically divergent lineages co-occur without evidence of hybridization.</p>
<p>This situation suggests that these genetically divergent lineages had already developed reproductive isolation when they came into secondary contact, yet this occurred prior to ecological divergence.</p>
<p>This contrasts what we find on older islands, where sister species are ecologically different (separate ecomorphs). Therefore, this study highlights a key period in the process of adaptive radiation when divergent and genetically separated taxa within the same ecomorph have the opportunity to interact.</p>

<p>If you are with someone who is ignoring you while they interact with their smartphone, you have been phone snubbed, or “phubbed”. Phubbing is common, at least in Western cultures – in a recent US survey, nine out of ten respondents said they had used their smartphone during their most recent social activity. There’s also evidence that it is socially harmful, leaving people less satisfied with their face-to-face interactions and generating feelings of resentment and jealousy. Now the <i>Journal of Applied Social Psychology </i>has published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12506?campaign=wolearlyview">a new study</a> exploring the reasons for these effects.</p>
<p><span id="more-34136"></span></p>
<p>The paper is based on PhD research by Varoth Chotpitayasunondh at the University of Kent, who, together with co-author Karen Douglas, asked mostly female student participants (average age 19) to watch a three-minute animation in which cartoon figures interacted and exchanged utterances that could not be heard but could be detected through mouth movements. Participants had to imagine themselves as the closest figure in the video and afterward make judgments about the conversation and how they felt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In one condition, the participants’ conversation partner’s phone remained unused on the table throughout the conversation. In another version, their partner’s attention was quickly drawn to something on their phone and they spent the rest of the interaction phubbing, keeping their gaze on the screen as they periodically swiped it while smiling and chuckling at what they saw. A third condition involved the participants’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>partner engaging in bursts of phubbing interspersed with periods where they ignored their phone.</p>
<p>The 128 participants took a dim view of phubbing. The more it was present, the worse they considered both the quality of the interaction and the calibre of the relationship.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that phubbing has this effect because it is seen as form of social exclusion, analogous to when people have no choice but to eat alone at the school cafeteria or find that their friends don’t return their calls. The twist is that this exclusion occurs while sharing a physical encounter and, at least notionally, interacting – note that in the animations, the (unheard) conversation did not cease during phubbing.</p>
<p>Consistent with this account, Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas found that phubbing adversely affected participants’ fundamental needs, including their sense of belonging, need for meaning and self-esteem, just as is found for more traditional forms of social exclusion. The more phubbing threatened these needs (except meaning), the more the participants felt poorly about the interaction and the relationship, and this was true regardless of how typical and socially acceptable they considered phubbing to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas point out that evidence for their social exclusion explanation doesn’t prevent phubbing having an impact through other means, such as “norm violation” – feeling insulted by a partner’s incivil behaviour, and they suggest more research into such mechanisms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new findings elaborate our understanding of a subtle but ubiquitous aspect of our daily experience, one that can easily create vicious cycles of detachment, and leave even planned attempts to connect together as events where we remain partly absent.</p>

In this post, I'm not going to talk about the paper itself but rather, about how it came to be published and how preregistration - a concept I have long advocated - may be being misused.

The paper reports on five studies which all address the same general question. Of these, Study #3 was preregistered and the authors write that it was performed after

<p>What leads some people to tyrannise others, as when guards abuse their prisoners? The US psychologist Philip Zimbardo would say it’s the corrupting power of the situation. Infamously, in the summer of 1971, his prison simulation study had to be abandoned when some of the volunteers playing the role of guards began mistreating the volunteers acting as prisoners.</p>
<p>The shock value of the aborted study derives in large part from the idea that the mock prison took on a life of its own; that otherwise “ordinary” folk began behaving in abhorrent ways simply because they’d been assigned a role with particular connotations. As Zimbardo put it, the guards’ brutality occurred “as a natural consequence of being in the uniform of a ‘guard'”.</p>
<p>But not everyone buys this account. Critics of the Stanford Prison Experiment have long claimed that Zimbardo and his colleagues did not merely observe, but actively participated in the events that unfolded.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Alex Haslam at the University of Queensland has analysed a recently released recording of a conversation between one of the volunteer guards and Zimbardo’s collaborator David Jaffe, who acted as prison warden for the study. The findings of their analysis, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/b7crx/">released as a pre-print at PsyArXiv</a>, suggest that one of psychology’s most famous studies was not so much an experiment but more a form of theatre. “We can no longer airbrush out the role of the experimenters in producing brutality,” write Haslam et al.</p>
<p><span id="more-34147"></span></p>
<p>The conversation, <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050">available for anyone to listen to online</a> (starts from 8.38), is 18-minutes long and features Jaffe attempting to persuade the “guard” John Mark to behave more like a stereotypical tough guard, a role he is clearly reluctant to take on.</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues analysed the interaction specifically looking for evidence of whether Jaffe engaged in “identity leadership”, which is characterised by the leader creating a shared sense of identity (a “them” and “us” mentality) and painting the required behavior of the in-group (the “us”) as worthy and virtuous and beneficial to the in-group.</p>
<p>The researchers found multiple examples of Jaffe engaging in precisely these kind of leadership tactics – for instance, he uses the collective “we” 57 times in the conversation (or once every 30 words); he argues that the entire endeavor will fall apart unless Mark and the other volunteer guards behave as required; and he portrays this shared endeavour as worthy, as a way to increase the chance of real-life prison reform.</p>
<p>Indisputably, Jaffe does not sit back and allow Mark to choose freely how to behave in his assigned role of guard: “… [W]e really want to get you active and involved because the Guards have to know that every Guard is going to be what we call a tough Guard,” he tells Mark.</p>
<p>The newly analysed recording, together with earlier video footage of Zimbardo acting as “prison superintendent” and briefing the guards on what was expected of them, contradict the way that Zimbardo has portrayed the experiment, as if the unsettling events unfolded by themselves. It seems more accurate to view the Stanford Prison Experiment as a compelling example of semi-scripted improvised theatre rather than as objective scientific research. Hopefully such an interpretation will find its way through to our introductory textbooks, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">many of which present only Zimbardo’s account of what happened</a>.</p>
<p>But still, it remains the case that some of the volunteers assigned to the role of guards went way beyond the script, engaging in such cruel behaviour as forcing the “prisoners” to clean out toilets with their hands. How satisfactory is the social identity account that Haslam and his co-authors put forward as an explanation for why some of the guards resisted engaging in tyranny, while others willingly went way beyond Zimbardo and his colleagues’ expectations, not just acting tough, but engaging in depravity?</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues admit that to claim, on the basis of the new evidence, that identity leadership was responsible for the guards’ brutality “would be to go too far”.</p>
<p>Even while recognising the important influence of Zimbardo and his colleagues on the events that took place at Stanford (and why it was so persuasive), many will remain appalled by the sadism on display, and crave a deeper explanation for the darkness that resides within seemingly ordinary people. As science writer and sceptic Michael Shermer <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelshermer/status/1012005792164274177">wrote on Twitter</a> in response to these new findings and wider criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment, “The fact remains that the potential for evil lies in our nature given the right circumstances.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/DSC_0714-e1530177552947-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Universal health coverage (UHC) is a situation where every person irrespective of where they live and their socioeconomic status, have access to good quality health services without having to go through any financial hardship.</p>
<p>It has three key elements, namely: equity in access to healthcare in terms of geographic coverage and the range of available health services, health services which are of high quality, and financial protection against any hardship to users of health services which may be arise as a result of out-of-pocket payments.</p>
<p>UHC is central to the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of leaving no one behind. Its benefit goes beyond ensuring good health for populations; it also contributes to reduction in poverty, gender equity, social economic growth, and human capital development of any society.</p>
<blockquote><p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens. However, to many people, it may appear to be an ambitious target which would be difficult to achieve by many African countries.</p>
<p>Of course, as a public health physician with extensive working experience in Africa, I have witnessed first-hand the challenges in attaining UHC such as inadequate human resources for health, weak medicines supply chain management systems, inadequate and unsustainable financing of health services, and recurrent disasters which weakens health systems.</p>
<p>The high levels of poverty; poor status of the social; economic and environmental determinants of health; and the fact that a sizable majority of African citizens work in the informal sectors, making it difficult for them to participate in social protection and health insurance schemes, further compound the problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Achieving universal health coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Despite these challenges, I do strongly believe that attainment of UHC is a feasible aspiration which should be vigorously pursued by all African countries. The lessons learnt from implementation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_archive/2015wess_full_en.pdf">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> have shown that with strong political commitment and good governance, African countries could overcome the adversities which stand between them and UHC.</p>
<p>There are very good examples such as Rwanda; a country which was able to transform itself against all odds from the tragic events of 1994 to achieve all the health related MDGs. This enviable achievement was made possible by political commitment to health, good governance, accountable leadership, self-determination and use of innovations including a well acclaimed community-based health insurance program which covers more than 85% of its target population.</p>
<p>Similar but tailor-made methods could be used by other African countries to deploy innovative, cost-effective and context specific strategies and appropriate technologies to ensure sustainable financing of healthcare services, extension of health services to the populations which are underserved and to expand the range of health services.</p>
<blockquote><p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is therefore instructive that the first ever Africa Health Forum took place in Kigali Rwanda in June 2017. The forum in which I actively participated as an organizer and participant was convened to brainstorm on the key challenges and ways to fast track attainment of UHC in Africa and to galvanize commitment of African political leaders, civil society and the private sector to UHC and health SDG agenda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-12-supplement-7">report of the forum</a>, published in <em>BMC Proceedings</em>, provides insights into how UHC can be achieved in Africa. The participants and discussants at the forum proposed the use of evidence-based methods to advocate for sustainable domestic financing of health care services, institution of mandatory social protection and prepaid health insurance, and doubling of the efforts to generate good quality public health data.</p>
<p>The forum further identified increased private sector engagement in health services delivery and financing, strengthened partnerships, improved intersectoral collaborations and the use of south-south cooperation mechanisms as critical tools for fast tracking attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>
<p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health and to fast track deployment of new technologies, including digital health solutions to support the attainment of UHC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, UHC should be viewed as a high yield investment which would ultimately translate into a healthier and productive population which will in turn transform Africa socioeconomically thus its attainment should not be negotiable. Looking forward, use of innovative approaches and evidence are needed to boost the attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>

In 2015, in a small town in Germany called Handeloh, a group of 29 men and women were rushed to hospital after displaying strange and sometimes violent behaviours along with other symptoms including vomiting and seizures. The victims were all attendees at a seminar on spiritual healing called 'Die sieben Quellen' - "The Seven Springs".

The patients all survived, although a number were seriously ill. The organizer of seminar, a psychotherapist, admitted to police that he had given the attendee

<p>Our world is getting smaller and we are all getting farther apart.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t a prelude to a discussion on how technology has turned us into antisocial zombies. On the contrary, in an increasingly connected world each of us has more opportunities to work in, travel to, and meet people from different places around the globe than ever before. This means there are that many more of us <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/08/how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-examine-my-brain/">falling in love</a> with people who live far away from us—in different cities, countries, continents and, maybe one day, planets?</p>
<p>Alternatively, some of us have fallen in love with the girl/boy next door only to find ourselves separated from the love of our lives due to their/our work commitments. In any case, few of us are strangers to being a partner in a long-distance relationship (LDR).</p>
<p>While there is a healthy amount of research that looks into how couples communicate with each other within a relationship, there is, surprisingly, not that much about how couples in long-distance relationships keep the flame burning. </p>
<p>For many of us, LDRs are a ‘test’ to see how strong a relationship is and if it can sustain itself in the face of adversity. Sure, there was a time when the only means couples in an LDR had to stay in touch was through fortnightly letters written by hand or expensive phone calls with unclear network reception. But today, with a spectrum of communication mediums literally at our fingertips, this ‘test’ is not nearly as challenging as it once was.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by Hampton et al. (2018) the authors set out to find out which mediums were used the most by couples in LDRs and which were the most effective at maintaining relationship satisfaction. They had a straightforward hypothesis: couples in LDRs who communicated with each other more frequently would report greater relationship satisfaction. To this hypothesis they added a caveat: not all means of communication are created equal, and some, such as Skype, may be more <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/30/what-keeps-couples-together-for-the-duration/">beneficial to relationships</a> than others. </p>
<p>The researchers surveyed 588 participants in LDRs that asked them questions about how frequently they used different kinds of communication, how satisfied they were with the communication in their relationship, and how satisfied they were with their relationship overall. </p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, text messages were the most frequently used means of communication in LDRs. However, Skype was the only communication medium where the researchers could discern association with relationship satisfaction. Partners who spent more time video chatting via Skype did indeed report greater levels of satisfaction with their relationship. When it came to communication satisfaction, it was the use of Skype as well as picture messaging that came out on top. As for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/">Facebook</a>, Twitter, and Snapchat? They had close to no impact on either relationship or communication satisfaction. In fact, Facebook use was associated with <i>lower</i> levels of relationship satisfaction. That’s something worth thinking about. </p>
<p>What <i>is</i> surprising about this study is that the humble telephone call displayed little to no relation with communication satisfaction or relationship satisfaction, quite unlike its video counterpart, Skype, revealing that being able to see your partner is a core component to maintaining a healthy relationship even when apart.</p>
<p>Based on this study, it seems clear that a mode of communication that involves a visual component—as Skype and picture messaging do—is an effective indicator of relationship satisfaction. The researchers suggest this is due to the presence of non-verbal as well as audio cues resulting in greater communication satisfaction and thereby more satisfaction with the relationship overall. So if you’re in an LDR, the more you talk to your partner over Skype (with the camera on), the more satisfied you will be with your relationship. Then again, if you’re in an LDR, you probably already knew that. </p>

A shadow of a large close panting man dressed as a clown carrying rusty garden shears with a cardboard box tucked under one arm. That’s dripping. Dripping a thick, red ooze.</p><p>Time to leg it, n’est pas?</p><p>Dave the Party Clown stares after you, bewildered, stows his novelty-sized balloon scissors, and sprints off once more to find the kids’ party, stressing that the strawberry ice-creams are melting fast.</p><p>Each new thing you noticed about Dave increased your sense of danger, added more evidence of an imminent threat. And when enough evidence had been gathered, when the cumulative creeping sensation got too much, your brain decided the threat was real — and escape was the best course of action. Flee!</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0244-6?WT.feed_name=subjects_synaptic-transmission">New work by Tiago Branco and his team</a> — including Dominic Evans and Vanessa Stempel — has now shown us exactly how the brain makes this decision. And at its heart is a brilliant move by evolution to turn a bug of biology — a failure — into a feature.</p><p>From your experience with Dave, you now know that somewhere in your brain adds up evidence of a threat, and somewhere then sets a threshold for when enough evidence means “now run like buggery”.</p><p>To find out where, we can’t sit people in a room and menace them with clowns. And even if we were allowed to, we can’t stick electrodes inside their brains to record their neurons while being clown-menaced. So Branco and team turned to that workhorse of neuroscience, the mouse.</p><p>Place a mouse in a box, with a handy little dark shelter at one end to feel safe in. Let it roam free, exploring, scouting its new home. Now make a shadow fall over it, a shadow that rapidly grows in size. A rapidly growing shadow that looks uncannily like a diving bird. Result: mouse tears back to the shelter, and cowers deep in the darkness, little heart thudding.</p><p>The clever bit is that the darkness of shadow is the evidence of an imminent threat: the darker the shadow, the greater the perceived threat. If the shadow is very dark, the mouse runs as soon as it starts to get bigger. If the shadow is very light, it can take four or five repeats of the swooping shadow for the mouse to finally decide to run for shelter.</p><p>With this swooping shadow controlling both evidence and escape, we can then look in the brain and ask: what adds up the evidence of a swooping shadow, and what drives “leg it” when that evidence hits a threshold? Branco and team already had clues about where to start: for we already know that it should somehow involve the superior colliculus.</p><p>The superior colliculus sits atop the brainstem, and is the privileged recipient of information directly from the retina — it gets to know what’s going on in the world long before you do. (Before you ask: yes, there is also an “inferior” colliculus. And as the superior colliculus does seeing, and the inferior does hearing, that gives you some idea of the pecking order in neuroscience). And the output of the superior colliculus <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308007691?via%3Dihub">definitely controls movement</a>. So if we’re looking for a bit of brain that can quickly add up information from the eyes and then make you move, the superior colliculus is the superior candidate. <br /> <br />So Branco and team used the armoury of modern neuroscience to find out if this was more than mere guesswork.</p><p>They switched off the output neurons of the superior colliculus. Now the mouse did not react to the swooping shadow. Just carried on exploring. As though someone had completely removed its threat detector.</p><p>They recorded the activity of the output neurons. The neurons dramatically increased their activity right from the start of the swooping shadow. The activity increased far more when escape happened than when it didn’t. And the stronger the activity, the faster the mouse started to escape. As though the activity in superior colliculus was adding up evidence of a threat.</p><p>They turned on these output neurons of the superior colliculus, when there was no swooping shadow. This is the crucial test, to see if the brain can be fooled into thinking there was an imminent threat. And it could: turning on these neurons made the mouse run for shelter. Even better, the more the neurons were activated, the more likely the mouse ran to the shelter, exactly as though the neurons were signalling the imminence of danger.</p><p>All in all, pretty damn convincing that the superior colliculus is the threat detector. The obvious next question was: what is the superior colliculus talking to, saying “it’s time to run”?</p><p>Enter the Periaqueductal Gray. Good grief neuroscientists are so bad at names: it’s a bit of grey stuff around (‘peri’) an aqueduct in the brain. Let’s call it PeGy, shall we? PeGy does a lot of things. One bit of it controls taking a piss, for example. But it gets a massive input from the superior colliculus, and it controls a lot of rapid reactions.</p><p>So Branco and team dusted off their neuroscience magic tricks again, popped some new mice in the swooping-shadow box, and set to work.</p><p>They turned off PeGy’s neurons. Now the mice did see the swooping shadow, did react to the threat. But they didn’t run away. At all. They just froze in place (the other option: stop moving, as predator brains track movement). PeGy, it seems, controls running away.</p><p>They recorded PeGy’s neurons. Their activity increased right as the escape started, and not a moment before. So PeGy’s neurons don’t add up evidence, but sure seem to mean “run”.</p><p>And the clincher: they turned on PeGy’s neurons when no shadow was swooping, again pretending there was a threat. Beautifully, as they activated more and more neurons, they found an all-or-nothing response. If too few neurons were activated, the mouse never ran for shelter. But if just enough neurons were activated, the mouse always ran for shelter. Nothing in between — no ifs, buts, or maybes. When PeGy says go, you go.</p><p>That all-or-nothing response raises the crucial question: what sets that threshold between escaping or not? It’s definitely something between the colliculus and PeGy, for when Branco and team turned off just that connection it turned off escaping completely. It seems the superior colliculus activity goes straight into PeGy’s neurons to turn evidence of a threat into running away. So why doesn’t every increase in superior colliculus activity trigger PeGy’s command to run away?</p><p>Because it turns out the connections from the superior colliculus to PeGy are weak, and rubbish. The activity of one neuron is carried to its targets by little spikes of electricity. Each spike barrelling down from one colliculus neuron into PeGy — and there are a lot of these spikes — creates just a tiny blip in the PeGy neuron. And it would need tens or hundreds of these blips to make a PeGy neuron output just one spike. Each connection is weak.</p><p>If it does anything at all. On average, 20% of all spikes from the colliculus do nothing at all in PeGy. The spike gets to the end and — zip, nada, niente. No response at all in the PeGy neuron. Each connection is rubbish: spikes can just fail.</p><p>A weak, rubbish connection means that the colliculus needs to send a lot of spikes, all at the same time, to get a response out of PeGy. The weak, rubbishness is the threshold. Those light swooping shadows, each eliciting just a bit of activity from the colliculus, did not create enough activity to overcome the weak rubbishness of the connection to PeGy. But the dark, intense shadows drove a wave of intense activity out of colliculus into PeGy, overwhelmed the weak rubbishness — and escape was the only option.</p><p>This work has two particularly beautiful lessons for those who study the brain. The first is that we have a complex behaviour — escaping by running to a shelter — now drilled down to a single connection in the brain, and the properties of that specific connection. For that connection <strong>is</strong> the threshold: its weakness and unreliability set the threshold — they are the limits to overcome.</p><p>The second is that the rubbishness of the connections between neurons — the failure of spikes — is well known. Spike failure is seen all over the brain, and causes much head-scratching. Spikes cost a lot of energy to make and send. So why send them if they’re just going to fail? It seems failure may be an inevitable bug of biology, a price to pay for sending spikes.</p><p>But here this bug is a feature. Evolution has co-opted the failure of spikes to create a threshold between escaping and not escaping. Has used the failure of spikes as a way to filter out things that are not threatening, to make sure you don’t run away at every sudden noise, or every looming shadow.</p><p>Or perhaps you do. For if the failure of this connection is the threshold between staying or fleeing, then perhaps it defines how afraid you are, how much threat you can tolerate before you flee. For if in your brain this connection is working just fine, if it is not failing badly, then you’d flee at the drop of a pin. So the nervous, rejoice: your brain is perhaps just too perfect.</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>A number of notable figures from psychology’s past held an interest in parapsychology or psi (the study of mental phenomena that defy current scientific understanding), including William James, Alexander Luria, Binet, Freud, and Fechner. But today the field is cordoned off; and when it encroaches into mainstream publications, as with the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/11/12/dramatic-study-shows-participants-are-affected-by-psychological-phenomena-from-the-future/">Feeling the Future</a>” experiments conducted by Daryl Bem in 2012, furore typically follows. To sceptics, the fact that these experiments produced positive results is <i>ipso facto</i> proof <a href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html">that psychology’s methods</a> <a href="http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/2014/06/25/a-skeptics-review/">must be broken</a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s only logical to take this view if you have already ruled out the existence of psychic phenomena and, at least among the US public, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx">the majority haven’t</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even in the chronically suspicious British culture, one quarter of people <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/10/05/do-you-believe-psychics/">have consulted a psychic</a>. I too am personally quite open to the existence of such phenomena, so I’ve been eager for an accessible overview of the field of parapsychology as it currently stands. This is what parapsychology researcher Etzel Cardeña, Director of the Centre for Research on Consciousness and Anomalous Psychology at Lund University, attempts to provide in his <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-24699-001">new review</a> in <i>American Psychologist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><span id="more-34118"></span></p>
<p>One of the main areas that Cardeña focuses on is “anomalous cognition”, which involves coming to know something without using the normal senses. Cardeña cites a pair of meta-analyses combining previous data that involved a forced-choice procedure popular in the middle of the last century (imagine a set up similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ohlA__xABw">Peter Venkman’s experiment in Ghostbusters</a> where he asked participants to guess which of a series of symbols was printed on a concealed card). The meta-analyses indicate consistently small but significant effects (around .02) – that is, participants were able to detect the correct answer better than if they had been guessing.</p>
<p>Related, but new to me, are so-called “hidden reward” experiments. In one example, participants choose from an array of kanji characters (Japanese writing using Chinese letters) the one they prefer aesthetically, unaware that choosing a certain character will produce benefits for their partner in another room. Cardeña cites a review that suggestst participants tend towards the characters that help out their partner.</p>
<p>These forced-choice approaches are still used, but the psi research community has turned more enthusiasm towards a free-response technique called the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/15/how-experimenters-influenced-participants-in-the-ganzfeld-parapsychology-experiment/">Ganzfeld procedure</a>”. Blindfolded participants in a soundproofed room say what comes into their mind in an attempt to describe a film clip that they have not seen (they are either shown it later, or it may be playing simultaneously in another location). If judges can use these descriptions to pick between this clip and other distractor clips, this is used as evidence that the participant detected information about the clip without using their physical senses. Meta-analyses of the field suggest a statistically significant effect of about .14 to .15. Some critics have suggested that the effect size goes down when lower quality studies are excluded, but others contend that the opposite is true, with the best studies showing the strongest evidence. Either way, the effects are strikingly larger for selected participants – those who were familiar with the studies or who were chosen because they had traits previously associated with stronger psi effects, such self-efficacy, extraversion and openness-to-experience.</p>
<p>A similar pattern is found in remote viewing, an analogous procedure where a sender attempts to provide information about where they are to a participant located elsewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Similar to Bem’s controversial “Feeling the Future” experiments, Cardeña also reviews findings from “presentiment studies”, where effects are looked for prior to an event, such as skin conductance changes before seeing emotionally-charged images. Here there is a significant effect size across 26 data sets, with the higher quality studies having larger effects than the lower quality ones.</p>
<p>Another field of psi research considers psychokinesis, which is mental action altering physical objects without the “normal” mechanism of thought affecting the body first. This is typically investigated using subtle changes, such as influencing the fall of a dice or perturbing the action of a random number generator. While meta-analyses suggest significant effects, these are generally flimsier than those in the area of anomalous cognition: smaller and less robust – for example, some show clusters of significant findings near <em>p</em>=.05, which researchers now use as a marker of questionable research practices. The research into non-contact healing effects also suffers from these criticisms and is additionally hard to shield from potential placebo influences.</p>
<p>Cardeña concludes that “overall the meta-analyses have been supportive of the psi hypothesis” (i.e. indicating that anomalous effects are real), with the strongest findings for free-response experiments on anomalous cognition like the Ganzfeld work, and weaker for forced-choice designs and work in the psychokinesis sub-field. On this basis, it is arguable that, as much as any other field of psychology, there is at least something meriting investigation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But psi isn’t any other field of psychology. Because of its claims, it is understandably held to high standards and many dismiss the findings as being due to poor quality methods. In fact this scrutiny has forced psi research to be ahead of the game on many research practices. It pioneered randomisation with masking (concealing group allocation from participants and researchers, to reduce bias); produced some of the earliest meta-analytical work; and has been preregistering studies for over forty years. Cardeña also argues that, rare for psychology, this is a field in which non-replications are incentivised.</p>
<p>However, even if there is solid supporting evidence, sceptics allege the endeavour is fundamentally ascientific because there are no mechanisms or models to understand the putative effects. To address this criticism, Cardeña lays out the model most psi researchers ground their work in, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>centres on three concepts well-established in physics. The first is “non-locality” – while science tends to focus on demonstrating direct cause and effect – one billiard ball striking another – quantum mechanics (QM) shows evidence of “spooky” action at a distance, raising the possibility that all things are in some way fundamentally entangled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The second idea is that objects are in themselves not fully determined, but remain as probability functions until they are measured by a sentient observer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The third idea relates to the post-Einsteinian notion that events in the future of a slow-moving individual may have already happened to a faster moving one. Some theories account for such issues by positing that all times co-exist simultaneously. Cardeña gives the example that measuring the spin of a particle appears “to retroactively determine the spin of a delayed photon entangled with it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These three ideas add up to an interpretation in which objective matter and subjective perspective are not firmly separate, but interlace, where reality may be (mostly) experienced in a sequential temporal fashion but is in some sense simultaneous or eternal. These ideas are absent from certain influential modern world views such as Marxism and positivism, and they understandably clash with the causal metaphors that most people – especially the scientifically minded – use to organise their experience. But it’s worth remembering that they are preeminent historically in almost every philosophical and folk tradition across the world, including tallying with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">idealism</a>, in which mind is primary to the material (idealism can also accommodate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreality_of_Time">counterintuitive takes on time</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But yet another criticism is that if psi effects are real, why aren’t we all Professor Xs with amazing telepathy and why are the effects so small? Well, the fact that something exists doesn’t mean it needs to operate like in the movies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It makes sense for our fragile bodies to be organised to mainly respond to sensory and bodily stimuli – hearing or seeing something new or threatening should always win in the battle for attention, potentially masking psi effects most of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The small effects found in studies may also reflect the fact that the stakes are especially low – far lower than the situations in which people spontaneously report such experiences, such as around the sudden sickness or death of a loved one. The effect sizes also reflect the average of all people, and the studies seem to show that subsets of individuals are more receptive to psi experiences, producing much higher effects when they alone are tested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  C</span>ardeña also points out that some of the psi meta-analysis effect sizes approach those found in social psychology research, and are larger than for some evidence-based practices such as using aspirin for heart conditions.</p>
<p>Cardeña concludes that psi has vertical and horizontal support: “vertical” meaning that different protocols have provided consistent effects over years or decades of investigation, even as protocols have become more rigorous; and “horizontal” meaning a pattern of results across different areas (e.g. similar profiles of people who perform better at tasks). According to researcher Dean Radin, findings from parapsychology suggest “that there is some way that humans are connected with the rest of reality in non-local ways.” Should psychology and funding bodies be paying more attention?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Goalkeeper Game, a tool for massive data collection and experiments</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">NeuroMat's Goalkeeper Game has evolved as two concomitant research, development directions. Firstly, the game, that had a first version launched in early 2016, is being developed as a tool for massive data collection. Secondly, the game remains a resource for efficient diagnosis and allows for changes in settings for experiments. Challenges in these two directions have been advanced by a multidisciplinary team within NeuroMat's innovation area.

<p>When you’re in the middle of a gruelling long-distance run and the pain and fatigue is becoming overwhelming, an obvious strategy is to try to force the subjective experience out of your mind, for example by thinking nice thoughts or focusing on the environment around you. The trouble is, as the physical struggle intensifies, the distraction strategy becomes harder and harder to pull off. According to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-018-9697-z">new paper</a> in <em>Motivation and Emotion</em>, an alternative approach that holds promise is to practice “cognitive reappraisal” – don’t ignore the sensations as such, but try to view them in a dispassionate way, as if you are a scientist studying running or a journalist reporting on the experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-34107"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, including Grace Giles and other members of the Cognitive Science Team at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in Massachusetts, recruited 24 healthy runners (aged 18 to 33, and including 15 women) whose lifestyle included completing at least one run of over nine miles per week.</p>
<p>The runners visited the research lab on three occasions, each time completing a 90-minute treadmill run, keeping their heart rate in the range of 75 to 85 per cent of their maximum – a level classified as “vigorous exercise”.</p>
<p>The first visit, the runners were given no specific instructions to follow in terms of how to cope with the challenge. On the second and third visits they were told to either use “cognitive reappraisal” (to adopt a neutral, detached attitude toward the subjective experience, like a scientist or journalist studying it) or “distraction” (thinking about things besides the run). They also received reminders through the run to use whichever strategy was allocated for that session.</p>
<p>Based on psychological measures they completed before each run, every 30-minutes during, and again afterwards, the participants felt they were exerting themselves less when they followed the “cognitive reappraisal” strategy and they experienced lower levels of emotional arousal, as compared with the run in which they were given no coping instructions. This was despite maintaining the same pace and heart-rate. In contrast, the distraction instructions appeared to make no difference to feelings of exertion or emotional arousal compared with the control run.</p>
<p>Giles and her team said their results are “relatively novel” and support previous findings that suggested distraction is an unreliable technique. “Instead cognitive reappraisal may benefit exercise experience relative to not using a cognitive strategy,” they concluded.</p>
<p>The findings come with some hefty caveats. Based on the researchers’ own manipulation check that involved asking participants to say which of several statements best described their thought processes during the runs, the participants did not actually engage in cognitive reappraisal during the cognitive reappraisal run. That said, the researchers reconsidered the statements they’d previously identified as reflecting cognitive reappraisal and decided they weren’t really appropriate – at least not to in relation to how they’d framed cognitive reappraisal in their instructions. On further reflection, they felt the runners’ choice of descriptive statements did suggest they had practiced the strategy adequately after all. They may be right, but these post-hoc gymnastics make the study findings feel less convincing.</p>
<p>Another issue to bear in mind is that these were fit, experienced runners – their average rating for their exertion during the runs was “somewhat hard” and they generally found the experience enjoyable. The findings might not generalise to less fit runners or more arduous challenges.</p>
<p>On a positive note, however, especially if you are new to running or finding it tough, the researchers reckon that both the emotion regulation strategies they tested might have a greater benefit for runners who usually find the experience less enjoyable.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you find nothing works to take the suffering away, at least take comfort from earlier research that suggested <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/16/marathon-runners-forget-how-painful-it-was/">your brain will trick you into remembering that the pain wasn’t really so bad.</a></p>

<p>Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin—what unites these three exceptional individuals? It is widely accepted that all three were geniuses, but there is something else. These days, neuroscientists believe that all three suffered from a specific neurological disorder called Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
<p>The whole definition of the term “<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/25/scholarship-for-college-students-living-with-a-neurological-disorder/">neurological disorder</a>” implies that something is going wrong in the brain. However, there is a growing recognition of the fact that when it comes to the processes in our brain, “going wrong” does not necessarily mean “going bad”. Our brain is too complicated a mechanism to be interpreted in simplistic terms. Some neurological disorders produce a peculiar state of mind often associated with high artistic and scientific achievements.</p>
<p>Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) is a developmental and neurological disorder that is often associated with symptoms of social withdrawal, motor clumsiness, and impaired communication skills. <em>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM-5)</em> classified AS in the same category as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/16/new-link-between-autism-and-the-gut-microbiota/">Autism Spectrum Disorder</a> (ASD). It is often referred to as ‘High-functioning’ Autism (HFA), as individuals with AS are more intellectually capable and show less severe abnormalities compared to ASD subjects.</p>
<p>The story of AS and autism started in the 1940s, when two Viennese Scientists, Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, described a syndrome observed in some children, with the unique characteristics of social isolation, impaired communication skills, and restrictive and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/10/when-hoarding-becomes-dangerous/">obsessive interests</a>. Both scientists used the term ‘autistic’ in their reports.  While Kanner’s syndrome was published right away in 1943, Asperger’s report was written in German and remained undiscovered until 1991 when it reappeared in Uta Frith’s textbook <em>Autism and AS</em>.</p>
<p>Research and publications on Asperger’s syndrome reached its peak during 2000-2012. Different research groups proposed a set of criteria for AS diagnosis. While several of these criteria were overlapping, WHO’s International Classification of Diseases and Disorders set the following key characteristics that can be diagnostic for Asperger’s Syndrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative social impairment involving dysfunctional social adaptivity, impaired non-verbal communication for interaction and lack of social reciprocity.</li>
<li>Restrictive pattern of interest, motor clumsiness, repetitive behavior, and extreme obsessiveness to specific rituals.</li>
<li>AS patients must show age-specific, normal cognitive and linguistic development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the father of Asperger Syndrome, Hans Asperger, described AS patients to be characteristically distinct from ASD subjects. He characterized them as intellectually-able, abstract-loving, and even overachieving in some specific cognitive domains.</p>
<p>Decades after Asperger’s observation, recent studies have also found that AS patients often demonstrate high verbal IQ, strong grammatical skills and they often outperform others in fluid reasoning although they are reported to show a delayed reaction time with poor performance IQ, specifically in symbol coding and processing speed.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, AS is more common than <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/02/causes-of-autism-remain-mysterious/">classical autism</a>. Epidemiological surveys report that about 4 out of every 10,000 children are autistic whereas about 25 out of 10,000 children are diagnosed with AS. AS is more common in boys than girls. No scientific explanation behind this observation exists at present.</p>
<p>Like with many other syndromes, no single specific cause is responsible for AS. Rather, a milieu of factors is associated with its development.</p>
<p>Children diagnosed with AS show a genetic pattern, like in autism, where at least one of the parents (most often the father) is diagnosed with AS or at least have some hallmark AS characteristics. The relatives of AS children are known to have <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">anxiety or depression related disorders</a>.</p>
<p>An important causal factor behind the development of AS might be the altered level of neurotransmitters. In AS patients, higher levels of N-Acetyl Aspartate/Choline (precursor of acetylcholine) intake and increased dopamine levels were reported, suggesting an overall altered dopaminergic neurotransmitter composition in major areas of the brain. Intranasal injection of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/04/the-multiple-faces-of-love-hormone-oxytocin/">oxytocin</a>, a neuropeptide, was shown to improve facial emotion recognition abilities in AS patients.</p>
<p>Apart from alterations in neurotransmitter levels, neuroimaging studies show that there are structural changes in major areas of the brain that could be associated with the development of Asperger’s Syndrome. Altered grey and white matter volumes were observed in major brain regions, and an abnormal thickness of the hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex was reported to be the major contributing factor for dysregulated cognitive functions in AS.</p>
<p>Some researchers also proposed that environmental factors can contribute indirectly to the development of AS. Viral or bacterial infection and smoking during pregnancy particularly increases the risk factor, although no concrete evidence supporting these views was found.</p>
<p>Due to the substantial number of overlapping similarities between Asperger’s Syndrome and Autism, it is very easy to confuse one with the other.</p>
<p>Studies in recent decades showed differences between AS and ASD on both quantitative and qualitative levels. The AS subjects displayed age-specific or earlier verbal development, meticulous speech ability, higher desire for social reciprocation, and supreme imagination compared to ASD patients.</p>
<p>On a cognitive level, AS subjects are more perceptive, they possess superior verbal performance and visual-spatial ability compared to ASD patients.</p>
<p>But the major limitations of these studies is the huge variability within the study groups and contradictions in the data patterns, as with age, the distinction between AS and ASD significantly reduces. It is particularly difficult to categorize AS from other disorders as there are no known biomarkers specific to AS only.</p>
<p>As there is not sufficient evidence of distinguishable characteristics for AS that can class the syndrome as ‘one biologically and clinically diagnosed entity’, the DSM-V in 2013 revised and categorized Asperger’s Syndrome as another variant of ASD. Although this decision was criticized by the scientific community, most of the researchers agreed that there is a need to conduct more studies that could help in distinguishing AS from other ASDs.</p>
<p>The most general misconception about Asperger’s syndrome or, as a matter of fact, about autism spectrum disorders in general, is that they develop because of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/13/how-attachment-and-parenting-style-affect-adult-relationships/">poor parenting and a lack of bonding</a> between parents and their child. This concept was even termed as ‘Refrigerator Mother’ to describe cold and distant parenting. But this notion was challenged from the 1960’s when research on these neurological disorders started to grow and scientists found that it is not parenting, but rather the genetic and neurological makeup of the child that is responsible for these syndromes.  Even today, the belief that neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a traumatic childhood are common. The reality, however, is more complicated than our guesses based on limited information.</p>

<p>Is sexting a good thing, because it’s sexually liberating, or a bad thing, because it’s objectifying? Separate research groups have put forward both arguments. But according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2018.1438576">new study</a> of college students in Hong Kong, it’s both.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s estimated that roughly half of US college students (on which most research in this area has been done) send nude or sexually provocative images by phone or the internet. In the new study, reported in the <i>Journal of Sex Research</i>, the proportion was lower (13.6 per cent), perhaps because Chinese culture has a lower level of sexual permissiveness, but sexting was still relatively common, with almost one in five men and one in ten women saying they do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34103"></span></p>
<p>As the authors Mario Liong at Ritsumeikan University in Japan and Grand H.L. Cheng at the Duke-National University of Singapore, point out, some researchers have argued that sexting promotes objectification – the presentation of the body as an object to be judged, generally by prevailing cultural standards. But others have argued that it empowers people sexually, as they can be in more control of their own sexuality than they might be during a physical encounter.</p>
<p>To investigate who might be right, Liong and Cheng recruited 361 students, aged between 17 and 24, who filled in questionnaires that asked first whether they had ever sexted, and then assessed their views on so-called “body surveillance” (how often during the day they think about how they look, for example); feelings of body shame (they had to report the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements like “I feel ashamed of myself when I haven’t made the effort to look my best”); body control beliefs (“I can weigh what I’m supposed to when I try hard enough”, for instance); and, finally, comfort with nudity (for example, participants rated their comfort with situations such as “Being totally nude while sitting with a nude significant other”).</p>
<p>The results showed that among both men and women sexters had higher levels of body surveillance, which seemed to mediate their higher levels of body shame. But they were also more comfortable with nudity than non-sexters. There was no relationship between sexting and body control beliefs.</p>
<p>Increased body shame clearly isn’t desirable. But a greater comfort with nudity likely is, and this finding relates to experiences reported by erotic performers on live video cameras, the researchers argue: “When sexters pose erotically to take sexual pictures, they develop a liberated sexual subjectivity and become more comfortable with their bodies.”</p>
<p>The researchers point out that sexting is generally seen by authority figures – educators, parents and policymakers – as being unequivocally bad, whereas they believe their new results show it’s important to “break with [this] idea that sexting is simply harmful”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers did only capture a snapshot in time, however, so it’s possible that the influences go the other way: people who are more comfortable with being nude are more likely to sext, and to experience self-objectification in the process. Longitudinal studies will be needed to investigate further. Also, this study did not look at whether the frequency of sexting had any impact, or whether there might be different effects for homosexual vs. heterosexual men and women. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers readily point out, “More research is needed to understand the ways in which digital media have transformed sexuality and how individuals make use of this new tool to assert their sexual agency, despite being simultaneously constrained by it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Astyanax_fasciatus_Mexican_blind_cavefish_1_15719439215-e1530093880320-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Mexican Tetra come in two distinct forms: the river dwelling surface fish and the far stranger cavefish, which have no eyes, and are found in isolated caves in North America.</p>
<p>Surface fish are typical river fish, they school; sleep at night, pay well-balanced attention to food, predators and mates; and calmly hover while resting. In contrast, cavefish swim continuously; rarely interact with mates or sleep; exhibit repetitive behavior patterns like circling around at the middle of a water column; and they have higher levels of cortisol, the anxiety hormone, in their blood.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10318" style="width: 308px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10318" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cavefish-298x300.jpg" width="298" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The two forms of Mexican Tetra: surface fish and cavefish.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>These symptoms have similarities with those exhibited by people diagnosed with ASD, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/symptoms">characterized by</a> having difficulty in socially interacting with others, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, imbalanced attention, and anxiety.</p>
<p>We do not believe that these shared behaviors between human and fish are at the same level of complexity but they seem to be driven by evolutionarily conserved neural wirings. For example, emotion-based behavior, attention, socialness, and sleep regulation are based on conserved neural networks in the brain, such as the cortical region, thalamus, hypothalamus and habenula.</p>
<p>Findings from our recent study suggest that behaviors that we have observed in cavefish are evolutionarily conserved between fish and human.</p>
<h3><strong>ASD-risk genes in cavefish</strong></h3>
<p>We made comprehensive surveys for cavefish orthologs (genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor) of human ASD-risk genes. By referring to these genes, we found some surprising similarities between cavefish and human.</p>
<p>Most of the orthologs of ASD-risk genes in cavefish and ASD patients shared the same polarities of gene expressions (up or down-regulation of gene expression). This level of similarity is very high compared with other ASD rodent models and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from ASD patients.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10319" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-10319" height="223" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/lab-setup-1024x356.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Lab setup</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Mexican Tetra: surface fish </div></figure>
<p>We also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage and found that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. Interestingly, ASD-risk genes are also positively selected in humans.</p>
<p>We are currently testing human ASD treatment drugs for fish social behaviors. We suggest that fish and human evolution share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.</p>
<p>We and other groups believe that many cavefish behaviors are beneficial to finding food in the dark. But how did ASD-risk genes evolve in humans?</p>
<p>Human geneticist <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006618">Polimanti et al.</a> and others state that ASD is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, college completion, and years of schooling. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3863">Weiner et al.</a> suggest many of ASD-risk genes are thought to provide cumulative effects that can lead to ASD. In other words, if you have a few ASD-risk mutations, you may have a better academic success; however, if you have mutations in many ASD-risk genes you have higher risk to express ASD.</p>
<h3><strong>ASD like behaviors in other species</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from cavefish, we do not know of any animal models that naturally show a series of autism-related behaviors. However, a recent study by <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9653">Shpigler et al.</a> suggested that ASD-risk genes are an evolutionary conserved gene set that regulates socialness in both honeybees and humans.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>We still have limited knowledge of the evolution of socialness and other behaviors in the context of adaptation because many of these behaviors are complex and are regulated by multiple genes. Based on the comparative studies between human, cavefish, and bee, it is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to test whether a set of ASD-risk genes are repeatedly targeted in other rapidly evolving species such as cichlid fishes in the lakes of East Africa, Trinidad guppies, and green anole lizards.</p>
<p>In the context of ASD-like behaviors, deer mice are known to show repetitive behavior under the novel environment. In addition, there are a number of domestic mutant mice including BTBR mice, and gene knock out-mice, which have lost the functions of ASD-risk genes. Many of them are characterized with their impairments in social interaction, lack of interest in cohorts, altered vocalization pattern, and stereotypic repetitive behaviors.</p>
<p>All of these are suggested as ASD-like behaviors by sharing the molecular and neural mechanisms to express ASD-like behaviors. However, these models do not overlap with systemic defects seen in ASD such as immune deficiency or impairment of digestive system. As we start characterizing that cavefish shows similar changes in both systems in addition to a set of ASD-like behaviors, we believe that cavefish can also fill a gap of systemic understanding of ASD, and can provide a foundation for new ASD therapy.</p>

<strong>Can psychology help us to be funnier?</strong> Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com">Ginny Smith</a> hears how a key ingredient of humour is “incongruity” and the surprise of unexpected meanings. Individual words too can be amusing, but actually most of the time we laugh not because we’ve seen or heard a joke, but as a natural part of friendly interaction.</p>
<p>Our guests, in order of appearance, are: Cardiff University neuroscientist <a href="http://www.deanburnett.com">Dean Burnett</a>, author of <em>The Happy Brain</em>; psychologist <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas_Engelthaler">Tomas Engelthaler</a> at the University of Warwick, who co-authored a paper on the funniest words in English; and “stand up scientist” <a href="https://speechcommunicationlab.weebly.com">Sophie Scott</a> at UCL, who gave the 2017 Christmas lectures on the neuroscience of voices, speech and laughter.</p>

The travesty around the data faking regenerative medicine enthusiast Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson is finally over. Her Swedish employer University of Gotheburg (GU) announced yesterday to have opened labour law proceedings against her, with the expressed goal of her dismissal as university professor. No appeal is possible anymore, and her loyal GU supporters Elias Eriksson and Kristoffer … <a class="more-link" href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/06/27/gothenburg-to-sack-sumitran-holgersson-requests-7-retractions/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Gothenburg to sack Sumitran-Holgersson, requests 7 retractions</span> <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The gallbladder is a pear shaped organ located within the abdomen of the human body. The primary function of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate the bile fluid produced by the human liver. Bile fluid plays an integral role in the digestion and absorption of fats from the human gut. However, due to its function as a bile concentrating organ, the gallbladder is also prone to develop gallstones. Gallstone disease is one of the commonest reasons why humans undergo a surgical intervention.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere; however it is still the fifth commonest malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract. Annually, there are roughly 4000-5000 new cases of gallbladder cancer diagnosed in the United States. A vast majority of the gallbladder cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages of disease (stage III and above) resulting in poor clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The mean survival after a gallbladder cancer diagnosis is a mere six months. The five year survival (a metric to assess cancer outcomes) is less than 3-8% for stage III gallbladder cancer and above. It is one of the deadliest cancers we know of.</p>
<p>Gallbladder cancer incidence has a unique global distribution as well. Most of the cancers known to mankind tend to be relatively uniformly distributed across countries and continents. In contrast, gallbladder cancer incidence is increased in geographically distinct locations of the world. These include places such as Chile, Northern parts of India and the state of New Mexico in the United States. What are the common drivers unique to these locations leading to increased gallbladder cancer incidence? We do not know for sure at the present time.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In addition to the unique geographical distribution, people of specific ethnicities appear to be more prone to gallbladder cancer as well. This includes the Native American populations of the North American continent. Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state. While there are a multitude of risk factors that have been implicated in the causation of gallbladder cancer, there are no definitive associations. In our current review, we discuss these issues along with some likely factors implicated in the process of development of gallbladder cancers.</span></p>
<p>Another interesting feature is the elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer in women compared to men. Gallbladder cancer is one of the few cancers which has an elevated female incidence relative to men. Women are prone to develop gallstones in general. However, this does not explain the complete risk associated with increased gallbladder cancer development seen among women. Higher levels of estrogen may be one of the risk factors needed to drive gallbladder cancers and we need more research to understand its role in the development of this cancer.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10301" style="width: 1956px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10301 size-full" height="909" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/12885_2018_4575_Fig1_HTML.png" width="1946" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Gallbladder incidence in women compared to men of New Mexico from 2000 to 2014.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Figure 1, Nemunaitis et al</div></figure>
<p>A significant drawback in our understanding of gallbladder cancer is the lack of readily available cell line and animal models. Additionally, funding for gallbladder cancer research is very limited, impeding our understanding of this disease. In order to make a dent in this disease, global collaborative efforts are critically needed through pooled resources and improving the collective knowledge of this disease across institutions. Instances of such collaborative efforts include the Chile Gallbladder Cancer Pilot Study and the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study led by Dr Jill Koshiol at the NIH.</p>
<p>Finally, clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease. With the new emerging focus on personalized medicine/oncology, research into targetable markers in gallbladder cancer patients is urgently required. Interestingly, gallbladder and biliary tract cancers appear to have an interesting array of potential molecular targets which may be amenable to targeted therapeutics. Clinical trials and basic research efforts are urgently needed to establish the validity of these approaches to move the translational research findings back to gallbladder cancer patients.</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another issue which we highlight in our review is the issue related to rural oncology healthcare access. New Mexico is a predominantly rural state. Native Americans in the state live on reservations which are far-flung, lacking immediate access to oncology care. This means that the gallbladder cancer patients are often reluctant to travel far distances to obtain the necessary and appropriate care. One of the authors  (UBG) is currently setting up a pilot clinical trial to enable tele-oncology based initiatives to address these issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our review paper highlights the major outstanding issues associated with gallbladder cancer. Due to the regional importance of this cancer within the state of New Mexico where both of us currently practice, we have sought to highlight the challenges surrounding gallbladder cancer in this review. There are currently far more questions than available answers surrounding this cancer. We are currently moving ahead with multiple initiatives (basic and clinical research) at our own institution (University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center) to make a dent in this rare, but deadly form of cancer.</p>
