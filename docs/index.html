<p>In England there’s an independent health advisory body that provides guidelines to clinicians working in the NHS, to make sure that wherever patients are in the country, they receive the best possible evidence-backed care. <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) was set up in 1999 and many of its guidelines pertain to mental health, and they often promote psychological approaches – for example, the guidelines for depression state that talking therapies should be the first-line of treatment for all but the most severely affected patients. While clinical and counselling psychologists have been involved in producing these guidelines, many of their colleagues – especially those in practice – are highly critical of them. Why? A series of interviews with 11 clinical psychologists, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2054/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience">published in <em>Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy</em></a>, sheds new light on the scepticism and concern felt towards NICE guidelines, and why some psychologists are even deliberately ignoring them.</p>
<p><span id="more-15369"></span></p>
<p>Alex Court at the Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology interviewed 11 clinical psychologists “in routine practice in the NHS” for roughly an hour each. Court’s approach was open-ended and he began each interview by simply asking each psychologist to share their thoughts on the NICE guidelines. Court subsequently transcribed the interviews and together with his colleagues he set about looking for emerging themes in their answers. He kept a diary throughout, in part to reflect on how his own opinions might be influencing his interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>The psychologists valued the NICE guidelines for the way that they provide a useful roundup of the latest evidence relevant to a particular condition or social issue, and also for the fact they often promoted psychological approaches. However, many of the psychologists were also very concerned about the premise of the guidelines, especially their grounding in a medical perspective on psychological distress, and the implication that the evidence is “neat” and that there is a correct approach across the board. The psychologists felt this curtailed their freedom to use their judgment and tailor their approach to individual patients. In particular there was a feeling that the guidelines are biased toward Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), and that they could influence NHS commissioners and managers to favour cost-saving approaches, to the potential detriment of individual patients.</p>
<p>Given these concerns, some of the interviewees said they sometimes gave managers the impression that they were delivering NICE-approved treatments, even when they weren’t:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would probably say I’m doing CBT, even if I’m not doing, you know, even if it’s a bit fudgy around the edges,” said Jenny (the study doesn’t use the psychologists’ real names).</p>
<p>“I use approaches that aren’t in the NICE guidelines at all. Er I do what I see to be effective,” said Morgan.</p>
<p>“Well I, well I certainly wouldn’t advertise what I do to the managers,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“For me, they’re guidelines, rather than somebody telling me what to do,” said Kim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of what’s driving these psychologists’ concerns is that the influence of NICE guidelines has seen the emergence of single-approach therapists, such as CBT-therapists, who are cheaper for the NHS to employ but who arguably aren’t able to offer patients multifaceted, individually tailored care in the way that psychologists can:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… [A]s a clinical psychologist I will be bringing in lots of different therapy kind of techniques and models and formulations from different erm models of psychological therapies, so I don’t think it’s as purist as maybe NICE guidelines might encourage people to think,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“[Integration is] seen as weak or criticism, and actually I think that’s our biggest strength, and that’s what I mean by we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. As psychologists it would be nice if we actually worked to maintain our identity and what we have that’s special to offer,” said Jan .</p></blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on the interviews, Court and his colleagues said that there seemed to be a “perverse incentive” within the NHS for clinical psychologists “to claim to be doing protocol-driven, single-model therapy whilst actually conducting much more sophisticated interventions, drawing on a range of psychological theory and based on an individualised, formulation co-constructed with the service user.” The researchers also argued that their results highlight the need for NHS managers to allow clinical psychologists (and other skilled clinicians) flexibility in choosing the care they offer to service users, rather than being overly prescriptive. However, to play devil’s advocate, I would suggest the guidelines can help correct for <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/28/the-mistakes-that-lead-therapists-to-infer-psychotherapy-was-effective-when-it-wasnt/">the difficulty clinicians can have in judging whether their favoured approach is effective or not</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to know how representative these findings are of clinical psychologists more generally, and how much the research authors’ own feelings influenced the interviews and how they were interpreted. Court and his colleagues acknowledged the subjectivity in their research – “this study makes no claims that the findings are objective,” they wrote. It’s perhaps worth noting too that there was nothing random about the recruitment process – four of the interviewees were already known to Court (though they weren’t colleagues), and he chose others based on a pre-interview screening process to try to reflect a mix of opinions. Also, Court’s supervisor and co-author Anne Cook has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/17/were-not-surprised-half-our-psychologist-colleagues-are-depressed">written publicly</a> about the adverse effects of treatment time limits and targets on clinical psychologists, and it seems at least plausible that her own concerns about NICE guidelines may have influenced the tone of the paper.</p>
<p>That said, this research provides an important and rare insight into what some NHS clinical psychologists think of the official guidelines that are meant to be guiding how they work.</p>

            Retraction Watch reports on an initiative by the microbiology journal mSphere. Under the new system, the editors no longer take responsibility for inviting peer reviewers to evaluate each manuscript. Instead, the would-be authors are expected to find two reviewers themselves, and to submit the reviews along with their paper.

mSphere call this approach 'author-initiated peer review', but I like to think of it as the "Pick-Your-Own" system.

            <p>Arduino is a fantastic microcontroller platform, but the IDE can feel quite limiting once you go beyond “Hello world” projects. If you’ve outgrown the Arduino IDE, consider <a href="http://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 750px;"><img alt="PlatformIO IDE for IoT development" height="689" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.platformio.org/images/platformio-ide-for-atom.c6645c5e.png" width="750" />PlatformIO IDE for IoT development screenshot, from <a href="http://platformio.org/" rel="nofollow">http://platformio.org/</a></figure>
<p>PlatformIO is a a powerful IDE for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with some great features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports Arduino, ARM Cortex, and many other IoT platforms</li>
<li>Full-featured code editor based on Atom with tab-completion, inline help, multiple cursors, refactoring, the works</li>
<li>Supports Build, Upload, Unit Test actions with continuous integration options</li>
<li>Build files with sane library management</li>
<li>Serial port monitor with automatic restart</li>
</ul>
<p>These features really shine when you start building more complex projects.</p>
<p>Here I showcase how you can build and upload a simple multi-Arduino device project that would be a pain to manage otherwise.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Let’s say you want to build a system build out of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sender – an Arduino device with some attached sensors – captures information from the environment, and beams it into the air via XBee, Bluetooth, plain-jane RF, etc.</li>
<li>a receiver – a second Arduino device that reads the information from the first, remote Arduino device and actuates, e.g. some motors or servos</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arduino IDE is not well-adapted to this kind of problem, because it uses a paradigm where one sketch = one device. If you want to work on a project that uses two devices you have to use two separate .ino sketches, running in two separate processes. You have to manage these two projects separately, test and upload them on different schedules. Then what if you need to share some common headers, like, let’s say, a .h file which contains an encryption key for RF? That’s not straightforward at all.</p>
<p>PlatformIO makes it easy to work with multiple devices.</p>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p><a href="http://platformio.org/platformio-ide">Install the PlaformIO IDE</a>, fire up Atom, and start a new project. Add whatever device you want to support – I’m using the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-rfm69hcw-module?view=all">Adafruit Feather</a>, specifically the model which has an RFM69 RF module on it for radio communication. This will initialize a minimalist project with nothing in it:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Now create a new file under src/sender/blink.cpp, which will contain Arduino’s version of Hello world, the blink sketch:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// The Hello world of the Arduino world! Blink at 5Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your initial Arduino to a USB port, and hit Upload from the PlatformIO menu.</p>
<p>That’s it – you should get some output to the effect that the code was successfully built, your code should be uploaded to your Arduino, and the builtin LED should start flashing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hint: You can access all the build actions – build, upload, and test – using the F7 key.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Static address</h1>
<p>Use the PlatformIO &gt; List Serial Ports menu item to find which serial port your Arduino device is using. On Linux, the name of the device you be of the form `/dev/ttyACMXXX`; Macs instead have the form `/dev/USBXXX`. Now open the platformio.ini file at the root of your project, which was auto-generated for you. Mine looks like:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
</pre>
<p>We’re going to start by giving it a meaningful name, and assigning it to a specific upload port:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
upload_port=/dev/ttyACM0
</pre>
<p>Save the file, and upload again, you should get exactly the same result. While it seems like we haven’t done much, we’ve created the skeleton for our future build file for multiple devices. When you work on bigger project, you will also manage dependencies, and many other aspects of the project, through <a href="http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/projectconf.html">the platformio.ini file</a>.</p>
<h1>Two devices</h1>
<p>To extend this to two devices, it’s very straightforward. Make a new file in the project, src/receiver/blink.cpp. Set the interval for this one so it blinks more slowly:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// Blink this pup at 1Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your second device, list serial devices through the menu, and find out the name of the new device, e.g. /dev/ttyACM1. Now we’re ready to update the platformio.ini file:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; +&lt;sender/&gt; -&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM0

[env:feather32u4_receiver]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; -&lt;sender/&gt; +&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM1
</pre>
<p>We’ve added a second section corresponding to the second device. The important thing here is the addition of src_filter, which specifies which files are to be compiled and sent to each device. We specified – and + to specifically include and exclude subdirectories of the source folder.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>When you hit F7 this time, you’ll see many more options — you can Build, or Upload, which will send both sketches one after the other to their respective Arduinos. You can also build and upload for a specific environment, in which case only one Arduino will be updated.</p>
<p>If you upload both sketches, you will see your designated sender blink fast, and the designated receiver blink slowly.</p>
<h1>Shared files</h1>
<p>With this structure, it’s very easy to share a file between the two sketches. Simply create the src/constants.h file, with content, for example:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#DEFINE secret_key "OMGSOSECRet"
</pre>
<p>Then #include it in both the cpp files. Easy.</p>
<h1>Optional: static addresses</h1>
<p>The scheme here will work as long as you remember to reconnect your Arduinos in the right order — otherwise they’ll be assigned different TTY addresses and you’ll be uploading each sketch to the wrong place. To avoid this, you can change your udev rules to assign a static /dev address, e.g. `/dev/receiver`, to a given Arduino. <a href="http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/">Follow this tutorial here</a>, and update your platformio.ini file accordingly. It’s a bit of work but it will pay off later in the hassle you save.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=xcorr.net&amp;blog=3084329&amp;post=5903&amp;subd=xcorr&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

In today’s post, we review our 2016 accomplishments in this area and the progress we’ve made toward <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/" target="_blank">our goals</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ORCID Implementation</strong></p>
<p>In January, PLOS, eLife, the Royal Society and other major publishers developed and signed an <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter" target="_blank">Open Letter</a></strong> committing to follow best practices when collecting, processing and displaying ORCID iDs. Signatories further agreed to begin requiring by year end that each corresponding author associate their name with an ORCID iD and 15 signatories have already implemented this policy. As of December 7 this is now also PLOS policy—corresponding authors on manuscripts coming in to either of our submission systems (Editorial Manager or Aperta™) must provide an authenticated ORCID iD.</p>
<p>In preparing for the launch of this requirement, we tackled both technical and operational hurdles. But there were – and still are – behavioral changes needed. PLOS began capturing ORCID iDs in Editorial Manager in 2014. By the beginning of 2016 there were more than 27,000 authenticated iDs in our database. Throughout this year, we have actively engaged with our authors, editors and reviewers to encourage sign-ups; in addition to email campaigns and messaging in the submission system we have posted an <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">informational page</a></strong> on our web site, updated our <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-identification" target="_blank">author instructions</a></strong> and provided <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how-to videos</a></strong> to assist our contributors.</p>
<p>As of this week, we have upwards of 54,000 authenticated ORCID iDs, more than doubling the count in less than a year. We still have a long way to go, however, as there are many more in our database who have yet to register!</p>
<p><strong>How PLOS Uses ORCID IDs</strong></p>
<p>From early 2016, we have been passing authors’ iDs on published articles through to Crossref with our metadata deposits. Crossref, in turn, communicates that information to ORCID; if the author has agreed to allow for updates their ORCID profile is enhanced to include the new publication.

<p><strong>CRediT Implementation</strong></p>
<p>While ORCID allows us to know and unambiguously credit WHO participated in published articles, CRediT goes a step further and allows us to provide attribution for WHAT those individuals did in relation to the articles. Such attribution improves the ability of institutions and funders to more accurately evaluate researchers based on their actual contributions to published works, rather than by the journals in which those articles appear.</p>
<p>While PLOS has for many years required contributions for each of the named authors to any submitted work, in 2016 we <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">adopted the CRediT taxonomy</a></strong> of contributions. CRediT is a community-developed open standard intended to replace over time the many disparate lists – or free-text – that publishers have been using for this purpose. <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-contributions" target="_blank">More information</a></strong> is provided in our instructions for authors.</p>
<p>We are gathering data on how the CRediT taxonomy is being used by our authors and will be analyzing and sharing that out in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Progress in these two areas – uniquely identifying and crediting authors and gathering standardized author contributions – are major steps along the path of providing improved attribution and transparency in scholarly publishing. PLOS will continue to provide or adopt new tools and services that help accelerate the pace and transparency of scientific research and will <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/where-next-for-plos-working-together-to-make-waves-in-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">continue to collaborate with others</a></strong> to establish ways to speed publication, improve the author experience and advance standards for reporting and reproducing research.</p>

<p>It’s one of the simplest, most evidence-backed pieces of advice you can give to someone who’s looking to attract a partner – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/13/episode-1-dating-attraction/">wear red</a>. Many studies, most of them involving men rating women’s appearance, have shown that wearing red clothing increases attractiveness and sex appeal. The reasons are thought to be traceable to our evolutionary past – red displays in the animal kingdom also often indicate sexual interest and availability – complemented by the cultural connotations of red with passion and sex.</p>
<p>But nothing, it seems, is straightforward in psychology any more. A team of Dutch and British researchers has just published <a href="http://evp.sagepub.com/content/14/4/1474704916673841.full">three attempts</a> to replicate the red effect in the open-access journal <em>Evolutionary Psychology</em>, including testing whether the effect is more pronounced in a short-term mating context, which would be consistent with the idea that red signals sexual availability. However, not only did the research not uncover an effect of mating context, all three experiments also failed to demonstrate any effect of red on attractiveness whatsoever. <span id="more-15215"></span></p>
<p>The simple picture that red increases attractiveness, especially in the eyes of men viewing women, had already been muddied by <a href="http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/articles/652/">a large study published earlier this year</a> that tried to extend the red effect to the context of waitress tipping, but which found, contrary to expectations, that men gave smaller tips to female servers wearing red. Also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22947805">other</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558822">recent</a> papers found the red-attractiveness effect when red was compared with some colours but not others.</p>
<p>For the new research, Leonard Peperkoorn and his colleagues began by asking 206 young Dutch men (all were heterosexual except for two who described themselves as bisexual) to judge the attractiveness of a woman pictured on a dating site, as well as how much they wanted to have sex with her. The woman was shown wearing either a red, black or white shirt. Some men looked at the woman in the context of using the dating site to find a one-night stand, the others in the context of searching for a long-term partner. Regardless of context, the woman was not rated more attractive or sexually desirable when wearing red. Moreover, the men said afterwards that the colour of her clothing was the least significant factor in their judgments. In a second replication attempt, the same negative results were also found with a sample of nearly 200 heterosexual American men.</p>
<p>Next the researchers attempted a more direct replication of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100299X">a prior study</a> that demonstrated the red effect in the context of men recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website rating a woman as more sexually receptive when she was seen wearing a red shirt as compared with a white one. Importantly, Peperkoorn and his colleagues obtained the exact same study materials used in that earlier research and recruited 433 men via Amazon to rate the same woman – a sample size 17 times larger than that used in the original study. However, this time, the men did not rate the woman’s sexual receptivity (based on survey items like “this person is interested in sex”) any differently when she was wearing red than when she was wearing white, and this was true across different age groups and regardless of the men’s current relationship status.</p>
<p>Just as it is wise not to place too much faith in the findings from single studies, we should also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/07/episode-8-can-we-trust-psychological-studies/">interpret failed replications with caution</a>. These new null results do not mean there is no red effect, but they do raise questions about its robustness, and the possibility that there might have a been a bias in past research to publish positive results. A generous interpretation is that the red effect could be more significant in real interactions than in lab-based research using static photos, because the colour might influence the wearer to behave more flirtatiously, for example.</p>
<p>However Peperkoorn and his team made their own newfound scepticism apparent. “The lack of evidence for a red effect in our three experiments … leads us to question the robustness of the red effect in human mate preferences,” they said. They further pointed out that past evidence has tended to be based on small studies and they encouraged others to perform replication attempts with larger samples. “We argue … that if red has an effect on human mate preferences, then it is likely to be small,” they concluded.</p>

<p>Alcohol consumption ranks 5th among the 20 leading risk factors for global burden of disease and <em>BMC Public Health</em> has published an array of articles this year on harmful drinking. Theresa Marteau et al. carried out a study in an eating and drinking establishment in Cambridge, England, which reports the effects of wine glass size on wine sales. During the study, the size of wine glasses were <img alt="Wine" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8230" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/wine-300x201.jpg" width="300" />changed at fortnightly intervals and, over a 16-week period, the establishment alternated between the standard 300ml wine glass, to the larger 370ml and smaller 250ml glasses. Data showed that the volume of wine purchased was nearly 10 percent higher when sold in larger glasses compared to standard-sized glasses. Interestingly, Marteau et al. did not see the opposite effect when they switched to smaller wine glasses.  The results indicate that avoiding the use of large wine glasses could reduce the amount that people drink. However, more research is required to confirm the effect and, should this suggest glass size might be an effective target for intervention, the next step would be to explore how this might be implemented.</p>

<p><span class="AuthorName">Economic recessions are known to affect people’s health and wellbeing. </span><span class="AuthorName">Diana Frasquilho et al. have carried out a systematic review which looks at the recent evidence of the possible association between economic recessions and mental health outcomes. They found that, in general, evidence on the impact of economic crises and recessions on mental health is accruing, but comprehensive studies are lacking. Although periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behavior, most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences. Diana Frasquilho explains more about the review’s findings <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/09/mental-health-outcomes-times-economic-recession/">here.</a></span></p>

Surprisingly, the authors’ results reveal that groups one might presume to be the least psychologically motivated to look for this information, young adults and smokers, were more likely to say that they had previously looked for it. Furthermore, more than 80% of U.S. smokers reported intending to eventually quit smoking, suggesting that many smokers are in the contemplation stage of behavior change and would therefore benefit from greater access to constituent information. The researchers also asked respondents whether they had heard that each of 4 constituents are in cigarette smoke and found that, with the exception of nicotine, most people were largely unaware of what chemicals are present in tobacco products.</p>

<p>Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have a close and complex relationship which warrants research sometimes looking at these major public health problems in conjunction. Jamie Brown et al. looked at whether, at a population level, smokers who have recently attempted to quit smoking are more likely than other smokers to report lower alcohol consumption and trying to reduce their drinking.  A total of 31,878 adults in England were surveyed between March 2014 and September 2015 and the researchers found that smokers who reported attempting to stop within the last week had lower levels of alcohol consumption, especially bingeing, and were less likely to be classified as having higher risk alcohol consumption compared with those who did not report an attempt to quit smoking in the last week. Results indicate that smokers in England may be following best-practice advice to restrict their alcohol consumption during a smoking cessation attempt. However, due to the nature of the study, it is not clear whether the effects seen are due to reverse causation: ie, that the association between quitting and consumption is actually driven by people with lower alcohol consumption being more likely to attempt to quit smoking. In either case, the study findings have important implications for policy evaluation and justify a coordinated strategy on alcohol and tobacco control.</p>

Jing Ma et al. explored live-broadcast suicide in Chinese emerging adults and collected data on the suicide incidents, stages/process, participants and their behaviors. Findings revealed that important information can be obtained from accounts of these incidents, which could contribute to a better understanding of suicidal people, those who encourage suicidal behaviors in others, and, most importantly, how suicide could be prevented in an online environment.</p>

<p>In this study, Simon Moore and colleagues examine for the first time how people judge their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking whilst they are intoxicated in social drinking environments. The authors carried out breath alcohol testing of 1,862 people and asked a subset of them about their perceptions of their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking. Their results show that people base judgements regarding their drinking on how their level of intoxication ranks relative to that of others of the same gender around them, not on their actual levels of intoxication. These findings have implications for strategies looking at increasing the numbers of sober people in night time environments.</p>

Carri Westgarth and co-authors carried out a study examining the demographic and behavioral factors that contribute towards owners reporting having a strong sense of encouragement and motivation to walk provided by their dogs. They found that factors such as owning a larger dog, having an increased level of attachment to their dog, knowing their dog enjoys going for a walk, believing walking keeps dogs healthy and having high social support from family to go walking, were positively associated with both outcomes ‘dog encouragement to walk’ and ‘dog motivation to walk’. These factors may be targeted in future interventions to increase and maintain physical activity levels of both people and pets.</p>

<p>Yvonne Kelly and colleagues have found that UK 11-year-olds whose parents drink heavily are almost twice as likely to drink themselves than if their parents are non-drinkers – and particularly if their mother rather than their father is a heavy or regular binge drinker. Children who said their friends drank were also more than four times as likely to drink themselves as those children who had friends who didn’t drink. The researchers carried out an analysis of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 10,498 11-year-olds and results obtained suggest that their perceptions of risk, their expectancies towards alcohol and relationships with their families were independently related to the likelihood of drinking.

<p><img alt="Soda" class="size-medium wp-image-8231 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/soda-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are estimated to arise from agriculture and associated land use change and therefore changing food consumption patterns may contribute substantially to reducing these gas levels. However, in attempting to reduce the consumption of foods with high GHGEs, other unhealthy food products which are low in GHGEs, such as sugar, may be preferred by consumers. In order to promote foods with low GHGEs and, at the same time, mitigate the negative health consequences of choosing low GHGE foods, Adam Briggs et al. modelled the effect on UK non-communicable disease mortality and GHGEs of internalizing the social cost of carbon into the price of food alongside a 20% tax on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). Results of the study indicate that incorporating this cost into food prices has the potential to improve health, reduce GHGEs and raise revenue. Furthermore, the SSBs tax can alleviate negative health consequences. The study, which is the first of its kind, has laid the groundwork for future research which is needed on developing sophisticated price structures to optimize a healthy population diet that is low in GHGEs.</p>

<p>A number of studies have shown that deprived communities suffer substantively greater alcohol-related morbidity and mortality despite reporting average alcohol consumption similar to their richer counterparts. It is unclear why this is true and possible explanations behind the paradox include that deprived populations are exposed to other health challenges that interact with higher levels of alcohol consumption or there may be epidemiologically relevant differences in patterns of consumption and types of alcohol consumed. Mark Bellis et al. sought to assess the hypotheses behind this paradox by carrying out a national telephone survey with English adults. Questions examined factors including: current and historic drinking patterns, combined health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass), and under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special occasion drinking). The researchers found that, among more deprived drinkers, alcohol consumption is more likely to be combined with smoking and poor diet, suggesting a multiplicative effect. The research also identifies higher levels of current and past ‘binge drinking’ among some deprived drinkers, which is known to weaken the protective effects of low consumption on, for example, ischaemic heart disease. James Nicholls, a co-author of this work, explains more about the study’s findings in a blog <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/18/alcohol-harm-paradox-poor-increased-health-risk/">here.</a></p>

<p>There is an increasing amount of evidence connecting mental health and personality traits to coronary heart disease (CHD). Mikko Pänkäläinen et al. carried out an 11-year prospective cohort study and looked at levels of dispositional optimism and pessimism of the participants at baseline. They found that both men and women who died because of CHD were significantly more pessimistic at baseline than the others, whereas optimism did not seem to have any connection with mortality risk. The researchers conclude that, as pessimism levels can be measured easily and non-invasively, this might be a very useful tool together with the other known risk factors to determine the risk of CHD-induced mortality.</p>

<p>It’s popularly believed that left-handers are uncommonly blessed with talents like high intelligence or an artistic temperament, but this is a myth. In fact, some studies even show cognitive deficits in lefties (though other research has failed to confirm this) and in terms of their take-home salaries, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.4.193">surveys suggest</a> that left-handers lag behind the right-handed by as much as ten per cent, possibly indicating a difficulty in competing under commercial conditions. In a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164412">recent study</a> in <em>PLOS One</em>, Marcello Sartarelli from the Universidad de Alicante attempted to replicate this deficit under controlled laboratory conditions using a simulated labour market. Lefties actually competed more strongly than expected, but they also exhibited some intriguing performance quirks linked with personality that set them apart from the right-handed majority.</p>
<p><span id="more-15194"></span></p>
<p>Sartarelli recruited 432 people, eight per cent left-handers, to play a game that captured two aspects of labour market success: putting in the appropriate effort and cutting good deals. The game was complex, but boiled down to some participants offering employment contracts to pairs of other participants who played the roles of the “workforce” in the simulation.</p>
<p>Each workforce pair selected the contract that they thought would generate the best outcome for them. Each member of the pair then selected whether they would be a high-effort worker in attempting to fulfil the contract – which would run down their own resources, but hopefully result in higher overall returns – or put less in, and hope their partner would do the work. The combination of a wisely-chosen contract, and the right amount of effort to get it done well, was the key to succeeding and making money.</p>
<p>The researchers also asked the participants to complete a measure of their tendency to think things through rather than jump to conclusions (“the cognitive reflection test”) and unsurprisingly – given that this was a complicated bargaining game – the participants who came out a winner tended to score higher on this measure. Crucially, and contrary to expectations, the lefties scored as highly on this cognitive test as the right-handers and what’s more, they brought home as much bacon in the simulation.</p>
<p>But although overall performance was indistinguishable between left-handers and right-handers, Sartarelli found some intriguing interactions between personality and performance that were unique to the left-handed sample. The data showed them to earn more when more extraverted, and less when more neurotic, whereas the right-handed group – ten times as large, meaning that effects should be easier to detect – showed no such association between personality and earnings. This might suggest that left-handers fall into certain types, some of whom are well-suited to the kinds of decisions found in a labour market, some less so; further work will need to tease out this result. Sartarelli also found that on the whole, left-handers were more agreeable, and left-handed women slightly more extraverted, as compared with right-handers.</p>
<p>Given these results, what are we to make of the real-world finding that left-handed people suffer in earnings? Well, perhaps the less competitive left-handed personality profile – introverted and less emotionally stable – has negative effects that accumulate over the course of a career. Higher agreeableness <a href="http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/truth-about-nice-guys-mean-girls-and.html">is associated with lower earnings</a>, so this may play a part. Most intuitively to me, personality differences and other aspects of being left-handed may affect what people look for in a career, and in aggregate draw them away from certain higher-earning professions. On the basis of Sartarelli’s data, any of these avenues of research appear more plausible than the overly simplistic hypothesis that southpaws don’t have what it takes to excel in the marketplace.</p>

            <img alt="Credit: Govind Bhagavatheeshwaran, Daniel Reich, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/12/30805878966_19824f12fd_z-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p style="text-align: justify;">The hypothalamus is a brain region implicated in several vital functions such as feeding, thermoregulation, reproduction, stress and metabolic regulation. Dozens of hypothalamic neuropeptides have been shown to be involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight homeostasis. The extreme heterogeneity of these chemical signals and the complex sub-architecture of the hypothalamus participate in regulating homeostatic adaptations.<br />
Information about the body’s energy store is gathered by the arcuate nucleus (Arc), a small hypothalamic nucleus, and then transmitted to second order neurons, including ones localized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and others in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), to evoke hunger sensation and feeding behavior. Since the seminal study of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&amp;doptcmdl=Citation&amp;defaultField=Title%20Word&amp;term=Anand%5Bauthor%5D%20AND%20Hypothalamic%20control%20of%20food%20intake%20in%20rats%20and%20cats">Anand and Brubeck (1951)</a>, the LHA has been identified as the “<em>feeding center of the brain</em>”. However, the exact contribution of each hypothalamic nucleus remains poorly understood and far from fully explored.<br />
QRFP, a recently identified hypothalamic neuropeptide, has emerged as an interesting chemical signal in the LHA and adjacent regions. What is the function of this novel peptide?<br />
In a recent <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164716">PLOS ONE article</a>, Okamoto and colleagues from the Kanazawa University in Japan, decided to explore the functions of this neuropeptide. Here is what they found.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QRFP, feeding and energy homeostasis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To examine the physiological role of QRFP, the authors generated a transgenic mouse line (<em>Qrfp</em><sup>-/-</sup>) by replacing the entire prepro-QRFP sequence with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. Interestingly, under standard diet the body weight of <em>Qrfp</em><sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly lower than that of wildtype littermates. This phenotype was also maintained when the mice were exposed to high-fat diet, a protocol known to induce obesity and metabolic disorders. These experiments strongly suggest that QRFP may play a critical role in influencing feeding behavior and central energy homeostasis.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19061" style="width: 526px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/12/QRFP_1.png"><img alt="QRFP_1" class="wp-image-19061" height="170" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/12/QRFP_1-300x97.png" width="526" /></a>Localization of QRFP in the mouse hypothalamus (Okamoto et al., 2016)</figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two major neuronal populations that control food intake are the arcuate POMC and AgRP neurons. Taking advantage of the eGFP expression of QRFP-expressing LHA neurons, the authors observed that arcuate AgRP neurons were able to contact those cells, thus suggesting a synaptic link. Interestingly, “<em>the area of distribution of AgRP fibers in the hypothalamus overlapped with that of QRFP-positive neurons</em>”, say Kitaro Okamoto, the leading author of the study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QRFP: not only food but also mood</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, most substances that affect food intake show effects on mood and motivation simultaneously, and eating disorders are often accompanied by mood or behavioral disorders. To address whether QRFP may impact mood and emotional states, the authors conducted a battery of behavioral experiments to further elucidate this possibility. Using the elevated plus maze and the open field tests, two behavioral paradigms which rely on the aversion of rodents to open spaces, Okamoto and colleagues showed that genetic inactivation of the hypothalamic QRFP was able to induce anxiety and hypo-activity. “<em>Behavioral tests revealed that Qrfp null mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior</em>”, concluded Takeshi Sakurai<strong>, </strong>the senior author of the study. In agreement with this behavioral phenotype, QRFP receptors, notably GPR103A and GPR103B, are expressed in regions implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and mood. “<em>These observations</em>”, report the authors, “<em>suggest that QRFP exerts its activity through these regions, and this factor is likely to be involved in emotional aspects of feeding</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Science is not science without caveats</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It must be mentioned that QRFP peptides are not only expressed in the brain, but also in peripheral organs such as in adrenal cortex and adipocytes. “<em>Since our present mouse model is a conventional QRFP knockout, the peripheral actions of QRFP might also contribute to metabolic phenotype of these mice</em>”, cautiously add the authors. Indeed, future studies taking advantage of optogenetic/pharmacogenetic approaches might further reveal the central mechanisms by which QRFP promotes feeding and mood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there is need for further investigations, this study points to QRFP as a potential pharmacological target for metabolic as wells as emotional disorders, thus opening exciting hypotheses to be tested and verified in the near future.</p>

 NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats) belong to a large family of cytoplasmic sensors that regulate an extraordinarily diverse range of biological functions. One of these functions is to contribute to immunity against infectious diseases, but dysregulation of their functional activity leads to the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Cytoplasmic innate immune sensors, including NLRs, are central regulators of intestinal homeostasis. NLRC3 (also known as CLR16.2 or NOD3) is a poorly characterized member of the NLR family and was identified in a genomic screen for genes encoding proteins bearing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and nucleotide-binding domains. Expression of NLRC3 is drastically reduced in the tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer compared to healthy tissues, highlighting an undefined potential function for this sensor in the development of cancer. Here we show that mice lacking NLRC3 are hyper-susceptible to colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis. The effect of NLRC3 is most dominant in enterocytes, in which it suppresses activation of the mTOR signalling pathways and inhibits cellular proliferation and stem-cell-derived organoid formation. NLRC3 associates with PI3Ks and blocks activation of the PI3K-dependent kinase AKT following binding of growth factor receptors or Toll-like receptor 4. These findings reveal a key role for NLRC3 as an inhibitor of the mTOR pathways, mediating protection against colorectal cancer.

 Cells grow well only in a narrow range of physiological conditions. Surviving extreme conditions requires the instantaneous expression of chaperones that help to overcome stressful situations. To ensure the preferential synthesis of these heat-shock proteins, cells inhibit transcription, pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export of non-heat-shock transcripts, while stress-specific mRNAs are exclusively exported and translated. How cells manage the selective retention of regular transcripts and the simultaneous rapid export of heat-shock mRNAs is largely unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling RNA adaptor proteins Npl3, Gbp2, Hrb1 and Nab2 are loaded co-transcriptionally onto growing pre-mRNAs. For nuclear export, they recruit the export-receptor heterodimer Mex67–Mtr2 (TAP–p15 in humans). Here we show that cellular stress induces the dissociation of Mex67 and its adaptor proteins from regular mRNAs to prevent general mRNA export. At the same time, heat-shock mRNAs are rapidly exported in association with Mex67, without the need for adapters. The immediate co-transcriptional loading of Mex67 onto heat-shock mRNAs involves Hsf1, a heat-shock transcription factor that binds to heat-shock-promoter elements in stress-responsive genes. An important difference between the export modes is that adaptor-protein-bound mRNAs undergo quality control, whereas stress-specific transcripts do not. In fact, regular mRNAs are converted into uncontrolled stress-responsive transcripts if expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter, suggesting that whether an mRNA undergoes quality control is encrypted therein. Under normal conditions, Mex67 adaptor proteins are recruited for RNA surveillance, with only quality-controlled mRNAs allowed to associate with Mex67 and leave the nucleus. Thus, at the cost of error-free mRNA formation, heat-shock mRNAs are exported and translated without delay, allowing cells to survive extreme situations.

            <p>New research is challenging the idea that working memory helps us remembers things through sustained brain activity.</p>
<p>Instead, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found that our brains tuck less-important information away beyond the reach of the tools that typically monitor brain activity. The researchers then were able to bring that information back into active attention with magnets. </p>
<p>The research could eventually help people suffering from schizophrenia or depression, according to Dr. Brad Postle, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A lot of mental illness is associated with the inability to choose what to think about. What we’re taking are first steps toward looking at the mechanisms that give us control over what we think about.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Postle, most people feel they are able to concentrate on a lot more than their working memory can actually hold. It’s a bit like vision, in which it feels like we’re seeing everything in our field of view, but details slip away unless you re-focus on them regularly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The notion that you’re aware of everything all the time is a sort of illusion your consciousness creates. That is true for thinking, too. You have the impression that you’re thinking of a lot of things at once, holding them all in your mind. But lots of research shows us you’re probably only actually attending to — are conscious of in any given moment — just a very small number of things.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the study, the researchers conducted a series of experiments in which people were asked to remember two items representing different types of information — words, faces, and directions of motion — because they’d be tested on their memories.</p>
<p>When the researchers gave their subjects a cue as to the type of question coming — a face, for example, instead of a word — the electrical activity and blood flow in the brain associated with the word memory disappeared. But if a second cue came letting the person know they would now be asked about that word, the brain activity would jump back up to a level indicating it was the focus of attention.</p>
<blockquote><p>“People have always thought neurons would have to keep firing to hold something in memory. Most models of the brain assume that. But we’re watching people remember things almost perfectly without showing any of the activity that would come with a neuron firing. The fact that you’re able to bring it back at all in this example proves it’s not gone. It’s just that we can’t see evidence for its active retention in the brain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers were also able to bring the seemingly abandoned items back to mind without cueing their subjects. Using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to apply a focused electromagnetic field to a precise part of the brain involved in storing the word, they could trigger the sort of brain activity representing focused attention.</p>
<p>Additionally, if they cued their subjects to focus on a face (causing brain activity associated with the word to drop off), a well-timed pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation would snap the stowed memory back into attention, and prompt the subjects to incorrectly think that they had been cued to focus on the word, the researchers report:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We think that memory is there, but not active. More than just showing us it’s there, the TMS can actually make that memory temporarily active again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The study suggests a state of memory apart from the spotlight attention of active working memory and the deep storage of more significant things in long-term memory, according to Postle:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What’s still unknown here is how the brain determines what falls away, and what enables you to retrieve things in the short-term if you need them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Studying how the brain apportions attention could eventually influence the way we understand and treat some mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, in which patients focus on hallucinations instead of reality, and depression, which seems related to spending an unhealthy amount of time dwelling on negative things, he noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are making some interesting progress with very basic research. But you can picture a point at which this work could help people control their attention, choose what they think about, and manage or overcome some very serious problems associated with a lack of control.”</p></blockquote>

Women working in sex work are vulnerable to violence from multiple perpetrators –including their own intimate partners, customers, law enforcement, and pimps. Experiencing violence can lead to a range of detrimental health and mental health outcomes, including HIV/STI exposure, substance use, physical injuries, unwanted pregnancies, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicide.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 223px;"><img alt="Feliciano Guimarães" class="size-medium wp-image-8249" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/woman-213x300.jpg" width="213" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Feliciano Guimarães</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Researchers and practitioners have looked to microfinance programs as one approach to promote economic security and reduce sexual risk behavior of women working in sex work. However, concern exists about the impact of microfinance participation on women’s risk for violence. Some research studies have found that participating in microfinance programs heightens women’s risk for violence, while others have found that microfinance participation protects women from violence. The impact of microfinance participation on women’s experiences of violence appears to vary per the cultural context. Most of these prior studies focus on violence from intimate partners, but not have looked at the effect on violence from customers among women in sex work.</p>
<p>In our study, we implemented an HIV/STI risk reduction training with women working in sex work. With approximately half of these women (selected at random), we also provided a microsavings program. Microsavings refers to a branch of microfinance which focuses on helping low-income persons build savings for future use. We used a microsavings model instead of a microcredit (i.e. loan-based) model because we did not want to burden women with high loan repayment interest rates or foster over-reliance upon debt.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8246" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="www.moolanomy.com/" class="size-medium wp-image-8246" height="224" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/money-300x224.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">www.moolanomy.com/</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We tested the impact of participating in microsavings on women’s experiences of violence from their customers. When we compared the two groups (i.e. women who participated in only the HIV/STI training vs. women who participated in both the HIV/STI training and microsavings), we found that over time women in both groups experienced less violence from their customers. Before the program, 44% reported experiencing recent violence from their customers, compared to 12% of women 6 months after the program finished. However, participating in the microsavings program did not significantly impact women’s risk of paying partner violence even though this intervention was effective in transferring women’s income from sex work to other sources.</p>
<p>What can we learn from this study? One explanation for the reductions in violence in both groups is that women may have learned ways to protect themselves from violence from customers in the HIV/STI risk reduction training. Alternatively, it is possible that the provision of social support from peers and program staff could have contributed to this reduction in violence, as many women reported minimal support from social services and high levels of stigma prior to joining our program. The study demonstrates that it is possible to engage a vulnerable group of women in a microsavings intervention without increasing reported experiences of violence from customers.  With proper planning, it is possible to implement microfinance interventions with women in sex work without placing them at greater risk for experiencing violence. While more work remains, this study offers a critical step in understanding how to implement microfinance interventions while prioritizing women’s safety.</p>

<p>It feels like this year there has been a big increase in people’s tendency to make a show of their political allegiance, to believe passionately in the superiority of their chosen group’s position, and to be ultra-vigilant to any potential incoming slight or insult toward the group. This kind of behaviour shows signs of “collective narcissism”, which like individual narcissism, is characterised by outward confidence compensating for deep-rooted insecurity.</p>
<p>Collective narcissists say they believe that their group is special and superior, yet when asked what others think of their group, or when tested on implicit measures, such as how quickly they associate in-group symbols with positive words, there is evidence of collective doubt. Worryingly, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/per.2067/abstract">a series of new studies</a> in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em> shows how collective narcissism can foster inter-group conflict. The results suggest it is important that responsible politicians and journalists do what they can to prevent rather than encourage this dangerous group mentality.</p>
<p><span id="more-15011"></span></p>
<p>Across five studies, Agnieskzka Golec De Zavala and her colleagues surveyed hundreds of participants in Turkey, Portugal and Poland. The most important measure was of the participants’ feelings of collective narcissism, as revealed through their agreement with statements like “My [national] group deserves special treatment”; “I will never be satisfied until my group gets all it deserves”; and “If my group had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place”. The researchers found that high scores on collective narcissism tended to go hand in hand with feeling that one’s group had been insulted or derogated in some way, and in turn, wishing for direct or indirect revenge against the out-group.</p>
<p>For instance, after reading a news story about Turkey’s failure to become part of the EU, Turkish participants who scored highly in collective narcissism were more likely to say they interpreted this as a national humiliation, and were more likely to say they found pleasure in the EU’s recent economic woes.</p>
<p>After reading about the EU financial bailout of Portugal in 2011 (and related austerity measures seen by many as imposed principally by Germany), Portuguese participants who scored highly in collective narcissism were more likely to believe that Germany was a threat to Portugal (for example, believing that the EU legal system shows favouritism toward Germany), and in turn were more likely to express intentions to harm, injure, humiliate or intimidate Germans given the chance.</p>
<p>Other similar studies with Polish participants showed that high collective narcissism was related to finding a controversial film (about Polish pogroms) insulting, and wishing for revenge against the film-makers; and there were similar findings related to finding insult in an actor’s jokes at the expense of the Polish political system.</p>
<p>In all studies, collective narcissism was found to be the strongest, and in some cases unique, correlate of the likelihood of perceiving insults or humiliations towards one’s national group, and thence wishing for retribution. For instance, the researchers also measured individual narcissism but this did not have these same associations, possibly because individual narcissists tend to pick and choose group identities as and when they work in their favour. Note too that when separated from any signs of collective narcissism, a positive, patriotic (but not grandiose) attitude towards one’s national in-group actually acted as a buffer against perceiving insults and wishing for vengeance towards other groups.</p>
<p>Where does collective narcissism come from? This is only part of the story, but based on measures of participants’ self-esteem, there was some evidence that collective narcissism may act as a compensation for low individual confidence and low self-worth. Lacking confidence in themselves, people can find comfort in aligning closely with a larger grouping, and seeing this group as somehow special and great. In turn, they are then highly defensive of their chosen group’s status, ultra-sensitive to possible slights, and keen to derogate any threatening groups.</p>
<p>“The present results suggest that there will always be a proportion of the population, which is responsive to the framing of intergroup situations as insulting to an in-group,” the researchers said. “Such a framing is likely to mobilise support for hostile actions towards the alleged perpetrators of the imagined in-group offences.” For this reason, the researchers said that collective narcissism, as and when it arises, could be part of a dangerous social psychological process that fosters intergroup tensions and even extremist activities.</p>
<p>The new findings suggest that any politician who ferments in their followers a grandiose belief in the in-group, combined with encouraging them to believe the in-group is being insulted or slighted by others, is arguably fostering collective narcissism and sowing the seeds for future conflict and hostility. One positive way to intervene might be to see if collective narcissists can be encouraged to channel their envy and sensitivity toward constructively helping their in-group rather than harming out-groups.</p>
<p>“[B]etter understanding of the cultural, economic, educational or societal contexts that encourage versus discourage collective narcissism may inspire new ways to deescalate intergroup tensions and discourage radicalization towards intergroup violence,” the researchers concluded.</p>

Demonstrated benefits from pet ownership include reduced <a href="http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/12/6/236">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12271103">improved physical health</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12271173">increased social interaction</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11111505">reduced loneliness</a>. Loneliness and isolation are key concerns for those living with mental health problems and having <a href="http://www.clahrc-wessex.nihr.ac.uk/theme/project/37">a support network in place is important for living everyday life</a>. During difficult emotional periods people report losing relationships with friends and family as well as connections with valued activities which maybe difficult to reconnect with. Emphasis is often placed on the importance of family, friends and interaction with other people. However, the role of pets within this support network is relatively under explored.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We examined the role of pets within the personal communities of those living with a mental health condition by analyzing interviews with 54 participants, 25 of whom had a pet. Participants were asked to map personal networks using a diagram, which consisted of three concentric circles. Interviewers started the interview by asking <em>‘Who or what do you think is most important to you in managing your mental health?’</em></p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="pet-blog-image-cc-the-authors" class="aligncenter wp-image-8189 size-full" height="540" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Pet-blog-image-CC-The-authors.jpg" title="The Authors CC" width="720" />
<p>Participants could place network members in either the central circle considered most important, the middle circle, considered important but not as important as the central circle or the outer circle, considered important but not as important as the two more central two circles. Identified network members included friends, family members, health professionals pets, hobbies, places, activities and objects.</p>
<p>The majority of pets were placed in the central, most valued circle of support within network diagrams. Pets were of increased importance where relationships with other network members were limited or difficult.</p>

<p>Pets were implicated in the management of mental health through the provision of secure and intimate relationships not available elsewhere. Given the consistency of presence and a close physical proximity, pets were an instant source of calming, therapeutic support for their owners.</p>
<p><em>“So with my pets I suppose although my Mum and Dad are very significant figures they’ve also got their own lives and lots of other things going on so I’m only one aspect of that life and I feel that the pets I suppose they depend on me and also I have daily contact with them and they also give me a sense of wellbeing which I don’t get from any [one else] because most of these interactions with my Mum, Dad, [friend], are all by telephone rather than physical contact and that’s the big difference is the empathetic physical presence”. <strong>(ID 21, 10 birds, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I feel that the pets I suppose they depend on me and also I have daily contact with them and they also give me a sense of wellbeing which I don’t get from any [one else] </em></p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Pets helped their owners manage feelings by distracting them from symptoms and upsetting experiences such as hearing voices and suicide ideation and provided a form of encouragement for activity.</p>
<p><em>“But if I’m here and I’m having…having problems with voices and that, it does help me in the sense, you know, I’m not thinking about the voices, I’m just thinking of when I hear the birds singing” <strong>(ID 2, 2 birds, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants in this study had more difficult relationships with others and experienced greater levels of stigma than those included in a study exploring the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785224/">role of pets in the management of chronic physical conditions</a>.</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s hard really when you haven’t had mental illness to know what the actual experience is for someone who has had the experience. There’s like a chasm, deep chasm between us – a growing canyon. They’re on one side of it and we’re on the other side of it. We’re sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don’t always”.<strong> (ID 1, 1 cat, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s like a chasm, deep chasm between us – a growing canyon. They’re on one side of it and we’re on the other side of it. </em></p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Pets helped their owners to manage this stigma directly by providing acceptance without judgment.</p>
<p><em>“But he, his [the cat’s] love for me and acceptance of me never changed”. <strong>(ID 7, 1 cat, second circle)</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants described the various, different ways that pets connected them to others in, and beyond, their personal networks or to the wider social environment.</p>
<p><em>“You know, so in terms of mental health, when you just want to sink into a pit and just sort of retreat from the entire world, they force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved with the world”. <strong>(ID 5, 2 cats, first circle)</strong></em></p>

<p>Having two dogs myself, I can certainly identify with the characteristics attributed to pets in our study. I very rarely get down the road now without a neighbor or friendly stranger stopping to ask me about them and it’s true what they say that ‘there’s nothing better to come home to than a dog’s welcome’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was surprised though by the <em>range </em>and <em>depth </em>of roles pets played in the management of mental health problems from the perspectives of participants. Interestingly, for the people included in this study despite their potential value, pets were also not considered or included in discussions about their mental health care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Given that service users currently feel distanced from healthcare and uninvolved in discussions about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243762">services generally</a>, taking more creative approaches to service provision including the discussion of pets, may be one way of addressing this because of the value, meaning and engagement that individuals have with their pets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We think that our study provides the mental health community with possible areas to target intervention and potential ways in which to better involve service users in service provision through the discussion of valued experiences.</p>

            When you're doing two things at once - like listening to the radio while driving - your brain organizes itself into two, functionally independent networks, almost as if you temporarily have two brains.

<p>Imagine a person is terrified of dogs because they once suffered a terrible bite. Following long-established techniques, their psychologist might gradually expose them to dogs in a safe setting, until their fear gradually faded away. This “exposure therapy” can be effective but it has some serious drawbacks, including the fact that the person might at first find it traumatic to be close to dogs again.</p>
<p>What if there were a way to remove this person’s fear of dogs at a subconscious level, without the need for any traumatic exposure? Such an approach has now come much closer to clinical reality thanks to a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0006">new study</a> reported recently in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>. The findings suggest that neurofeedback can be used to unlearn a fear by pairing relevant non-conscious neural activity with a reward, such as money. Significant technical hurdles remain before this becomes a real-life treatment, but it’s an exciting breakthrough. <span id="more-14871"></span></p>
<p>Ai Koizumi at ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Japan and her colleagues trained 17 participants (11 men) to fear two colourful grating patterns presented on a computer screen by repeatedly pairing the patterns with safe but unpleasant electric shocks. Toward the end of this session, measures of the participants’ electrodermal response (skin sweatiness) to the sight of the two patterns confirmed that they now found them aversive. Prior to the fear-induction, the researchers had also scanned the participants’ brains while they looked at these two patterns, so the researchers knew what neural activity tended to accompany the mental representation of each one. After the fear-induction process, one of the patterns (the “target”) was chosen as the learned fear to be removed, the other acted as a control.</p>
<p>Next, over three days, the participants undertook several sessions of neural feedback training, during which the researchers monitored their brain activity. This involved the participants looking at a grey grating pattern and then trying to use any mental strategy they liked to try to get a small disc on the screen to increase in size. If the participants succeeded, they were rewarded with small amounts of money.</p>
<p>At the first session, the participants found this challenge impossible, but gradually and subconsciously they improved at the task. Unbeknown to the participants, their success was dependent on their displaying a particular form of brain activity (hence why this was a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback">neurofeedback</a> training). More specifically, what made the disc grow was the participants’ visual cortex exhibiting neural activity previously associated with representing the target grating pattern. In other words, whenever the participants’ brains showed non-conscious neural activity related to the target feared pattern – which they did occasionally – the disc grew, and they were rewarded with money.</p>
<p>During the training, the participants showed no experience of fear, either subjectively or based on their electrodermal response (the sweatiness of their skin), suggesting the fear-related brain activity was entirely non-conscious. And quizzed after the training, it was clear the participants had no idea what had been going on at a subconscious level – they didn’t know what they had been doing mentally to increase the disc size and receive money, and they didn’t know which grating they had been trained not to fear and which one was the control. So while the researchers were busy training the participants’ brains to like one of the patterns that they’d previously learned to fear, the participants themselves were blissfully ignorant of what was going on.</p>
<p>Of course the key test was what happened when, after the neurofeedback training, the researchers subsequently re-exposed the participants to the two colourful grating patterns. As hoped, the participants showed a much weaker fear response (again, based on their skin sweatiness) to the sight of the target grating, as compared with the control grating. In fact, the magnitude of this fear reduction was similar to that seen for conventional exposure therapy. The researchers also scanned the participants’ brains during this testing phase (as they had done during the fear-induction phase) and this showed that the participants’ amygdala activity was now lower in response to the target grating compared with the control grating. The amygdala is involved in fear processing so this provides more evidence that the fear-removal process had worked.</p>
<p>So what are some of the technical hurdles before this kind of approach reaches your local psych clinic? Let’s return to our imaginary individual who is terrified of dogs. For the subconscious neurofeedback training to work, we’d need to know what kind of brain activity pattern this person shows when she encounters dogs, in order that we could pair this activity, at a subconscious level, with a reward. But this dog-related brain activity will be more far more complex than the neural activity associated with a simple grating pattern on a computer screen. And to find out what it looks like, we’d of course need to scan the person’s brain while we exposed him or her to dogs – defeating the whole object of the cunning neurofeedback approach!</p>
<p>There may be a way around this, the researchers suggested – for example, by extrapolating from other people’s dog-related brain activity or by decoding dog-related brain activity based on showing our client subliminal dog images (I’m running with the dog example here but the same principles would apply whatever it is that a client feared). “Despite these challenges,” Koizumi and her colleagues concluded, “the present results hopefully represent an initial step towards a potential new avenue for treatment.”</p>

            <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinical therapy, involving the surgical
implantation of electrodes into disorder specific nuclei, used to treat
the symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson¹s disease and
essential tremor (ET). The mechanisms through which the electrical
stimulation leads to the observed clinical improvements remain unclear, to
the extent that it is unknown how stimulation changes neuronal excitation.
If we better understood these mechanisms, we could optimise the parameters
setting process and minimise unwanted side effects. To study the effect of
stimulation on the firing activity of axons, single neurons, and networks
of neurons, I take a multi-level computational modelling approach. First I
create a finite element model to calculate the distribution of electric
potential induced by DBS and then applied the potential as an
extracellular stimulus to multicompartment axon or neuron models. I have
previously shown that such models can reveal detailed spatial effects of
stimulation in the vicinity of the electrode. To study network level
changes, I model the network proposed to be involved in generating
pathological synchronous activity via a Wilson-Cowan approach. The
parameter space of such a model can be explored to uncover regions which
produced oscillatory thalamic activity in the typical ET frequency range
(4-12Hz). Taken together, these models demonstrate a method of
quantitatively assessing neuronal changes induced by DBS, to maximise
therapeutic benefit and minimise unwanted side effects.</p>

This means there are almost one billion people who face everyday inequality, marginalization, and discrimination through inequitable opportunities, as compared to persons without disabilities. Moreover, persons with psychosocial disabilities face disparate access to healthcare and social services worldwide, along with systemic discrimination, structural inequalities, and widespread human rights abuses. People with psychosocial disabilities face particularly acute social challenges and continue to be subjected to human rights violations worldwide. The stories of discrimination, mistreatment, and exclusion are harrowing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Approximately 15% of the world’s population lives with disabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, many people have looked to international human rights law to help address mental health challenges. On December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally adopted the landmark Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) – the first human rights treaty of the 21st century and the fastest ever negotiated.</p>
<h3><strong>CRPD implementation in Canada</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-016-0103-1">article</a> published in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> </a>assesses the CRPD’s potential impact on mental health systems and presents a legal and public policy analysis of its implementation in one high-income country: Canada. As part of this analysis, we undertook a critical review of the CRPD’s implementation in Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence related to mental health.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that while the CRPD remains conspicuously absent from Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence, the country’s ratification of the Convention (which took place on March 11, 2010) has facilitated an important shift in the social and cultural paradigms surrounding psychosocial disability in Canada. As a result, this new international human rights treaty may be aiding the everyday struggles of persons living with psychosocial disabilities – even in the wealthiest countries – by facilitating larger changes in social norms and expectations around such disabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Barriers to implementation</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>CRPD remains conspicuously absent from Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Convention is clearly an important step forward, there remains a divide, even in Canada, between the Convention’s goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Its implementation is perhaps hindered most by Canada’s reservations to Article 12 of the CRPD on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities.</p>
<p>The overseeing CRPD Committee has stated that Article 12 only permits “supported decision-making” regimes, yet most Canadian jurisdictions maintain their “substitute decision-making” regimes. This means that many Canadians with mental health challenges continue to be denied legal capacity to make decisions related to their healthcare, housing, and finances. But changes are afoot: new legislation has been introduced in different jurisdictions across the country, and recent court decisions have started to push policymakers in this direction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the success of the CRPD and other international laws related to mental health depends on the extent to which they are domestically implemented and followed by its state parties.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of explicit implementation, the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada. But mere ratification and passive implementation are not enough. Further efforts are needed to implement the CRPD’s provisions and promote the equal enjoyment of human rights by all Canadian citizens – and presumably for all other people too, from the poorest to the wealthiest countries.</p>

<p>We know from twin and family studies that our personality is to a large degree – probably around 40 per cent – inherited. Geneticists are busy trying to find the specific gene variants involved, but because each one on its own only exerts a modest influence, this is challenging research requiring huge samples. A <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3736.html">new study</a> in <em>Nature Genetics</em> has made a significant contribution, using the technique of Genome Wide Analysis to look for genetic variants that correlate with personality. The researchers led by Min-Tzu Lo at the University of California, San Diego have identified variations in six genetic loci that correlate with different personality trait scores, five of which were previously unknown. In a separate analysis, the researchers also showed that many of the genetic variants involved in personality overlap with those involved in the risk of developing mental health disorders.</p>
<p><span id="more-14758"></span></p>
<p>The researchers analysed the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people, including clients of <a href="https://www.23andme.com/en-gb/">23andMe</a> – a commercial service that promises to inform customers about their ancestry and health based on their DNA (usefully for present purposes, the company also asks its clients to complete personality questionnaires). Among the genetic loci the researchers identified as being linked with personality, the most influential correlated with Neuroticism scores and was on a region of chromosome 8 (specifically 8p23.1) that is known to be involved in nervous system development and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Another that was linked with extraversion scores was on a region of chromosome 12 (specifically 12q23.3) that has also been highlighted in genetic research into bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The researchers also compared the gene/personality correlations in their massive data sets with similar records previously obtained by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium to look for genetic influences on mental health disorders. This showed substantial genetic correlations between personality and psychiatric disorders – that is, many of the genetic influences on personality are also implicated in the risk of developing various mental health disorders. This makes sense given what we already know about the influence of personality on mental health – for instance, high scorers on Neuroticism are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, while high scorers on Extraversion and Openness to Experience are more likely than others to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The genetic findings largely matched this picture. For instance, in terms of shared genetic influences, the trait of Openness to Experience, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia tended to cluster together, as did Neuroticism and Depression, and Extraversion and ADHD.</p>
<p>Another test the researchers were able to do was to see what proportion of the variation in the participants’ personality traits could be traced to differences in their genome – in other words to estimate the genetic heritability for each of the Big Five traits. Based on an analysis of over one million genetic variants (<a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp">single-nucleotide polymorphisms</a>; SNPs) present in the 59,000+ clients of 23andMe, the researchers found that Extraversion was the most strongly heritable trait with 18 per cent of variation in this trait traceable to differences in the genome (the estimates for Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness were 8 per cent, 9 per cent, 11 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively). As expected, these heritability estimates for personality are lower than those found in twin and family studies – among the reasons for this is the fact the researchers were only able to look at a fraction of the genetic variants that may play a role in personality, and were unable to explore ways that genes interact with the environment.</p>
<p>The researchers said that overall their results are consistent with the idea that “maladaptive or extreme variants of personality may contribute to the persistence of, or vulnerability to, psychiatric disorders and comorbidity”. They ended with a note about keeping things in perspective. “Personality traits are probably influenced by many genetic variants and gene-environment interactions,” they said. “Researchers are only beginning to understand the  genetics of personality and their relation to psychiatric disorders.” In other words, these are important findings, but they are just one small piece in a growing genetic jigsaw puzzle that might one day contribute to improving people’s mental health.</p>

 The fact that the identity of the cells that initiate metastasis in most human cancers is unknown hampers the development of antimetastatic therapies. Here we describe a subpopulation of CD44bright cells in human oral carcinomas that do not overexpress mesenchymal genes, are slow-cycling, express high levels of the fatty acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, and are unique in their ability to initiate metastasis. Palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosts the metastatic potential of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent manner. The use of neutralizing antibodies to block CD36 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in immunodeficient or immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of human oral cancer, with no side effects. Clinically, the presence of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells correlates with a poor prognosis for numerous types of carcinomas, and inhibition of CD36 also impairs metastasis, at least in human melanoma- and breast cancer-derived tumours. Together, our results indicate that metastasis-initiating cells particularly rely on dietary lipids to promote metastasis.

 Chemokines and their G-protein-coupled receptors play a diverse role in immune defence by controlling the migration, activation and survival of immune cells. They are also involved in viral entry, tumour growth and metastasis and hence are important drug targets in a wide range of diseases. Despite very significant efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop drugs, with over 50 small-molecule drugs directed at the family entering clinical development, only two compounds have reached the market: maraviroc (CCR5) for HIV infection and plerixafor (CXCR4) for stem-cell mobilization. The high failure rate may in part be due to limited understanding of the mechanism of action of chemokine antagonists and an inability to optimize compounds in the absence of structural information. CC chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) activation by CCL25 plays a key role in leukocyte recruitment to the gut and represents a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease. The selective CCR9 antagonist vercirnon progressed to phase 3 clinical trials in Crohn’s disease but efficacy was limited, with the need for very high doses to block receptor activation. Here we report the crystal structure of the CCR9 receptor in complex with vercirnon at 2.8 Å resolution. Remarkably, vercirnon binds to the intracellular side of the receptor, exerting allosteric antagonism and preventing G-protein coupling. This binding site explains the need for relatively lipophilic ligands and describes another example of an allosteric site on G-protein-coupled receptors that can be targeted for drug design, not only at CCR9, but potentially extending to other chemokine receptors.

 CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of 19 members of the chemokine receptor subfamily of human class A G-protein-coupled receptors. CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and T-cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 (ref. 1). CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer. These disease associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials (see http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2–chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts, here we solve a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 (ref. 6)) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[R]) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA-[R] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed in class A G-protein-coupled receptors so far; this site spatially overlaps the G-protein-binding site in homologous receptors. CCR2-RA-[R] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the G-protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most inactive G-protein-coupled receptor structures solved so far. Like other protein–protein interactions, receptor–chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome obstacles in drug design.

 The Yorkie homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1), effectors of the Hippo pathway, have been identified as mediators for mechanical stimuli. However, the role of YAP/TAZ in haemodynamics-induced mechanotransduction and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains unclear. Here we show that endothelial YAP/TAZ activity is regulated by different patterns of blood flow, and YAP/TAZ inhibition suppresses inflammation and retards atherogenesis. Atheroprone-disturbed flow increases whereas atheroprotective unidirectional shear stress inhibits YAP/TAZ activity. Unidirectional shear stress activates integrin and promotes integrin–Gα13 interaction, leading to RhoA inhibition and YAP phosphorylation and suppression. YAP/TAZ inhibition suppresses JNK signalling and downregulates pro-inflammatory genes expression, thereby reducing monocyte attachment and infiltration. In vivo endothelial-specific YAP overexpression exacerbates, while CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Yap knockdown in endothelium retards, plaque formation in ApoE−/− mice. We also show several existing anti-atherosclerotic agents such as statins inhibit YAP/TAZ transactivation. On the other hand, simvastatin fails to suppress constitutively active YAP/TAZ-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells, indicating that YAP/TAZ inhibition could contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. Furthermore, activation of integrin by oral administration of MnCl2 reduces plaque formation. Taken together, our results indicate that integrin–Gα13–RhoA–YAP pathway holds promise as a novel drug target against atherosclerosis.

 Endogenous viral elements are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes, yet little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here we provide a compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defence system. We found that the virophage mavirus, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV), integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically similar to eukaryotic DNA transposons and endogenous viruses of the Maverick/Polinton family. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed, but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages can inhibit the replication of mimivirus-like giant viruses and an anti-viral protective effect of provirophages on their hosts has been hypothesized. We find that provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis of these cells releases infectious mavirus particles that are then able to suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival during subsequent rounds of infection. The microbial host–parasite interaction described here involves an altruistic aspect and suggests that giant-virus-induced activation of provirophages might be ecologically relevant in natural protist populations.

 Changes in gamma oscillations (20–50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)1–40 and Aβ 1–42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Aβ. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer’s-disease-associated pathology.

 The internal mechanics of proteins—the coordinated motions of amino acids and the pattern of forces constraining these motions—connects protein structure to function. Here we describe a new method combining the application of strong electric field pulses to protein crystals with time-resolved X-ray crystallography to observe conformational changes in spatial and temporal detail. Using a human PDZ domain (LNX2PDZ2) as a model system, we show that protein crystals tolerate electric field pulses strong enough to drive concerted motions on the sub-microsecond timescale. The induced motions are subtle, involve diverse physical mechanisms, and occur throughout the protein structure. The global pattern of electric-field-induced motions is consistent with both local and allosteric conformational changes naturally induced by ligand binding, including at conserved functional sites in the PDZ domain family. This work lays the foundation for comprehensive experimental study of the mechanical basis of protein function.

 The most prevalent route of HIV-1 infection is across mucosal tissues after sexual contact. Langerhans cells (LCs) belong to the subset of dendritic cells (DCs) that line the mucosal epithelia of vagina and foreskin and have the ability to sense and induce immunity to invading pathogens. Anatomical and functional characteristics make LCs one of the primary targets of HIV-1 infection. Notably, LCs form a protective barrier against HIV-1 infection and transmission. LCs restrict HIV-1 infection through the capture of HIV-1 by the C-type lectin receptor Langerin and subsequent internalization into Birbeck granules. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV-1 restriction in LCs remains unknown. Here we show that human E3-ubiquitin ligase tri-partite-containing motif 5α (TRIM5α) potently restricts HIV-1 infection of LCs but not of subepithelial DC-SIGN+ DCs. HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5α was thus far considered to be reserved to non-human primate TRIM5α orthologues, but our data strongly suggest that human TRIM5α is a cell-specific restriction factor dependent on C-type lectin receptor function. Our findings highlight the importance of HIV-1 binding to Langerin for the routeing of HIV-1 into the human TRIM5α-mediated restriction pathway. TRIM5α mediates the assembly of an autophagy-activating scaffold to Langerin, which targets HIV-1 for autophagic degradation and prevents infection of LCs. By contrast, HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN+ DCs leads to disassociation of TRIM5α from DC-SIGN, which abrogates TRIM5α restriction. Thus, our data strongly suggest that restriction by human TRIM5α is controlled by C-type-lectin-receptor-dependent uptake of HIV-1, dictating protection or infection of human DC subsets. Therapeutic interventions that incorporate C-type lectin receptors and autophagy-targeting strategies could thus provide cell-mediated resistance to HIV-1 in humans.

            Does non-ionizing radiation pose a health risk? Everyone knows that ionizing radiation, like gamma rays, can cause cancer by damaging DNA. But the scientific consensus is that there is no such risk from non-ionizing radiation such as radiowaves or Wi-Fi.

Yet according to a remarkable new paper from Magda Havas, the risk is real: it's called When theory and observation collide: Can non-ionizing radiation cause cancer?

            <p>What makes someone a psycopath? Nature or Nurture? And can we stop at risk children from growing up into dangerous adult psycopaths? One of the oldest queries in psychology — Nature Vs Nurture — asks if what makes us who we are is predisposed by our DNA, or by life experiences. It is a pretty poignant question when it comes to psychopaths, who are estimated to account for up to 50% of all serious crimes in the US. </p>
<p>Clinically known as anti-social personality disorder in the DMS-V, some troublesome psychopathic traits include:</p>
<p>• an egocentric identity<br />
• an absence of pro-social standards in goal-setting<br />
• a lack of empathy<br />
• an incapacity for mutually intimate relationships<br />
• manipulativeness<br />
• deceitfulness<br />
• callousness<br />
• irresponsibility, impulsivity and risk taking<br />
• hostility</p>
<p>Although these characteristics may be unpleasant, not all psychopaths are dangerous or criminals, and not all dangerous criminals are psychopaths. Counter-intuitively there are pro-social psycopaths too. Nonetheless, some psychopaths do pose a genuine threat for the safety of others.</p>
<p>The real unsolved problem when it comes to psychopathy is how to treat the personality disorder. Although certainly not to be considered impossible with the malleable brains we have even as adults, Dr. Nigel Blackwood, a leading Forensic Psychiatrist at King’s College London, has stated that adult psychopaths can be treated or managed, but not cured. Curing adult psycopathy is considered a near-impossible challenge. </p>
<p>Therefore, understanding when and how psychopathy develops from child to adult is an important part of the research engine that will hopefully identify what parents, caregivers and governments can do to prevent an at risk child from growing up to be a dangerous psycopath.</p>
<p><strong>Development of psycopathic personalities is mainly due to genes</strong><strong>  </strong></p><strong>
<p>Enter new psychopathy research published in <em>Development and Psychopathology</em> by lead author Dr. Catherine Tuvblad from the University of Southern California. Her research was a twin-based study designed to overcome many previous drawbacks and limitations. Ultimately, the study was designed to provide a more reliable indication of the extent to which genes or the environment, that is nature or nurture, is responsible for the development of psychopathic personality features as a child grows into a young adult.  </p>
<p>In the study, 780 pairs of twins and their caregivers filled out a questionnaire that allowed for measuring features of child psychopathy at ages 9–10, 11–13, 14–15, and 16–18. This included measuring psychopathic personality features indicative of future psychopathy, such as high levels of callous behavior towards peers and problems adhering to social norms.</p>
<p>The changes in the childrens’ psychopathic personality features between age groups was considered to be:</p>
<p>• 94% due to genetics between the ages of 9-10 and 11-13, and 6% environmental<br />
• 71% due to genetics between the ages of 11–13 and 14–15, and 29% environemental<br />
• 66% due to genetics between 14-15 and 16-18&lt;, and 44% environmental

This suggests that environmental factors may gradually play a greater part in changing the levels of psychopathic features a child develops in later teenage years, which is very promising for the development of future interventions for the prevention of psychopathy.

It should be noted that while the childrens' test results pointed to the environment around them becoming increasingly important to their psycopathic behavior, their parents almost exclusively thought that the psycopathy they observed in their children was purely genetic. Considering parents are largely responsible for their child's environment, its not that surprising. 

<strong>Nurture is important at key developmental stages in psychopathy development</strong></p>
<p>The analysis also revealed that there may be a key turning point in the development of psychopathy during the age range studied. The authors considered this turning point to be caused by the onset of puberty, when gene-environment interactions that are highly significant in inhibiting or promoting the development of psychopathy are at play. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the data also indicates that if these rapid gene-environment based changes in psychopathic traits occur early on (e.g. 11-13), any later additional environmental changes to psychopathic traits would be minimal. In other words, once the psychopathic personality traits are set during puberty, they tend to last into later years.</p>
<p>Other research has found that there may be other key turning points on route to becoming a psychopath much earlier in life. One study found that the total number of early negative life events between the ages of 0-4 were positively correlated with the emotion-based aspects of psychopathy. The findings suggest that early environmental factors could have important implications for the development of psychopathic traits and may also impact attachment to parents for children with genetic potential for psychopathy.</p>
<p>So although psychopathy is largely genetic, where it’s mostly down to if you have the right combination of genes needed to become a psychopath or not, life experiences during puberty and early infant years could make or break a potential psychopath. </p>
<p><strong>The cure for psychopathy is love?</strong></p>
<p>So what does science suggest as a successful environmental antidote to developing psychopathy? Believe it or not, love!</p>
<p>One neuroscientist, Dr. James Fallon, made a shocking discovery that on paper he is a psychopath. For example, he had a version of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene that is linked with violent crime and psychopathy. Also known as the warrior gene, MAOA encodes an enzyme that affects the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>His brain scans also resembled those of a psychopath. He had low activity in certain areas of the frontal and temporal lobes linked challenges with empathy, morality and self-control. In his family tree, there were also seven alleged murderers. </p>
<p>Although Dr. Fallon, in his own words, is obnoxiously competitive, kind of an asshole and won’t even let his grandchildren win games, he was certainly not a dangerous psychopath. So why not? His genes and even his brain screamed potential for antisocial psychopathy.</p>
<p>His answer was that the love he received from his mother led to him becoming a pro-social psycopath. And a newly published study tends to agree with him. OK love in itself is not enough. But, how a mother expresses that love in guiding the child’s pro-social behavior and in setting good examples of pro-social behavior might be the real key.</p>
<p>A new discovery coming from research on adopted infants suggests this is the case. Researchers found that the development of one of the largest child risk factors for psychopathy, that is highly heritable from biological mothers with severe antisocial behaviors — callous-unemotional behavior — was inhibited by high levels of positive reinforcement at 18 months by the adopted mother. </p>
<p>Further research will hopefully identify a whole repertoire of ways parents, schools and governments alike can lovingly nurture the development of at risk children through these key developmental stages. Ultimately, this could stop a large amount of future violent criminals literally in their diapers, before they even start.</p>

<p><em>Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare, Delan Devakumar, and Stephen Allen</em></p>
<p>Health professionals in low-income countries spend much of their professional lives dealing with the consequences of deficiencies in human rights for children, but have little influence over many factors that impact on this. Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare et al. discussed a framework in their article within which healthcare workers can carry out an audit and be agents for change at a local level. Looking at basic rights such as access to clean water, sanitation, food, shelter, education, and health, O’Hare et al. notified that such audits can provide information on the proportion of children living in a catchment who do not have access to their basic rights, and achieve several objectives. Aside from raising awareness on basic human rights and their importance to health, the audits could give the healthcare worker an informed voice to advocate at forums such as district councils, and legitimise their role as agents for change. Results could also help negotiations with international and non-governmental organizations that often arrive in a district with a predetermined set of objectives.</p>

<h3><strong>Maternity care and Human Rights: what do women think?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg, Fleur Lambermon, Cees Hamelink, and Tarek Meguid</em></p>
<p>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg et al. explored women’s perspectives and experiences of maternal health services through a human rights perspective in Magu District, Tanzania. By conducting 36 semi-structured interviews with 17 women, a series of important themes emerged surrounding the topic of maternity care. These included dignity, autonomy, equality, and security. Miltenburg et al. concluded that while Tanzanian women are aware that substandard care was present, the same women are able to voice what basic human rights principles mean to them as well as their desired applications in maternal health service provision.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence against women engaged in sex work</strong></h3>
<p><em>Laura Cordisco Tsai, Catherine E. Carlson, Toivgoo Aira, Andrea Norcini Pala, Marion Riedel, and Susan S. Witte</em></p>
<p>Women who engage in sex work are at risk of experiencing violence from numerous perpetrators, including paying partners. Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. moved away from existing literature, which looks at the impact of microfinance interventions on women’s experiences of intimate partner violence, and towards the impact of microfinance among women engaged specifically in sex work and at risk of violence from paying partners. Looking at Mongolia as a case study, Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. concluded that participation in a microsavings intervention did not reduce exposure to paying partner violence despite it reducing the reliance on sex work from income in participants. This is contrary to previous studies that have found microfinance participation to be protective from violence and follow up work is needed to better understand the reasons for this.</p>

<h3><strong>Mental Health Laws and Policies in High-Income Countries</strong></h3>
<p><em>Steven J. Hoffman, Lathika Sritharan, and Ali Tejpar</em></p>
<p>Steven J. Hoffman et al. questioned to what extent the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has an impact on high-income countries. Using Canada as a case study, Hoffman et al. concluded that there remains a divide between the Convention’s goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Canada’s reservations to the CRPD are seen most prominently through Article 12, on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities. Though a divide between Canadians and the CRPD does exist, Hoffman et al. remarked that the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada, seen through new legislation in various jurisdictions.</p>

<h3><strong>Criminalization of in-call venues and managers on migrant sex workers</strong></h3>
<p><em>S. Anderson, K. Shannon, J. Li, Y. Lee, J. Chettiar, S. Goldenberg, and A. Krüsi</em></p>
<p>Our final article by S. Anderson et al. looked at the correlation between the impact of criminalization and policing of managers and in-call establishments on HIV/STI prevention among sex workers. Drawing on 46 qualitative interviews with migrant sex workers, managers and business owners, Anderson et al. concluded that criminalization and policing undermine the health and human rights of migrant sex workers working in in–call venues. Criminalization limits the sex workers access to free contraception, sexual health information, and HIV/STI testing. Looking at these results as part of the wider context, this research supports growing evidence-based calls for the decriminalization of sex work in general.</p>

<p>To maintain pleasant public spaces requires that we all implicitly agree to certain civil behaviours, like pocketing our chocolate wrappers rather than leaving them strewn on the pavement, or turning the stereo down after eleven. But when these implicit agreements are too frequently ignored they can lose their force entirely, jeopardising the social order. To keep things together, one or more of us need to hold any miscreants to account… but who wants that hassle? A <a href="http://rss.sagepub.com/content/28/3/299">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Rationality and Society</em> explores real-life littering norm enforcers, taking us from the streets of Switzerland to the New York underground.</p>
<p><span id="more-14735"></span></p>
<p>The sociologists Joël Berger and Debra Hevenstone convened at various crowded city transit stops, and waited for a transit service (a tram in Bern, Switzerland or a New York subway train) to deposit a load of commuters. Then one researcher would perform an act of littering in front of the commuters, tossing an empty bottle near, but not into, a rubbish bin, while the other researcher observed how people responded.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone were particularly interested in whether there would be any instances of social sanctioning – that is, a commuter directly confronting the offending researcher – an act also sometimes labelled “costly punishment”, because the individual has to inconvenience themselves to enforce the social rules. Social sanctioning has been studied frequently in laboratory conditions but only rarely in “the wild”.</p>
<p>Replicating one of the few examples of previous field research on littering, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292112001316">conducted on the streets of Athens</a>, Berger and Hevenstone found that littering provocations did produce measurable responses in bystanders, although at lower levels than those found in the lab, and that passive-aggressive grumbles outnumbered direct confrontation. The research also revealed two further factors that affected the likelihood of commuter intervention: context and culture.</p>
<p>Any performance needs a set, and in this case the researchers alternated between two: sometimes trashing up the bin’s surroundings by arranging refuse bags around it, and in other cases making it as pristine as possible. In grubby surroundings, less than three per cent of littering events were met with a direct challenge – “Are you going to pick that up?” – versus nearly eight per cent in a clean environment. The environment had an even greater influence on whether bystanders tidied up after the loutish experimenter – in 16 per cent of cases when clean, but little more than 1 per cent when grubby. This effect calls to mind the (still controversial) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/12/23/signs-of-petty-crime-such-as-litter-and-graffiti-really-do-encourage-more-serious-law-breaking/">Broken Windows</a> criminology theory, which argues that run-down environments encourage further violations because potential perpetrators reckon their actions will go unpunished. The new research suggests that while violations may go up in run-down environments, challenges to violations may also go down, truly the ingredients for a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>As well as local conditions, cultural factors appeared to play a role. In Switzerland, nearly half of acts were met with some kind of response – a quarter of cases by subtle disapproval (head-shaking or muttering to friends), tidying up in 13 per cent of cases, and a direct intervention in 10 per cent of cases. Meanwhile in New York, the rates were always lower – only a third of cases provoked a reaction, with direct intervention four per cent of the time.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone recount an anecdote: “in Bern, we even had difficulties in maintaining the litter condition. Twice people wanted to remove the bag of garbage. This never happened in NYC.” As Bern is a lot smaller than New York, they made another run in larger Zürich to see if it resembled the American city, but the data showed Zürich inhabitants even more likely to tidy up the bottle at 26 per cent, and similar to Bern in rates of direct action (subtle disapproval wasn’t measured in this study). The Zürich findings suggest a national tidiness culture rather than a size of city effect.</p>
<p>This fieldwork bears out the idea that city inhabitants care enough about their environment to intervene when someone makes it worse… sometimes. That sometimes becomes a seldom when conditions have already deteriorated. If that applies to your neighbourhood, and you care enough to do something about it, you may need to invest energy to turn things around, so that others become re-engaged with policing the quality of their environment. Sometimes, you need to start with a clean sweep.</p>
