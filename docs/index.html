                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Orienting yourself through Python</a></h4>

<p>I was surprised by the amount of positive response to my <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">last article on transitioning away from Matlab</a>. Many people are ready to switch – but they’re facing some significant challenges. One of the biggest things I’ve heard beginners say is that they are overwhelmed with the number of choices they have to make with Python. Python is open-source, has a decentralized contribution model, and has been around for more than 25 years. For everything that you can do one way in Matlab, there are at least 10 different ways of doing it in Python. Picking the best one is stressful!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>This is my rough guide to orienting yourself with Python. Don’t read it all in one go, it will make your head spin! The goal is not to overwhelm you with information, but to have this information as a reference when you’re ready to use it. The recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences. They’re written with the intent of minimizing the amount of research and pain you’ll have to go through as a beginner. Don’t agree? Post in the comments! Feedback is a gift.</p>
<h4>Which distribution should I choose?</h4>
<p>The Python distribution on the python.org website <em>does not</em> include a lot of core packages needed for data science. It also does not include a package manager. A package manager allows you to automatically download and install a set of scripts and modules of a specific version – a package. People recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">the Anaconda distribution</a>, which is more fully-featured. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.</li>
<li><code>ipython</code>, the interactive python console.</li>
<li>The <code>conda</code> package manager. Note that conda and the Anaconda distribution are two different (though similarly named) things.</li>
<li>Many of the core packages needed for data science.</li>
<li>An installer that sets your path correctly, which is especially important on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should pick the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">latest stable version of Python 3 that conda comes in, in its 64-bit incarnation</a>. Python 2 has been deprecated for several years, and you should not be using it.</p>
<h4>Which package manager should I use?</h4>
<p>When you try to install packages like <code>tensorflow</code> and <code>pytorch</code>, you’ll quickly find that there are often two ways to install the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip</code>: the lightweight package manager. Originally pip could only install Python packages, but these days it can install non-Python system-wide dependencies to Python packages.</li>
<li><code>conda</code>: the heavy-duty package manager. It’s not just for Python, it’s for everything! This includes Python packages with weird dependencies, R and Julia packages, text editors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, packages will tell you how you should install them. Just follow the instructions. In either program manager, the process is similar: open the command line, type in a command, for example:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pytorch
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<p><code>conda install pytorch</code></p>
<p>Then confirm, and wait for the install to finish. No need to set the path or anything. Generally, I find that conda is slower but it can install a wider range of things.</p>
<h4>Where should I install my packages?</h4>
<p>When you install a package in Python, you can either install it in the base (or root) environment or in a custom environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re coming from the Matlab world, you know all the annoyances that come with managing the path. Imagine removing the path and replacing it wholesale when you switch projects. That’s sort of what environments do in Python. Another metaphor you might like is a virtual machine or a container. It’s a little sandbox in which you can put packages. If you bonk your environment, you delete it and create a new one. No need to reinstall your computer!</p>
<p>There are a few different environment managers, but since you installed Anaconda (above) and you have <code>conda</code> installed, you want to use <code>conda</code> environments. When you get started, you can put everything in the <code>base</code> environment. Later on, you’ll find this limiting (maybe you’ll have messed up your install with incompatible dependencies after a bit), so you’ll create another environment, perhaps called <code>py3</code>. Later still, you might start creating one environment per project (with its own Github repo!).</p>
<p>Packages that have very specific sets of dependencies will sometimes ask you to recreate an environment <em>exactly</em>. In that case, follow the instructions to the letter; the package probably needs an old version of a package or has esoteric system-wide dependencies that you will waste hours trying to track down. <a href="https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md">One package that requires this is DeepLabCut</a>.</p>
<h4>Which packages should I install?</h4>
<p>Many of the packages included by default in anaconda are your standard bread-and-butter for data science, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these packages has millions of users, they are very active and they’re supported by grants and commercial entities. You can rely on them. I also list <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">well-supported packages for neuroscience</a> in the previous article.</p>
<p>What about more esoteric needs? How do I intuit whether I’m going to waste a bunch of time on a package that doesn’t work? Here are a few heuristics:</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><ul>
<li>How many stars does it have on Github (1 in the above picture)? If it has 1k+ stars, it’s a very well-used project. If it’s smaller than 100 – beware.</li>
<li>When is the last commit on Github (2 in the above picture)? If it’s more than a year, chances are the package is abandoned. This may make it difficult to install.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask! Ask your labmates, on Twitter, on your favorite Discourse or at a local meetup. Use whatever everybody else is using – this way, it will be easier to get support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which IDE should I use?</h4>
<p>There are two categories of integrated development environment for Python:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code editors. You edit code that you can run from inside the editor. Code editors will have a file explorer, variables explorer, a plotting window, a console window, a graphical debugger, etc. These programs can approximate more or less faithfully the experience you have with Matlab. In some cases, they offer many, many more features. They run as standalone programs on your computer.</li>
<li>Notebook editors. You edit a visual document consisting of cells that can be run in any arbitrary order. Plots are saved inline and code can be interspersed with formatted text and formulas. Notebooks run inside in your browser and can connect to remote workers (Python doesn’t have to be on your computer, it can be in the cloud).</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked on Twitter what people tend to use, and it’s fairly evenly split. Many commented that they use both code editors and notebook editors in their day-to-day work. If I want to train a deep neural net for example, I might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script in a code editor, testing it on toy data with the built-in command line</li>
<li>Run the script inside of a terminal overnight</li>
<li>Analyze the results inside of a notebook the next day.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019">Here is a very good article that weighs all the different options</a> – it’s long! Here is my current hot take:</p>



<ol><li>Code editors: <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder is the most bare-bones IDE of the bunch, and approximates Matlab well</a>. It’s a great starter IDE. I love Atom in general but I find <a href="https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html">Hydrogen</a>‘s lack of a console limiting. I prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python">the Python extension</a>. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is by far the most advanced editor, with intelligent inferences on your code and automated fixes that feel like magic. It can also be overwhelming because it has so many features, and it also isn’t free (a license is 89$ a year). If you spend 8 hours a day doing Python, PyCharm might the editor for you.</li><li>Notebook editors: <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyterlab</a> does everything jupyter does and more. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true">Colab</a> adds sharing capabilities, and you can use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/colabs">free-tier TPU</a> with it.</li></ol>



<h4>Which GUI toolkit should I use?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7290" data-attachment-id="7290" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gui-toolkits" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png" data-orig-size="1030,526" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/gui-toolkits/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" /></figure>



<p>I asked on Twitter recently, and it seems that many people are choosing <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQt5</a> to build desktop applications. Qt has a very nice builder to graphically design your GUI, as well as code generators to eliminate writing your own boilerplate. wxPython is also well-loved for larger-scale applications, while tkinter doesn’t have quite all the knobs and options you’d want for a fully-fledged app.</p>



<h4>PyTorch or Tensorflow?</h4>



<p>That’s a tough one! I’ve worked with both in a professional setting at Google and Facebook. As an end-user, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is generally considered to be easier to use. <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> has a lot of support for advanced features, like probabilistic programming, and is used by downstream libraries for this reason, for example in the up-and-coming PyMC4. If you use Tensorflow, you probably want to start with <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, which has a higher-level API.</p>



<h4>What about plotting? How do I make nice figures?</h4>



<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><code>matplotlib</code> is the package that most people start with</a>. Its API is very similar to Matlab, by design. It creates plots which are not very aesthetically pleasing, by default, but <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html">you can easily improve them by using seaborn’s styling</a>:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()  # From now on matplotlib will use the seaborn theme.
</pre>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" /><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" data-attachment-id="7295" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aesthetics_7_0" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=370" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" data-orig-size="370,248" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/aesthetics_7_0/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_9_0.png" />Matplotlib plot before and after seaborn styling</figure>



<p>Many other packages build on <code>matplotlib</code>, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><code>seaborn</code></a>, which includes a number of useful plot types, including violin plots and histograms.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine"><code>plotnine</code></a>, which implements the grammar of graphics (<code>ggplot2</code> in R).</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of up-and-coming visualization libraries that are not using matplotlib under the hood. The one with the most support behind it is <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py">plotly</a>. It creates interactive plots that can be shared easily, includes support for other languages outside of Python, and is supported commercially by the plotly company.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Picking up Python can feel overwhelming as an outsider – so many decisions to make! I was endlessly reading through articles and doing comparison shopping when I was starting out. Picking what others around you are already using will help you get support when you’re starting out. Ask around! Enjoy the ride!</p>

<p><strong>The idea that the brain operates like a computer is the latest in a long line of metaphors that scientists have used to try and understand how the organ works.

<p><strong>What does it mean to “recover” from a mental illness?</strong> Although common scales used to measure recovery can determine whether someone’s symptoms have improved, research suggests that they’re not that great at gauging more general improvement in people’s everyday lives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/mental-health-depression-recovery.html">writes Benedict Carey</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>More on the problem of AI emotion recognition this week, with a </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00507-5"><strong>feature by Douglas Heaven</strong></a><strong> at <em>Nature</em>. </strong>Psychologists argue over whether particular emotional expressions are universal, and debate how much can be read into someone’s internal state from their face alone. But there’s one thing that many agree on: there are still big question marks around the use of automated algorithms to detect people’s emotions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Automated surveillance and facial recognition may also affect the way we think about ourselves. </strong>When people are observed, they see themselves “as if under a magnifying glass”, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-cameras-in-public-spaces-might-change-how-we-think-132537">writes Janina Steinmetz</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. People who are observed by cameras while eating feel like they have consumed larger portions, for instance, while people doing tests in front of others think they make more mistakes than unobserved test-takers. Cameras are becoming more and more common in public spaces,  Steinmetz writes,  but “we are only beginning to understand some of the psychological consequences of increased observation”.</p>

<p><strong>A new study has found that the brain processes the lyrics and the melody of songs in opposite hemispheres, </strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/27/810049050/how-the-brain-teases-apart-a-songs-words-and-music?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=science">reports Jon Hamilton</a> for <em>NPR</em><strong>.  </strong>Researchers asked participants listen to a capella songs while having their brains scanned. Some songs were manipulated to remove frequency information, so that the melody was not recognisable but the speech remained; others were changed to remove information about the way sounds changed over time, so that the melody remained but the speech was no longer recognisable. The team found that speech was processed in the left auditory cortex and melody in the right.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There are lots of differences between those who express opposing political affiliations — and they may not just be ideological. Liberals and conservatives have different shopping habits, for instance, with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/45/2/227/4827909">one series of studies</a> finding that liberals preferred products that made them feel unique, whilst conservatives picked brands that made them feel better than others. They even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619303910">view health risks differently</a> when they’re choosing what to eat.</p>
<p>But could there also be physiological differences between liberals and conservatives? Some evidence seems to suggest this might be the case, though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/12/conservatives-might-not-have-a-more-potent-fear-response-than-liberals-after-all/">as we reported earlier this month</a> past findings, such as differences in physiological responses to fear, may not be as solid as previously thought. However, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619895284">new research</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>has found that people of different political affiliations may differ in another way: where in the body they feel emotions relating to moral concerns.<span id="more-39227"></span></p>
<p>It’s well established that we feel particular emotions in the body — butterflies in the stomach when we’re nervous or excited, a racing pulse or flushed cheeks when we get angry. But these physical reactions are not uniform: where one person might feel disappointment in their chest, another may feel it in their stomach.</p>
<p>To examine how political ideology impacts such physiological differences, Mohammad Atari and a team from the University of Southern California asked 596 participants to read a piece of writing about a violation of a particular moral foundation. Participants were assigned to either read about a violation of morals relating to care, fairness, loyalty, authority, or purity. For example, one such vignette in the care condition read “You see a woman clearly avoiding sitting next to an obese woman on the bus” or, for the purity condition, the rather more surreal statement “You see an employee at a morgue eating a pepperoni pizza off of a dead body”.</p>
<p>Participants rated how morally wrong they felt the action described was, and also rated the strength of their emotional response. Then, presented with a map of the body, they were asked to colour in body regions they felt had become more activated (activity becoming stronger or faster) or deactivated (activity becoming weaker or slower).</p>
<p>Participants were also given a political orientation score based on how they rated their affiliation with the Republican or Democratic parties as well as their self-reported conservatism on a scale from “very liberal” to “very conservative”.</p>
<p>The results from this, and a second study aimed at replicating findings, suggest that liberals and conservatives do indeed feel moral outrage in different areas of their bodies — though in fairly concentrated areas. Liberals, for example, appeared to feel violations of “purity” in their groin area, whilst conservatives felt it in their stomach and heads; liberals were also more likely than conservatives to feel violations of “care” in their heart. This image shows the maps for each kind of moral concern:</p>

<p><span>These differences may not be as strong as they appear at first glance, however: activation was not as disparate as it might have been. Violations of “care” were felt largely in the head for both groups, “authority” in the head and chest for both, and “loyalty” in the same areas, for instance.      </span></p>
<p>The new study also comes after recent research that has seemed to debunk many claims of physiological differences between liberals and conservatives: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/27/no-conservatives-dont-experience-feelings-of-disgust-any-more-than-liberals/">one study</a> found that conservatives don’t in fact experience any more disgust than liberals, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/12/conservatives-might-not-have-a-more-potent-fear-response-than-liberals-after-all/">another</a> found that physiological differences in fear response between those with different ideologies had been overstated.</p>
<p>This work doesn’t quite claim the opposite — as the authors note, “there are more commonalities than differences”. And it also relies on people’s self-reported perceptions, rather than actual measures of physiological change in the body. But those differences could be significant, and may be worth a further, closer look.</p>

What carers need and how technology can help provide it</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Support_5504-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Family carers are often invisible to the health care system in meeting the care needs of older people. Yet, family carers – people who assist a family member or friend with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging – <a href="https://healthcouncilcanada.ca/files/HCC_HomeCare_FA.pdf">provide three-quarters of the care older adults receive</a>. Demands on family carers are <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/Q326-4625-5753-K683">increasing</a> as populations age, disability rates increase, and demands on our health and continuing care sectors escalate. In these circumstances, sustainability of family care becomes a pressing issue.</p>
<p>To better understand family caring roles, and how technology might support them, we conducted focus groups and an online survey with carers in Canada. As reported in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we learned that family carers want to enhance the care they currently provide, but they recognize that they have to protect their own capacity to care first.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting family carers’ well-being</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11737 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/2_0020-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To protect their own well-being, and their ongoing capacity to provide care, family carers want to take better care of themselves, develop better coping strategies, and have opportunities for mentorship and socialization.</p>
<p>Family carers sought more time and space for themselves as part of their overall sustainability. <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/ijcc/2019/00000003/00000003/art00009">Sustainability </a>in this context refers to carers’ ability to balance the demands of caring for their loved ones without jeopardizing their own health, well-being, and quality of life. This is easier said than done as carers struggle to find a few hours to care for themselves as individuals with their own interests and needs while caring for others. Developing better coping strategies and becoming more resilient is a learned skill. Rebalancing the negative and positive aspects of caregiving, focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress, and celebrating small victories can help reframe the emotional experience of caregiving. As one carer put it,</p>
<p><em>“If caregivers had time off, their health would hopefully remain good. Currently, burnout and health implications are inevitable.”</em></p>
<p>Yet, at times, family carers feel guilty about putting their own needs first. They want <em>“better networking with other caregivers, sharing our stories to make things easier,” </em>and reducing the social isolation they often experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhancing family carers’ capacity to provide quality care</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance caregiving capacity, family carers want information about their care receivers’ conditions to help them plan, and the ability to navigate existing resources, programs and supports.</p>
<p>Knowing “what comes next” is a central desire for many family carers, so that they can plan for an unpredictable future, manage expectations, and make informed decisions. Having this sense of control contributes to their overall well-being. One carer wished for</p>
<p><em>“…a crystal ball so I know what the future might look like, so I can prepare more for what might be required as we go forward.”</em></p>
<p>Family carers also feel lost, navigating fragmented health and social support services without a road map. They may not know what supports and programs are available or whether they qualify for any they do know about. Making sense of the flood of online information is overwhelming in the face of family carers’ time-consuming care responsibilities. Another carer described the situation as follows:</p>
<p><em>“It is like a library with the books in a pile on the floor and no card catalogue to even let me know where to start.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Targeted technology development can help carers achieve their goals</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11738 alignright" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Jacquie-and-Gigi-Dec04_51040-300x199.jpg" width="300" />
<p>When considering technology development to support carers, traditional problem‐focused approaches to technology design can limit discussions to performing caregiving tasks, failing to capture the relational and emotional aspects of caregiving. While technology is not the panacea that product developers and policy makers hope for, family carers did offer suggestions about how they are, or could be, using technology to enhance and preserve their caregiving capacity. Some carers use off-the-shelf technology to support their caregiving.</p>
<p><em>“My [Smart] watch tells me to breathe. It tells me to stand. Honestly. Sometimes it gets me up and I take a moment. I breathe.”</em></p>
<p>Other family carers thought of ways to modify existing technology to make it support their goals. They imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private internet-based chat rooms or interactive apps for information exchange.</li>
<li>A comprehensive, searchable repository of available supports that can yield individually tailored ‘system’ navigation.</li>
<li>Advanced search engines that use artificial intelligence to organize, evaluate, synthesize and summarize large amounts of information available from the internet.</li>
<li>Smart watches that monitor blood pressure or heart rate and proactively offer calming or stress reducing activities and techniques.</li>
<li>Interactive smart phone applications, like Siri, to help carers problem-solve and find solutions to in-the-moment issues like dealing with care receivers’ challenging behaviors.</li>
<li>Networking applications or online portals to connect family carers to mentors, counselors and each other.</li>
<li>Telephone information services to point family carers to services, supports and guidance along their care journeys.</li>
<li>Systems that connect carers, providing opportunities for socialization, recreation and reducing social isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, technology alone is not enough to sustain family care work. According to University of Birmingham social policy professor Paul Burstow, “<a href="https://www.healtheuropa.eu/benefits-technology-enabled-care/87408/">getting the balance right between ‘tech’ and ‘touch’ is vital</a>.” The insights gained from our work are an important first step in achieving this balance by understanding carers’ goals and figuring out how to support them in meaningful ways.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open science should be boosted in 2020 as the number of journals with research data policies increases as a result of collective action by publishers, who are </span></i><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/getting-started/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being encouraged</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopt a </span></i><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new common framework for journal data policies</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PLOS is the first publisher to align the policies of all its journals with this new framework</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable reproducible research we need transparent and accessible research outputs. And, as an enabler of reproducibility, transparency is what we – journals and publishers – can reasonably ask for, or even demand. Asking for transparency can begin not with new or sophisticated technology, but with a relatively low tech solution: policy.  Introducing a policy on research data sharing is a logical first step to raising awareness of an issue and beginning to create change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies have been in place for sharing some specific kinds of research data (such as protein structural data and genetic sequences) for a quarter of a century or more. Since 2014, PLOS has led the way with a </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory data availability policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all our articles, and since 2016 </span><a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.463/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most larger publishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis – have introduced tiered data policy initiatives. Coupled with discipline-specific policy initiatives, such as </span><a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Earth sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this means thousands of journals now have a data policy of some kind.</span></p>
<p><b>Making a statement about data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important tool, used by PLOS and others, for introducing a consistent data policy is a data availability statement in every published article. These statements indicate if, how and where the data supporting claims made in an article are available. Many journal and publisher research data policies still make data sharing and data availability statements optional rather than mandatory, but we welcome this steady progress on open research policies in the scholarly publishing community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since mandating data sharing and data availability statements in 2014, PLOS has published more than 127,000</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">articles with a data availability statement and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than</span></a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study has analysed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring a new section in every article published incurs costs, which at PLOS we see as a worthwhile investment in open research. It </span><a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/614"><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, training and resources for editors, authors, peer reviewers and editorial office staff, so mandating these statements is understandably a consideration for other publishers of thousands of articles per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is growing recognition </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1476871#.XjLptGj7S72"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from funders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, academic societies, editorial groups such as the ICMJE, that data availability statements are a practical, achievable and meaningful improvement to support transparency in research.</span></p>
<p><b>Wider adoption in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth rate of journal research data policies is likely to increase with the launch, in January 2020, of the STM Association’s </span><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STM research data year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has an objective to increase the number of journals with data policies and articles with data availability statements. Progress on policy implementation will be tracked across thousands of journals (STM is a publishing industry association with more than 120 organisational members). This feels like a turning point in open research policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STM Association is recommending the use of a</span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> common policy framework for journal research data policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote consistent approaches to journal research data policies, at its wide variety of members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy framework – </span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last week in a peer-reviewed journal after being </span><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Developing_a_research_data_policy_framework_for_all_journals_and_publishers/8223365/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is an output of an initiative, begun in 2016, </span><a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Research Data Alliance organisation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The framework includes 14 features, or common elements, of journal research data policies – including data citation, data repositories, and data peer review – and reusable policy text for journal editors and publishers to implement on their journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we compared PLOS’ data availability policy to this framework and, as a first step, updated some of the language, such as to give </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-data-management-plans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explicit support for sharing Data Management Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DMPs) – a document increasingly required in funding agency data policies. In doing so, PLOS continues to lead the way, by being the first publisher, to our knowledge, to align its entire journal portfolio with this new framework. As well increasing data sharing, another anticipated benefit of harmonising policy is reducing the burden on researchers and support staff with different or conflicting requirements between journals, and funders. The framework also provides future opportunities to review data policy language to ensure requirements are easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking forward to collaborating with publishers and researchers to continue driving up standards for transparency and openness in research in 2020.</span></p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>An estimated one quarter to one half of adolescents will at some point either be a victim of bullying, or engage in it — or both. Whether you’re on the receiving end, or dealing it out, there are all kinds of associated negative implications for mental health and well-being, including distress, depression and anxiety.  “This highlights an important need to understand the predictors of bullying and victimisation, in order to identify ways to reduce these experiences in adolescents,” write the researchers behind a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/14/10/1027/5611070">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em>. And this research has revealed one such factor: both bullies and victims show differences in the brain’s response to angry and fearful faces.</p>
<p><span id="more-39223"></span></p>
<p>Johnna Swartz at the University of California, Davis and her colleagues studied 49 adolescents, aged 12 to 15 years old, who were recruited from the local community. They first reported on their experiences of “relational bullying” (either as bully or victim) over the past 12 months. This is a form of non-physical bullying that involves damaging an individual’s social standing and relationships. It might entail excluding a child from social activities — like a party or a group chatting at a lunch table — or spreading gossip or rumours about them. Next, the participants were shown a series of images of faces chosen to signal fear, anger or happiness while their brains were scanned using fMRI.</p>
<p>The team found clear relationships between patterns of activity in the amygdala (a region of the brain involved in detecting threats) and scores on the relational bullying questionnaire.</p>
<p>A combination of above-average amygdala activity to angry faces and low activity to fearful faces was associated with engaging in more bullying behaviour. Meanwhile, greater amygdala responsiveness to angry faces and/or higher responsiveness to fearful faces was linked to more experiences of being a victim of this type of bullying. The scans also suggested that increased activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in response to fearful faces was associated with less bullying behaviour.</p>
<p>“These results suggest that relational bullying and victimization are related to different patterns of neural activity to angry and fearful faces, which might help in understanding how patterns of social information processing predict these experiences,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Exactly how those patterns may play out is not yet clear, but the researchers make some suggestions. When it comes to bullying behaviour, adolescents with a strong amygdala response to angry faces may be biased towards interpreting peers in ambiguous social situations as being hostile, they suggest. Low reactivity to fearful faces, meanwhile, may relate to a decreased ability to perceive or process someone else’s distress, which could lead to reduced empathy or perspective-taking. This combination might then make an individual more prone to bullying.</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, a</span>dolescents with stronger responses to either fearful or angry faces, or both, may be more likely to avoid their peers, leading to increased rejection and raising the chances of victimisation, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>What about the rACC findings? This region is involved in integrating social and emotional information. So perhaps, Swartz and her team speculate, heightened activity in response to fearful faces could reflect further processing of someone else’s distress, which may promote empathy, and reduce the likelihood of bullying.</p>
<p>The study does have several limitations. The sample size was relatively small. In fact, the results should be considered preliminary until they are replicated in a bigger sample, the researchers note. Also, as they didn’t measure levels of empathy, for example, the proposed explanations for the patterns in the data will need to be investigated in future studies. Then there’s the fact that this was a cross-sectional study. Perhaps differences in patterns of amygdala activity <em>resulted</em> from experiences of bullying or being bullied</p>
<p>More work is clearly needed to explore these questions. But given the scale of the problem, there’s an urgent need for such work. As the researchers themselves argue, “If these effects are replicated and extended to longitudinal research in the future, they will help to elucidate how biased patterns of social and emotional processing may increase risk for bullying and victimization in adolescents and could lead to more tailored intervention approaches.”</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper "Cliques of Neurons Bound into Cavities Provide a Missing Link between Structure and Function".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function
has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come
closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into
account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information
flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this
approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains
an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically
connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical
sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming
increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.</p>

This results in the formation of 3D cell-clusters which replicate many organ-of-origin characteristics. Current efforts to develop human organoid models will help us understand more about how our organs are formed and function and how to help in cases where diseases occur.</p>

The pancreas is located alongside the stomach and plays a critical role in our digestive system. Three main cell types are found in the pancreas; <strong>1) endocrine cells</strong> which reside in the islets of Langerhans and produce hormones including insulin that control sugar metabolism in our bodies, <strong>2) acinar cells</strong> which produce digestive enzymes and <strong>3) pancreatic ductal cells</strong> that form ducts (highlighted in figure 1) to collect the digestive enzymes and transport them to the small intestine to aid with the breakdown of food.</p>

<p>Malfunction of these cells is associated with a series of pancreatic diseases. Pancreatic cancer can affect any of these cell types and has the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30456-5/fulltext">lowest survival rate in the UK</a> among all cancer types.  Diabetes is the most common disease of the endocrine compartment and affects over <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html">4 million people in the UK</a>.  Other serious diseases, although perhaps less well known, include pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (which affects ductal cells) and pancreatic insufficiency (reduced acinar cell function). Severe cases of pancreatic disease often leave patients with the need for a pancreas or islet cell transplant deriving from deceased organ donors. However, the greatest hurdles to pancreas transplants include a limited number of organ donors and a need for life-time immunosuppression.</p>
<p>We aimed to produce a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of pancreas ductal cells, pancreatic diseases and the development of cell therapy for diabetes. Whilst developing the hPO model we were aware that for a cell therapy to translate into the clinic it must meet certain criteria which include cell expansion in a chemically defined manner that is compatible with Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) with strong evidence that the cells pose no risk of tumour formation.</p>
<p>To generate hPOs, we isolated ductal fragments from small samples of human pancreatic tissue and placed these in an ECM to act as a 3D scaffold. In order for this to be successful we had to develop a culture medium which would include all the signals and growth factors required to support the transition of pancreatic ducts into expandable pancreas organoids (Figure 2). Through a series of optimisations and iterations in which we tested activators and inhibitors of key cell signalling pathways we achieved a chemically defined culture medium that sustains the long-term culture of the pancreas cells. In addition, we developed a protocol to freeze the pancreatic tissue and recover healthy long-term expanding organoids from it. This gives us the ability to bank tissue, share samples and derive organoids at a later date.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11730" style="width: 664px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11730" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-2-300x172.jpg" width="654" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2: Human pancreatic ducts can be cultured in vitro and expanded as pancreatic organoids.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Importantly, genetic analysis showed that even after long-term expansion the hPOs did not show large genetic abnormalities. This is crucial, as accumulation of genetic defects during culturing, can alter cellular behaviours and impact on the results. We also found that upon transplant of these cells into mouse pancreas the hPO cells do not form tumours, indicating their genetic safety both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Finally, we aimed to develop a chemically defined ECM in which to culture hPOs as the commonly used ECMs (Matrigel and BME 2-RGF) are animal-derived and are unsuitable for cell therapies. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.cellendes.com/">Cellendes</a>, a company specialised in hydrogel technology, we could show for the first time the derivation and expansion of hPOs in a fully chemically defined hydrogel.</p>
<p>Our demonstration of the long-term expansion of human pancreas organoids in chemically defined conditions makes this an exciting system for many areas of research (Figure 3). This system can be used as a model of healthy ductal pancreas biology and the development of disease models of the ductal compartment, such as cystic fibrosis. Organoids can also be derived from diseased states and have already been used to model different types of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741401592X?via%3Dihub">pancreatic cancer</a> (PDAC and IPMN).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11731" style="width: 615px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11731" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-3-300x110.jpg" width="605" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3: Human pancreatic organoids have the potential to be used in many areas of research such as investigations into healthy tissue, diseased tissue and regenerative medicine.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Critically, our protocol does not rely on altering the genome or identity of the cells in order to achieve long-term expansion. This, combined with the lack of tumour formation when transplanted into mice, makes hPOs a safe approach for potential cell therapies. Cell therapies offer hope for patients without available curative treatment options. They provide the possibility of treating a disease by extracting cells from the patient or other donors, altering them in the lab to generate working cells and transplanting them into the patient. In theory, this would treat the disease while removing the need for immunosuppression as the cells would be either self-derived or very closely matched to the patient.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the culture system for human cells was funded by an EU programme (LSFM4LIFE) which aims at investigating the potential of hPOs as a clinical cell therapy. Whether hPOs could be the source for a cell therapy transplantation for diabetes remains to be investigated.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">What makes for an attractive female body? Whatever your views on this, across cultures, <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41548386_The_Attractive_Female_Body_Weight_and_Female_Body_Dissatisfaction_in_26_Countries_Across_10_World_Regions_Results_of_the_International_Body_Project_I"><span style="color: black;">and socioeconomic groups in particular</span></a></span><span class="None">, there are some differences in opinion. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Western media, with its promotion of “thin ideals”, has been cited as an influence on attitudes. But the only way to really explore this is to study groups of people who are very similar, except that some have been exposed to Western media, while others have not. Needless to say, this isn’t easy. However, a team led by Lynda Boothroyd at the University of Durham has now published just such a </span></span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-76797-001.pdf"><span style="color: black;">set of studies</span></a></span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US"> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. Their data suggests that TV exposure does indeed drive both men and women towards finding thinner female bodies more attractive.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-39216"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The team studied residents of seven villages in the remote South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua. At the time of the research, these people had no access to magazines and, generally, no access to the internet. Over the past decade, the government has, though, gradually extended the electricity grid through villages in the area, making TV-viewing possible. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">These people are mostly subsistence farmers and fishermen, with relatively poor food security. It has been suggested that people in such communities tend to find fleshier people more attractive — so if Western TV does have an influence, this would be a good spot to look for it. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For a first cross-sectional study, the researchers compared attitudes of people with regular TV access (Latin American soap operas, which feature thin, curvy actresses, and Hollywood movies were both popular genres) versus those who didn’t yet have it. A total of 314 men and women aged 15 to 79 gave basic details about themselves and rated the attractiveness of 50 colour photographs of women (with their faces blacked out) with Body Mass Indices that ranged from 11 to 42. (A healthy BMI is typically between 18.5 and 25.) </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Two factors emerged as being associated with a preference for thinner bodies. One was a higher level of education — and this, the researchers note, implies that someone has spent time studying in a large town, which could have given them earlier access to Western media. The other was TV exposure. Though different ethnic groups had slightly different opinions, when TV viewers vs non-TV viewers of the same ethnicity were compared, the difference in the “ideal” BMI could be at least 5 points. For one group, it was about 22 among the regular TV-watchers vs 27-28 among those who had not been exposed to TV, or who had very little access to it.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers also wanted to explore whether people who didn’t have access to TV and then gained it shifted towards preferring thinner bodies. For various reasons, this proved tricky. But for one village, it was possible to gather data on 31 individuals. The analysis did indeed suggest that with TV came a move towards finding a thinner female body most attractive. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For a final study, the researchers tried to mimic the immediate impact of TV exposure. They did this by showing villagers a series of photographs of either thin or plus-sized fashion models. After just 15 minutes of viewing these images, the participants changed their perceptions of the ideal female body size <i>in the direction of the images they had just seen</i>. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“These data strongly support the proposal that visual culture may be a critical contributory factor in the development of attraction in modern humans,” the researchers write.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">There could be other implications of the work, too. The data “strongly suggests visual media may be pushing preferences below the healthy optimum in nutritionally vulnerable populations such as ours,” the researchers write. The most favoured BMI in one of the TV-watching villages was 22.5, for instance: if a woman with that BMI lost a stone of weight during a bad fish season, she would shift to 19.3.

Using formal weight loss services can be effective in helping people who want to lose weight. In most parts of the UK, people who want to lose weight can be referred to an evidence-based group or a one-to-one weight loss program.</p>
<p>However, engagement of men in these weight loss programs is low. Men make up 11-25% of people who go to Counterweight, Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs. With a greater prevalence overweight men compared to women in the UK, and rising obesity rates globally, this lack of engagement is concerning.</p>
<p>Our study, published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, sought to understand what influences the engagement of men in weight loss services.</p>
<p><strong><u>Study findings</u></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Through interviews with 18 men with different experiences of weight loss programs (from not taking part to repeated engagers) we identified two key themes: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change</em></strong> and <strong><em>Attitudes towards existing weight loss services</em>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Theme 1: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change:</em></strong>  A medical diagnosis, coupled with instructions and a referral from a healthcare professional, triggered feelings of fear and worry, which motivated men to engage with weight loss programs. Awareness of severe alternative treatments, irreversible damage caused by obesity and impaired mobility were also key motivators:</p>
<p><em>“My weight had gone up to 160kg … and my GP hinted at, well you don’t want to carry on putting on weight because you might have to have a gastric band </em><em>and I said no, we’re not going to go there</em><em>” [Participant 2]</em></p>
<p>Seeing the effects of long-term weight problems on family members often boosted men’s personal motivation and helped them to understand how severe their situation was:</p>
<p><em>“I lost my sister-in-law … for her whole life she had a massive weight problem, and I put it down, you know, at the end it cost her life” [Participant 8]</em></p>
<p>Theme 2:<strong><em> Attitudes towards existing weight loss services:</em></strong>  Although these medical triggers and fears were powerful, men were still often reluctant to join in or stick with weight loss programs. Two sub-themes may explain why:</p>
<p>Subtheme 1: <em><strong>Female-dominated services:</strong></em>  Men often found themselves in the minority, provoking feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly due to the weight loss context:</p>
<p><em>“Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting” [Participant 4]</em></p>
<p>Some men felt that the female-dominated weight loss service threatened their identity and participating or worrying about weight was not perceived as a ‘manly’ thing to do; men also reported a lack of social support from discussing weight with peers:</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s just the stigma that’s attached to it for weight loss for men, they think it’s more of a woman’s thing to lose weight and worry about their weight” [Participant 7]</em></p>
<p>Subtheme 2: <em><strong>Incompatibility of existing services for men:</strong>  </em>Often, available services were not what the men wanted; programs that focused on discussing weight and praising weight loss were seen as intrusive and overbearing. This often led to men not taking part, only partially engaging or dropping out altogether.</p>
<p><em>“All clap each other and that, that doesn’t work for me, because that’s quite embarrassing for me. They have like a slimmer of the week and all that stuff, that doesn’t work for me” [P13, Repeater, Commercial]</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Implications for practice</u></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11727" height="195" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/exercise-300x195.jpg" width="300" />Men in the study discussed strong motivations to lose weight, triggered by fear resulting from a medical diagnosis or complication. The findings highlight the importance of healthcare professionals raising the issue of weight with patients. However, men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, so engaging men in alternative, non-medicalized settings, is also vital.</p>
<p>Findings that existing services are perceived to be female-dominated and misalign with men’s preferences emphasize the importance of providing a variety of service formats (e.g. men-only, mixed groups, one-to-one), which may be more compatible and satisfactory for men.</p>
<p>Understanding motivations and barriers to engaging is key to addressing them and reducing rising rates of obesity, overweight and associated weight-related health problems.</p>

The results of this quality assessment inform funding allocations for the next cycle and can impact university reputations.

<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four UK HE funding bodies believe that the outputs of publicly funded research should be freely accessible and widely available.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fully Open – beyond minimum compliance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tick all the boxes. PLOS articles are CC BY, embargo-free, fully machine readable, and automatically archived in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and other databases-so you can focus on your science and leave the publication details to us. As a fully OA publisher, PLOS also complies with the stricter OA requirements of funders like </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellcome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And with individualised </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can track the impact of your research in real time across HTML views, pdf downloads, citations, and even social media.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit your latest research in preprint form</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each element submitted to the REF is rated on a 5-point scale between 4 (world-leading) and 0 (below standard) on the basis of originality, significance and rigour. Researchers demonstrate their accomplishments by submitting their most creative, impactful and technically demanding works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another exciting development, the 2021 REF will consider publicly posted preprints, even if the final article publication date falls outside the 31st December, 2020 cutoff. When you submit to PLOS, you can choose to have your manuscript </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bioRxiv*, ensuring your work will qualify for the REF regardless of publication date.</span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Deadlines, though stressful, can be a pretty good motivator. Knowing you have to submit some work by a particular date can make it easier to get things done; you simply have to get on with it. This also goes for non-professional deadlines — trying to get in shape by the time you run a specific race, for example, can be a lot more motivating than a more vague and nebulous desire to get fit.</p>
<p>But why is this the case? Maayan Katzir and colleagues at Tel Aviv University have investigated the phenomenon in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027720300081?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a>, recently published in <em>Cognition —</em> and they suggest it may be down to how we conserve and use effort.<span id="more-39095"></span></p>
<p>In an initial experiment, 64 undergraduate students were asked to perform a complex task, completing a series of trials in which they had to switch between four different activities: two Stroop tasks, in which participants were asked to name colours or read words, and two spatial tasks, in which they had to indicate the direction of arrows. In each trial, they also had to ignore distracting stimuli. Participants were told that those scoring in the top 25% on accuracy would receive a monetary reward.</p>
<p>Participants completed 10 blocks of 240 trials, making a total of 2400 trials. Importantly, one group was told that the experiment was split into blocks, and were given information about how many blocks of the total they had completed as they went along, while the other was not. Neither group received feedback on how well they were performing. After the third, sixth and ninth blocks, participants were also asked how tired, bored and energetic they felt, the answers to which were used to calculate a fatigue score.</p>
<p><span>Participants in the feedback condition </span><em>—</em><span> those who were aware of how far they had progressed through the experiment </span><em>—</em><span> had a higher level of performance, as measured by their speed and accuracy; this was particularly pronounced towards the end of the experiment, suggesting that knowing when a task is going to end does indeed make it easier to complete. Participants receiving feedback also spent less time taking breaks towards the end than their non-feedback peers, though they didn’t report feeling any less fatigued.</span></p>
<p>A second experiment replicated the design of the first <em>—</em> except, this time, there were even more blocks. Participants were asked to complete twelve blocks of 240 trials, bringing the total to 2880. And as in the first experiment, feedback on progress had a positive impact on performance. Participants in the no feedback condition also reported feeling more fatigued <em>—</em> but only towards the end of the experiment. This group also spent more time on breaks than those aware of how many blocks they had left.</p>
<p>So why do we perform better when we know a task is going to end? Our desire to engage in more interesting activities may have something to do with it. If we’re aware of the fact a tedious task is nearly finished, we also know that leisure activities are within our reach: remaining engaged in our task and taking fewer breaks means that those more tantalising opportunities are closer to hand.</p>
<p>It may also be to do with how much effort we allocate to particular activities, the team suggests. If we have no idea how much longer we’re going to be engaging in a particular task, we’re unlikely to put all of our energy into it; if we know the end is near, we feel more able to try our hardest without fear of running out of energy.</p>
<p>This could relate to how we <em>conceptualise</em> willpower, too: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/19/why-some-people-find-it-harder-to-drag-themselves-to-bed-at-night/">another recent study</a> found that those who believe they possess a limited and finite amount of energy are less likely to motivate themselves to get to bed on time. So people who believe that our willpower is a limited resource may be particularly likely to try and conserve effort when they don’t know how much longer a task will last.</p>
<p>Those in the feedback condition did indeed perform better than their counterparts <em>—</em> but that doesn’t mean their performances were as high as they could be. It would be interesting to look at the timing of progress feedback <em>— </em>could introducing progress feedback only towards the end of a task push performance even higher?</p>
<p>What is clear, however, is that knowledge of how a task is progressing can have a significant impact both on how much effort you expend on it and how well you perform. So if you really want to get that boring bit of work out of the way? You may well benefit from setting yourself a deadline.</p>

Earlier this month, we broke the story of a misconduct inquiry against Mark Auslander, the director of the Michigan State University Museum in East Lansing. (That story was picked up by a number of news outlets in Michigan.) Auslander was found guilty by a university committee of having plagiarized, falsified data and committed other offenses … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/24/michigan-state-museum-director-vigorously-denies-virtually-all-of-university-panel-findings-against-him/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Michigan State museum director “vigorously” denies “virtually all” of university panel findings against him</span></a>

<p>Social Psychology looks at the nature and causes of individual behavior in social situations. It asks how others’ actions and behaviors shape our actions and behaviors, how our identities are shaped by the beliefs and assumptions of our communities. Fundamentally it looks for scientific answers to the most philosophical questions of self. These seven books about a range of issues within social psychology—identity, gender and sexuality, radicalism, social assumptions and biases—address just a few of the questions about who we are.</p><ol><li><strong><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-strange-case-of-donald-j-trump-9780197507445">Strange Case of Donald J.

An “engram” is the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Futuristic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception" target="_blank"><i>Inception</i></a>-like” experiments in mice have shown that conditioned fear memories (tone-shock or context-shock associations) can be deleted or “inserted” by manipulating a functionally-defined class of neurons known as engram cells.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="441" data-original-width="441" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span><b>A pink engram cell alongside a white nonengram cell</b> (modified from <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full" target="_blank">Josselyn &amp; Tonegawa, 2020</a>). Within the hippocampus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus%20title=" target="_blank">dentate gyrus</a> cells were filled with a tracer to examine cellular anatomy (white). Engram cells active during fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink (because of overlap with the white tracer).</span><br /><br /><br />A primary truism of neuroscience is that memory storage is mediated by structural and synaptic plasticity. If engram cells are dedicated to preserving specific memories, the next question is: how do you define “a memory”? Most rodent studies search for engram cells associated with memories like “this location = bad”. But what about engrams formed after learning a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00654/full" target="_blank">list of words</a>? Memories of <i>Tomato</i>, <i>Attic</i>, <i>Pliers</i>, <i>Motorcycle</i>, etc. are presumably represented by overlapping/distinctive groups of engrams distributed across multiple brain regions. What about complex autobiographical memories, like what you did on your 21st birthday? The full day (and night) of festivities consisted of many different events tied together by their temporal proximity and autobiographical significance. Studies of event perception and segmentation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-051101" target="_blank">Zacks, 2020</a>) are informative in this regard: <br /><blockquote>What is the relationship between event structure in perception and that in memory? There is strong evidence that the segments that are identified during event perception correspond to the representational units in subsequent memory. First, the boundaries themselves are remembered exceptionally well. ... Second, event boundaries tended to occur at points in time when many features were changing, and the participants remembered those points better. </blockquote><br /><b>Life Beyond Engrams</b><br /><br />The development of an appropriate animal model to allow selective manipulation of the whole-brain engram associated with one “birthday event” (but not the others) seems remote. Likewise, the often-involuntary nature of autobiographical memory retrieval (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721410370301" target="_blank">Bernsten, 2010</a>) <span class="st">— in my case, the spontaneous appearance of visual images associated with loss and grief </span><span class="st"><span class="st">— is not illuminated by current engram research.

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">Transitioning away from Matlab</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">In my last article</a>, I talked about how I got a job in industry. I had been programming Python on and off for 10 years when I got my first non-academic job. Having proficiency in a language that people use outside of academia will improve your chances of getting a job in industry. Learning a new language will also grow your abilities as a programmer and will unlock new projects and analyses you might have otherwise been afraid to tackle.</p>



<p>What if you’re in a lab that’s been using Matlab for years and you haven’t had a chance to learn Python? Here’s my guide to transition off of Matlab to Python. There are a few specific links to neuroscience at the end of the article, but it should be useful to anybody approaching Python from a Matlab background.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This is part 1 of an ongoing series on learning Python. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Part 2 – orienting yourself in Python is here</a>.</p></blockquote>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>Learn Python the hard way</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most popular languages out there – <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">more popular than Matlab by a factor of at least 10</a> – and it’s the language the vast majority people transitioning from Matlab will choose. There’s two basic strategies you can apply here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer learning (aka the easy way). You have things in Matlab you use every day – array operations, plotting, signal processing, etc. You learn to do the same thing in Python, <a href="https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/">perhaps with the aid of a cheatsheet</a>. A lot of the Python data science API (numpy, scipy and matplotlib in particular) are very  similar to Matlab. They were originally built to replicate functionality in Matlab. With this route, you’ll get moderately productive very fast.</li>
<li>Starting from scratch (aka the hard way). Learn the syntax, then do something you couldn’t do in Matlab, for example:
<ul>
<li>Learn algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Make a GUI application (e.g. in PyQT)</li>
<li>Make a game</li>
<li>Make a dynamic website</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My <em>slightly</em> controversial opinion is you’re better off starting from scratch. If you use the transfer learning method you will be less productive than you currently are for a long time. You will feel annoyed at your own incompetence (<em>"why am I doing this to myself? I could do the same thing twice as fast!"</em>). Furthermore, you will have a tendency of doing things <em>the Matlab way</em> (using matrices for everything, index chaining, avoiding for loops) that are error-prone and you shouldn’t be doing in a general purpose programming language.</p>
<p>By starting from scratch you will learn new things you couldn’t do before at all – you will feel like you have new powers. You can write a GUI! You can make dynamic visualizations! You can make games! You can do deep learning! Your day-to-day productivity won’t suffer because you’ll be learning <em>new</em> skills instead of relearning old ones poorly. You’ll end up being more productive in Python than you ever were in Matlab. You’ll write idiomatic code.</p>
<h3>How long will it take to learn Python?</h3>
<p><a href="https://qr.ae/T3Q1WK">500 hours</a>. Ok, that number is made up, but it’s probably not far from the truth. You can learn the syntax in a weekend. You can make your first significant project in a few days. <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">However, proficiency comes with time</a>. Don’t wait until 3 weeks before a technical interview to start learning. I’ve seen candidates do this, it’s not good. You’re better off asking for an interview in Matlab if you don’t have hundreds of hours of Python under your belt. Start today, keep at it every day (1-2 hours a day will suffice) and it will pay off.</p>
<h3>Why is Python so popular anyway?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio">Yoshua Bengio</a>. Again, I’m halfway joking, but one of the biggest reasons people have moved away from Matlab was the adoption of Python for deep learning. It started with Theano, which came out of Bengio’s lab. It built on numpy, scipy, sklearn and jupyter, all of which predated the rise of deep learning. Then came Tensorflow. People at Google were already using Python; Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, was famously employed by Google at one point. Google needed a high-level language to iterate quickly on models; many of the people involved in Theano were involved in Tensorflow. Python made sense.</p>
<p>It could have landed another way. <a href="http://torch.ch/">We might all be using Lua instead if Yann had prevailed over Yoshua</a>! But combine industry pressure, lots of money, the education sector needing a good first language, and open source, and Python is a runaway success now. And it might change in the future. Maybe we’ll all be using Swift in the future. Or Rust. Or Julia (my personal favorite!). For now, Python is the language to learn.</p>
<h3>I don’t even hate Matlab</h3>
<p>I’ve used Matlab extensively. I’ve been deep enough to create my own mex files and using Java. I’ve created GUIs in GUIDE. I have created pretty big codebases and classes. I even coded up my own neural net framework which I never published.</p>
<p>I’m not going to bash Matlab here. You can write good code in Matlab – and many people that have been using Matlab for years end up writing disciplined code. However, I have seen a lot of Matlab code of a certain kind – using matrices for everything (even though Matlab has dataframes and hashmaps!), avoiding for loops (even though it has a great JIT!), using a giant set of globals in GUIDE (there’s a way of writing good GUIDE apps, I’m sure!). It will take a little bit of work to unlearn these old habits if you have them.</p>
<h3>A curriculum</h3>
<p>If you have never seen or touched Python, you can start by learning the syntax and the basic data structures (tuples, dicts, and lists) through online resources.</p>
<p>Some sample websites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">Learn Python</a>. Skip the numpy and pandas tutorials, we’ll get back to that later.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codecademy</a>. Similar.</li>
<li><a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>. A lot of practical exercises in this one. 30$.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.makeartwithpython.com/">Make Art With Python</a>. If you’re interested in games and interactive art this might hold your attention. 30$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these websites will have some sort of live evaluation directly on the website. Pretty soon you’ll need a local install of Python. I recommend installing the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda distribution of Python 3</a>. This includes the <code>conda</code> environment manager, which will allow you to maintain different sets of packages.</p>
<h3>Picking a first project</h3>
<p>At this point, you could consider using Python for a project (no data science stuff yet). The first app I made was a GUI to upload files to a website. A few years later I made an app in PyQT to annotate physiological recordings with notes. You could make a website. Lots of different projects but basically make sure you cover the basics, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions – these will trip you up. Python has pass-by-reference semantics for object types. In Matlab, a function cannot modify its arguments (unless it’s a reference object, but these are pretty uncommon). But in Python you can mess with your arguments:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_append_fun(a)
    a.append('b')

c = ['a']
my_append_fun(c)
print(c)
# Prints ['a', 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>It’s not good practice to do this, but you might do it accidentally and you will be very confused.</p>
<ul>
<li>modules – in Matlab, one file = one function (unless it’s an internal function private to that file). In Python you can have multiple functions and classes inside a file. Each file defines a module that can be imported. Then there are other people’s modules! pip! Understanding how and when a certain module or function is accessible is one of the subtle things about Python.</li>
<li>tuples, dicts and lists. A simple write-only type for fixed-length groups; a super-powerful hashmap type; and a variable-length vector. It will take you a while to understand the trade-offs for each of these types. Your assumptions will be wrong! You might think appending to a list in a for loop is super slow because appending to a vector is super slow in Matlab. Wrong! It’s actually super fast.</li>
<li>classes. Classes are behaviour + data. Maybe you’ve been doing OOP in Matlab. If not, it’s time to pick it up!</li>
<li>strings and file IO. Format strings, <code>with</code> statements, StringIO, regex – all workaday things in a general purpose programming language that you might never have touched in Matlab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data structures and algorithms</h3>
<p>Consider learning about data structures and algorithms. Many professional programmers are self-taught and never really learn about these fundamentals. They learn intuitively what is slow and fast, and can code many non-trivial algorithms. They might even use complexity analysis (O notation).</p>
<p>Once you learn data structures, your world will open up. This is especially true for people with a Matlab background because the language tends to force you to use the same structure over and over again (the matrix). You might not know what to do with tuples, dicts, lists and objects. You need some solid foundations to transition out of the weird programming model Matlab imposes.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms and data structures classes on Coursera by Tim Roughgarden</a>. These are the same classes you’d get in CS at Stanford, and they are very good. Really tough. You will feel like your mind is melting – in a good way.</p>
<p>You might try a daily challenge, like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a>. There’s <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> if you’re more math-inclined.</p>
<h3>The data science ecosystem</h3>
<p>It’s finally time learn the data science pipeline. Because you will have learned basic Python well, and the tools are very similar to Matlab, your transition will be very smooth. Here’s one tutorial that guides you through the <a href="https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/">Python data science ecosystem</a>. This means getting familiarized with:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
<li>jupyter for dynamic notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest package to learn for many people coming from a Matlab background is <code>pandas</code>. Why would anyone want to use pandas? <em>Can’t I just use a matrix?</em></p>
<p>How many times has your PhD advisor told you to label your axes in your plots? A thousand times? Labeling axes is important to understand what the data means. When you index into an unlabelled matrix, say <code>df(:, 7)</code>, you’re giving yourself the possibility of forgetting what the data means. Wouldn’t it be better to use <code>df.reaction_time_ms</code>? Yes!</p>
<p>You might even have learned how to do reductions, querying and aggregations on raw matrix. This code might give you the mean reaction time for participant 10:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">mean(df(df(:, 1)==10, 7))
</code></pre>
<p>That’s bad! What if you add a column in your CSV? Then column 7 becomes column 8, your stats are wrong and you’ll lose months tracking down the issue. This code is super error-prone and makes kittens cry. I’m not saying it’s impossible to do this the right way in Matlab – I’m just saying that’s often how people do it. Compare the pandas way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df.query('participant_id == 10').reaction_time_ms.mean()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html">Take the time to read the pandas tutorial in full</a>. You might want to pick up a book as well after a little while, for instance <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/">Python for Data Science</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, you’ll need to practice your new skills. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Join a Kaggle competition</a>, or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">follow a data science MOOC</a>.</p>
<h3>Specialized tools for neuroscience</h3>
<p>At this point you might be productive enough to use Python on a daily basis. Congratulations! It’s a good time to learn about Python neuroscience tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nilearn.github.io/">nilearn</a> for machine learning with MRI</li>
<li><a href="https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">brian</a> for spiking neural net simulations</li>
<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a> or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</a> for fitting ANNs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut">deeplabcut</a> to track animals without markers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.psychopy.org/">Psychopy</a> for visual stimulus presentation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo">neo</a> for managing electrophysiology data in Python</li>
<li><a href="https://mne.tools/dev/auto_tutorials/intro/plot_10_overview.html">MNE</a> for EEG analysis</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> for Bayesian inference</li>
</ul>
<p>Know of another indispensable tool? Write it in the comments.</p>
<h3>Transition existing pipelines to Matlab</h3>
<p>It will be hard to transition pipelines developed over years wholesale out of Matlab and into Python. You’ll want to freeze data obtained after running a pipeline into a file format that you can transport from Matlab to Python. <a href="https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Reading_mat_files.html">Matlab’s .mat file format is readable in Python</a>. Since v7.3 .mat files are in the hdf5 file format, for which Python has excellent support.</p>
<p>In the future, you might find that you need Matlab for very little, and only one or two recalcitrant pipelines will need to be maintained. <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">You could wrap these pipelines in a docker image</a>, so they keep working for years to come, despite changes in OS and Matlab versions.</p>
<h3>Becoming proficient</h3>
<p>You might start developing significant codebases. Will you be putting everything in Dropbox? No, you’ll be using <code>git</code>! You’ll need to know the command line. <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html">Follow the software carpentry class</a> and learn about the Unix terminal and source control.</p>
<p>To really step up your game, contribute to an open-source project. If you’re unsure where to start, <a href="https://www.brainhack.org/">join a Brainhack event</a> – people will ask for volunteers for their projects and they’ll guide you through the process of making a submission. Friendships will be created! Collaborations hatched! Bagels will be had!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll feel the need for speed at this point. Tear through billion row datasets with <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">Spark</a> or <a href="https://dask.org/">dask</a>. JIT your for loops or compile them down to C with <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>, <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a>. <a href="https://rlouf.github.io/post/jax-random-walk-metropolis/">Monte Carlo simulations with a thousand parallel chains</a>? Not a problem!</p>
<h3>Make it social</h3>
<p>People don’t realize how social programming is. As a software engineer at Google, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned about the core tooling in seminars with other engineers</li>
<li>Had people review my code</li>
<li>Reviewed other people’s code</li>
<li>Pair programmed</li>
<li>Shared analyses with other people who critiqued the analysis (both the content and the method)</li>
<li>Went to retreats to learn new tools</li>
<li>Organized a reading group</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned more from these experiences than from much of the book reading and solitary programming I’ve done. You don’t have to make your learning journey an isolating one. When you do Kaggle, join a team. Go to local meetups – in Montreal for instance, there’s <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pitonneux/">Les Pitonneux</a>, who meet up almost daily. Many groups focus on supporting underrepresented groups in computer science, for example <a href="https://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>.</p>
<p>There are hackerspaces where you might find people in the same situation. You can go to tutorial sessions at conferences. Make friends and create a social support system to help you on your journey.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve had to relearn programming many times over the years. Toolbook, QBasic, VB, Delphi, Actionscript, Perl, PHP – I’ve written significant chunks of code in each of these languages. They’re all either dead or on their way out. Having seen the trajectory of these languages, it feels to me like Matlab is on its way out as well. This doesn’t mean it won’t be used at all – after all, PHP is 10 times less popular today than at its peak, but it still runs Facebook! But it does mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be more people who know Matlab than people who are hiring people who know Matlab. It won’t do you any favors on your CV.</li>
<li>Professionals software engineers have already switched away from Matlab. You will have a lot of trouble hiring professional programmers to create Matlab-based infrastructure in your future lab if you choose to stay in academia.</li>
<li>The Mathworks is a single-source vendor, and their software is closed-source. What happens if they run out of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to move away from Matlab. Take the first step today!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-iii-faut-il-evaluer-la-recherche/">Une analyse globale de la nouvelle politique de recherche (III) - Faut-il évaluer la recherche ?</a></h4>

<p>Dans les billets précédents (<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">1</a> et <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/">2</a>), j’ai exposé le contexte idéologique des réformes structurelles de la recherche qui sont en cours. J’ai tenté de montrer qu’il s’agit de théories bureaucratiques dont l’argumentation est essentiellement obscurantiste, c’est-à-dire que non seulement une série de poncifs (il vaut mieux financer les excellents que les mauvais) et d’analogies douteuses (les vertus supposées du « darwinisme ») tiennent lieu d’argumentation, mais en outre les éléments empiriques contradictoires sont tout simplement ignorés.</p>
<p>Face à ce type de critique, une réaction courante est : mais alors, vous refusez d’être évalués ? On convoque alors l’image du savant dans sa tour d’ivoire, ou pire, celle du fonctionnaire fainéant. En effet, un point central des réformes managériales en cours est la notion d’évaluation : il faudrait développer une « culture de l’évaluation », avec des « indicateurs de performance ». Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? Pour répondre à cette question, encore faut-il préciser ce que l’on entend par « évaluer » et quels sont précisément les sujets et objets de ce verbe (qui évalue, et qu’est-ce qui est évalué).</p>
<p>Pour cela, il me semble utile de faire une petite digression philosophique pour comprendre la nature de l’activité scientifique qu’il s’agit d’évaluer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Digression philosophique</em></p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que la science ? Vaste question philosophique qui a été abordée par de nombreux angles et que je me propose de résumer en quelques paragraphes. Je me contenterai pour le sujet de ce billet d’une description assez grossière : la science, en tant qu’activité sociale, est la poursuite de la vérité. Description néanmoins un peu plus subtile qu’elle en a l’air : il s’agit bien de tendre vers un idéal de vérité sur le monde, mais c’est un idéal, c’est-à-dire quelque chose que l’on poursuit sans jamais vraiment atteindre.</p>
<p>Comment la science est-elle produite ? Une position philosophique historiquement importante, qui date du 19<sup>e</sup> siècle et début du 20<sup>e</sup>, est le positivisme : la science consiste à observer des faits élémentaires, puis à en déduire logiquement des lois de la nature. Il y a donc une méthode que l’on peut suivre pour produire des vérités scientifiques avec certitude. C’est en quelque sorte un modèle industriel de la science, et ce n’est sans doute pas un hasard si cette position est apparue au 19<sup>e</sup> siècle. De ce point de vue découle la conception naïve de la revue par les pairs comme certification des connaissances produites ou des méthodes employées. Point crucial, selon ce modèle de la science, il est trivial de distinguer la bonne science de la mauvaise science : la bonne science est tout simplement celle qui suit correctement la méthode scientifique (d’où le rôle présumé des journaux comme « gate-keepers » ; voir mon <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/revues-predatrices-quel-est-le-probleme/">texte sur ce sujet</a>). Dans ce modèle, on peut donc appliquer des méthodes industrielles de gestion, de « management » dirait-on aujourd’hui, parce qu’il existe des mesures objectives (externes) de qualité. Là est la justification de l’usage de la bibliométrie comme outil d’évaluation.</p>
<p>Or, si cette position reste populaire, en particulier chez les non chercheurs (mais pas seulement), elle a été essentiellement démolie par les travaux en philosophie et histoire des sciences au cours du siècle dernier. Le plus connu est sans doute Karl Popper, qui sous un angle logique a établi que l’on ne peut pas établir en science des vérités mais uniquement des faussetés - simplement parce qu’une proposition s’applique à une infinité de cas que l’on ne peut tous vérifier. Il s’agit alors de tester des théories, et non de déduire des vérités scientifiques. D’autres travaux, moins connus des scientifiques mais néanmoins très importants, ont montré que la difficulté est plus profonde que cela. Quine a montré que la notion même de fait élémentaire est une erreur conceptuelle. C’est une forme de réductionnisme de la connaissance (je reformule), l’idée que la connaissance est un ensemble de faits et lois indépendants les uns des autres. Or c’est impossible, car pour énoncer un fait il faut utiliser des concepts, c’est-à-dire des théories. Par conséquent, il n’y a pas de fait élémentaire mais plutôt un système (plus ou moins) cohérent de connaissances. Kuhn a montré historiquement que co-existent généralement des théories scientifiques contradictoires portant sur les mêmes observations, ou encore que différentes théories (ou écoles de pensée) considèrent comme pertinents des corpus d’observations différents. Lakatos (élève de Popper) a montré qu’une théorie scientifique est non seulement une théorie qui en principe doit être falsifiable, mais également qui en pratique est falsifiée, et que cette caractéristique n’est pas forcément dysfonctionnelle. C’est-à-dire qu’il arrive couramment que des observations inattendues semblent contredire la théorie dominante, mais pour autant la théorie n’est pas forcément remise en cause. A la place, l’observation est interprétée en postulant une hypothèse auxiliaire. C’est le cas presque systématiquement aujourd’hui dans de nombreuses branches de la physique parce que l’on considère les théories physiques bien établies. Par exemple : la trajectoire de telle planète dévie des prédictions des lois de Newton (ou Einstein), conclusion : il doit y avoir un satellite autour de cette planète (et non : les lois de Newton sont fausses).</p>
<p>Je pourrais citer de nombreuses autres contributions importantes. Pour le sujet qui nous occupe, le point important est qu’il n’existe pas de méthode scientifique que l’on pourrait appliquer pour produire des vérités scientifiques. Cela ne veut pas dire que la science est arbitraire, au contraire. Cela veut dire que la réflexion sur la méthodologie et plus globalement l’épistémologie font elles-mêmes partie intégrale de l’activité scientifique : il n’y a pas de norme objective externe à la communauté scientifique. Cela signifie que la science progresse non par la production et la certification des savoirs, mais par le débat scientifique. Ce point est crucial, car il fonde la justification fondamentale de la nécessaire autonomie scientifique. Il ne peut y avoir d’évaluation de la production scientifique selon des normes externes (notamment bibliométriques), tout simplement parce que ces normes n’existent pas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Evaluer la recherche</em></p>
<p>Revenons donc à notre question : faut-il évaluer la recherche ?</p>
<p>Premièrement, commençons par la motivation de cette question. La motivation, c’est que l’argent public doit être bien utilisé, c’est-à-dire dans l’intérêt de la société. Cela implique sans doute que les politiques publiques doivent être évaluées, c’est-à-dire que lorsque l’on modifie la structure du système de recherche par des réformes, l’impact global de ces réformes devrait être analysé. Or c’est précisément le type d’évaluation utile qui n’est pas effectué, ou qui est ignoré. Les réformes engagées depuis 15 ans, introduisant des nouveaux modes d’organisation (financement par projets par exemple) n’ont manifestement pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il serait donc logique de revenir sur ces réformes et de les modifier. Or ce n’est pas le cas : au contraire, il s’agirait d’amplifier ces réformes.</p>
<p>Ce qui doit être évalué donc, c’est l’efficacité globale du système de recherche, en relation avec son organisation. Si le système global doit être évalué, est-ce qu’il en découle que les agents individuels de ce système doivent être évalués ? Il y a ici un glissement qui est tout à fait fallacieux. Bien sûr, si l’on veut connaître, disons, la production scientifique totale du pays, on va additionner la production scientifique de chacun des chercheurs. Du point de vue individuel, cette « évaluation » est donc faite dans un but de mesure uniquement ; c’est seulement au niveau du système global que cette mesure sert à influencer l’action publique. Mais quand on dit qu’il faut évaluer les chercheurs, ce dont on parle c’est une évaluation qui a une conséquence individuelle et qui est donc utilisée comme outil de gestion. Par exemple, on donne une prime aux chercheurs qui publient plus, de façon à les inciter à augmenter leur productivité. Il ne s’agit donc ici pas simplement d’évaluer les politiques publiques, ce qui semble assez consensuel, mais d’instaurer un mode de gestion bien particulier, à savoir une gestion bureaucratique managériale, reposant sur des indicateurs individuels objectifs.</p>
<p>Or comme je l’ai expliqué plus haut, il n’existe pas d’indicateurs objectifs de la qualité scientifique à un niveau individuel. On peut dire d’un pays qu’il produit plus ou moins d’articles scientifiques, ou mesurer différents indicateurs macroscopiques. Mais aucune bureaucratie ne peut dire ce qui est « vrai » ou « important » en termes de vérité scientifique, puisque c’est justement là le cœur de l’activité des chercheurs. Une conséquence immédiate de cet état de fait est qu’instaurer une gestion par objectifs est nécessairement contre-productif, puisque les agents vont alors être incités à optimiser des choses qui ne sont pas alignées avec la qualité scientifique, chose non mesurable. C’est d’ailleurs un phénomène tellement bien connu qu’il a un nom, la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_de_Goodhart">loi de Goodhart</a>. Par exemple, demander aux chercheurs de produire davantage d’articles a pour résultat que les chercheurs produisent davantage d’articles. Par exemple en saucissonnant les articles, en faisant des articles bâclés, etc. Cela fonctionne pour toute métrique qu’un bureaucrate pourra inventer.</p>
<p>Mais alors, il ne faut pas évaluer ? Premièrement, l’évaluation, comme je l’ai expliqué, est un aspect central et quotidien de l’activité du chercheur, si l’on entend cela comme la discussion critique des productions scientifiques. C’est le métier du chercheur que d’évaluer ses pairs - le mot « évaluer » est sans doute mauvais, du fait qu’il ne s’agit bien sûr pas de mettre cinq étoiles à la loi de la relativité. Simplement, cette évaluation n’est pas un mode de gestion, mais de débat, et ce débat ne peut se faire qu’entre pairs, pas avec une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, l’évaluation des personnes (et non plus des énoncés scientifiques) est naturellement inévitable à au moins un moment de la carrière : le recrutement (et, sans doute, la promotion). Mais encore une fois, cette évaluation ne peut être faite de manière bureaucratique selon des métriques objectives pour les raisons déjà énoncées. Elle ne peut se faire que par des pairs, de manière subjective donc. De quel genre d’évaluation parle-t-on ici ? Le discours managérial parle de « culture du résultat » : il s’agirait d’évaluer la production des individus ; à charge des individus que faire en sorte que cette production soit bonne – d’où une forme de « sélection darwinienne ». D’où un certain nombre d’indicateurs (nombre de publications, prestige des journaux dans lesquels elles apparaissent, etc). Mais d’une part on retombe encore une fois dans l’erreur positiviste (il n’y a pas, surtout sur des résultats récents, de mesure consensuelle de l’« importance » de résultats scientifiques) et d’autre part on commet ce qu’on appelle en psychologie un <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution">biais de substitution</a>, c’est-à-dire que le facteur que l’on cherche à évaluer est complexe et par conséquent on en utilise un autre plus simple (voir une <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/hiring-committees/">série de textes</a> que j’ai écrits il y a quelques années sur les biais cognitifs dans les recrutements académiques). Que cherche-t-on à évaluer lors d’un recrutement de chercheur permanent ? Il s’agit d’estimer si, au cours de sa carrière <em>future</em>, le chercheur produira des connaissances nouvelles et intéressantes. Bien sûr on ne connait pas sa carrière future, on doit donc la deviner. Et qu’est-ce qui détermine la qualité de la production scientifique d’un individu ? Un certain nombre de facteurs, dont certains sont propres à la personne, comme ses compétences et ses qualités (rigueur intellectuelle et intégrité par exemple), et d’autres sont contextuels (collaborateurs, conditions de travail, et bien sûr hasard puisqu’on parle de recherche, donc de choses non connues à l’avance). Ce que l’on doit donc déterminer, dans le contexte d’un recrutement, ce sont les facteurs propres, c’est-à-dire les compétences et qualités scientifiques de l’individu. La production passée est bien sûr corrélée à ces facteurs, mais ce n’est pas ce que l’on cherche à déterminer. Enfin il y a un risque bien connu à substituer un facteur indirect au facteur causal que l’on cherche à évaluer. En plus de l’erreur dans la sélection elle-même, cette substitution induit des changements de comportement des individus visant à optimiser ce facteur non causal, ce qui finit par rendre la sélection arbitraire (loi de Goodhart). Par exemple, un étudiant ira dans un laboratoire connu non parce qu’il pense y apprendre quelque chose, mais parce qu’il a plus de chances d’être co-auteur d’un article dans un journal prestigieux.</p>
<p>L’évaluation, donc, doit être une évaluation des compétences et non des résultats. Naturellement, les compétences ne peuvent être correctement évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents, et non par une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? D’abord, il faut principalement évaluer les politiques publiques de recherche. Celles qui sont instituées depuis 15 ans sont manifestement mauvaises et il faut donc les repenser et non les amplifier. Voilà l’évidence. Ensuite, oui bien sûr, il est nécessaire d’évaluer les chercheurs, au moment du recrutement ou de la promotion, et non comme mode de gestion quotidien. Et ce sont les compétences qui doivent être évaluées et non les « résultats ». Ces compétences, enfin, ne peuvent être évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents et non par des bureaucrates. Voilà en quel sens on peut dire qu’il faut « évaluer la recherche ».</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Language learning can be a matter of much concern for new parents, who often worry about what their baby is saying, how they’re saying it, and when. With <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/news/anne-fernald-how-children-learn-language">previous research</a> suggesting that frequent verbal engagement with babies can boost vocabulary and reading comprehension, this preoccupation is not without merit. But even those parents who aren’t too fixated on baby’s first word may in fact be improving their offspring’s language, even if they’re not aware of it.</p>
<p>A form of speech dubbed “parentese” may be a key factor in improving language learning in infants, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/28/1921653117">a new study in <em>PNAS</em></a> has suggested. Naja Ferjan Ramírez and colleagues from the University of Washington examined the distinctive form of sing-song speech often aimed at babies, finding that it improved conversation between parents and their children and even boosted language development.</p>
<p><span id="more-39192"></span></p>
<p>It’s important to note that parentese is not the same as baby talk: it’s less “googoo gaga” and more an exaggerated form of normal speech. So rather than the nonsense noises that usually characterise baby talk, parentese is defined by the higher pitch, slower tempo and exaggerated intonation of the speaker, a tone many of us have adopted around children without even realising it.</p>
<p>The researchers assigned 71 families with typically-developing six month old babies to one of two conditions. In the coaching condition, parents were given feedback on their use of language, speaking style, volume of speech and parent-child turn-taking by a linguistic coach. These families were explicitly told about parentese and how to use it to engage children, and were played audio samples from recordings of their own interactions with their children to highlight particularly good uses of parentese and turn-taking. Language milestones were also discussed: when to expect infants to say their first word or use word combinations, for example.</p>
<p>The coach also gave the families “<a href="https://www.vroom.org/">Vroom cards”</a>, which give information about how to promote language during normal social interactions, and age-appropriate books. Families in the other condition received no coaching.</p>
<p>Families provided recordings of themselves talking to and with their children at six, ten, fourteen and eighteen months of age, and at the eighteen month mark filled in a survey designed to assess language and communication development.</p>
<p>As expected, the coaching made a big difference. Parents who had been given extra guidance both significantly increased their use of parentese and their level of conversational turn-taking compared to those who had not. Their children also saw the benefit, showing a greater increase in vocalisations between six and eighteen months than the control group. They also had larger vocabularies overall at eighteen months than kids in the control group, suggesting that positive changes in the way parents communicate with their children are not temporary but durable and long-lasting.</p>
<p>So why is parentese such a successful mode of communication? A dramatic change in pitch may have something to do with it, as may the exaggerated facial expressions that often accompanies such speech. These “make the speaker sound happy”, the team says, holding infants’ attention and allowing them to take in more words and meanings than if they were distracted.</p>
<p>Understanding the benefit of taking turns in conversation was also a large part of the coaching condition, and this social element may be a thus-far neglected explanation for the success of parentese. Social context is a crucial part of language learning — and if parentese increases social interaction, it follows that language learning may also improve.</p>
<p>The results also have some pleasing practical ramifications. Parentese was used by all of the families in the study — it was a basic feature of child-parent communication, which will come as no surprise to anybody who’s spent much time with small children.</p>
<p>But the majority of the parents involved in the study had no idea what exactly parentese did for their infants’ language development, and were not aware of when they were using it or in what contexts. Being aware of parentese and its multiple positive qualities may be very useful indeed for families who are hoping to improve their children’s language development.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>
<p>Most of us are not surprised to hear that a child’s chances of achieving success, physical health, and mental well-being depend heavily on the socioeconomic status of the family into which they are born. <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43943/9789241563703_eng.pdf;jsessionid=CD6C7826FEF557B4AD7ED1E929712790?sequence=1">A large-scale global study commissioned by the World Health Organisation</a> found that the lower the income of a family, the more likely their child is to suffer physical and mental health issues later in life, run into problems with the legal system, and die early.</p>
<p>But a physical lack of resources may not be the only factor driving poor outcomes. Last month, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/01/1820845116">a study published in <em>PNAS</em></a> revealed that children’s perceptions of their family’s socioeconomic standing might matter more than how well their families are <em>actually</em> doing — at least when it comes to their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-39186"></span></p>
<p>Evidence that perceptions might matter more than reality has been around for years. Individuals who perceive themselves as having lower socioeconomic status tend to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600368?dopt=Abstract">report</a> having more mental and physical health problems than those who rank themselves as having higher status, even when controlling for common indicators of status such as household income and occupation. The existence of this so-called “status syndrome” raises the possibility that government-run programmes aimed at changing young people’s attitudes towards their status might somewhat offset the negative health outcomes of income inequality.</p>
<p>However, the alleged “status syndrome” presents a dilemma. What if an individual’s perceived status is actually just a more accurate reflection of their true socioeconomic status than the “objective” measures such as income that researchers frequently use? That is, perhaps individual’s perceptions tap into a host of other factors that determine opportunity — such as family history and assets — that are otherwise hard to measure.</p>
<p>In this new study, Joshua Rivenbark from Duke University and colleagues got around this issue by following more than 1,000 sets of same-sex twins growing up in a range of areas in the UK, from the most to the least deprived, over the first 20 years of their lives. The team measured the socioeconomic status of the families using a variety of measures, including information about parental education, occupation and income. They also gauged the <em>subjective</em> social status of their child participants at the ages of 12 and 18, by giving them an image of a ladder with five rungs and asking them to choose the rung which they felt best represented their family’s socioeconomic position relative to others across the UK. At various stages of the twins’ childhoods, the researchers also collected information about their health, attitudes and behaviours from the individuals themselves and their parents and schoolteachers. Now, for the first time, scientists could look at siblings raised at the same time in the same family and ask the critical question: <em>Do differences in their perceived social standing really matter?</em></p>
<p>It turned out that siblings could substantially disagree on their family’s social standing — a difference which had its consequences. At the age of 18, those who rated their family status as lower experienced significantly more mental health difficulties than their siblings, including depression, anxiety, conduct problems and pessimism about the future. In fact, subjective status was ten times better at predicting incidences of depression than objective socioeconomic status, and three times better at predicting anxiety. At age 12, differences between siblings weren’t related to differences in well-being, suggesting that subjective status begins to matter only in later adolescence — perhaps as teenagers mature and become more aware of their family’s standing.</p>
<p>Does this mean that perceptions of social standing might actually be more critical for an adolescent’s mental well-being than the physical resources and opportunities that come with that standing? This study might be the strongest evidence so far that this is the case.</p>
<p>There is another possibility: the relationship between perceived status and well-being might actually run in reverse. Compared to the sibling with better mental well-being, an 18-year-old experiencing internal struggles might simply be constructing a different narrative about their family’s social status. As teenagers grow to become <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.83">more attuned</a> to social comparisons and hierarchies, they might be more likely to interpret their level of well-being — or lack thereof — through the lens of having a particular social standing.</p>
<p>In the future, we can begin to figure out the arrow of causality by asking children about their perceptions more frequently over the course of their development. Regardless of the direction of this arrow, however, it is clear that social hierarchies are a fundamental part of the human psyche. Even if our perceived place in the pecking order merely reflects our well-being rather than actually causing it, this only reveals the fact that we assume our social position has such power.</p>

<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8211-1">Our research study</a> published today in <em>BMC Public Health</em> describes the perspectives of bereaved relatives like those portrayed in this vignette, and provides examples of conflicts between their need for privacy and journalists’ need to do their job. Among the 140 suicide-bereaved relatives or friends who responded to our online survey, many described perceptions of journalists’ intrusive behavior, a failure to consult them appropriately, and inaccuracy in reporting. However, some individuals described the press coverage as an opportunity to raise awareness and prevent further suicides.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11691" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/samaritans-volunteer-image-1-for-jan18-issue-300x184.jpeg" width="300" />Samaritans has published <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">media guidelines on how to safely report on suicide </a>and additional <a href="https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Media_guidelines_-_Working_with_bereaved_families_factsheet_UK_Final.pdf">guidance on working with bereaved families</a>, to protect bereaved relatives from unnecessary distress, as well as protecting the public from the potential harms of irresponsible reporting. This is important because research shows that people bereaved by suicide are at <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2215-0366(14)70224-X">greater risk of suicide</a> themselves, and insensitive reporting can increase their distress. It is also important because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066401/">irresponsible reporting is implicated in inducing further suicides</a>. Supporting the media to report on suicide responsibly is a key feature of <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/preventing-suicide-a-global-imperative">public health policy on suicide prevention</a>.</p>
<p>Public health researchers recognize that journalists find themselves in a difficult position when expected to report on someone’s suicide, whether the deceased was in the public eye or otherwise. On reading our research findings Lorna Fraser, Samaritans’ Media Advice Service lead, commented:</p>
<p>“Reporting suicides can be one of the most challenging issues journalists face, where they must balance reporting a topic which is in the public interest, with avoiding any intrusion into the grief and shock of the bereaved loved ones left behind. It’s vitally important that journalists are aware of media guidelines and follow this best practice advice, due to the many sensitivities and risks surrounding this topic. We regularly hear from bereaved families with concerns about approaches from journalists and a lack of sensitivity with how their loved one’s death was reported. We ask journalists to bear in mind these are people who may be in shock and struggling to come to terms with their devastating loss. They may not even be aware that their relative’s death will be reported in the press. Many will consider this a personal issue and value the space to grieve in private. In addition to our media guidelines, Samaritans provides an advice service to media. Journalists can email us at: <a href="mailto:mediaadvice@samaritans.org">mediaadvice@samaritans.org</a>.”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11692 alignleft" height="135" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/supportaftersuicide-300x135.png" width="300" />Sarah Bates, Executive Lead of the <a href="https://supportaftersuicide.org.uk/">Support after Suicide Partnership</a> added “Suicide is absolutely devastating, and insensitive reporting of suicide can have a hugely damaging impact on both people directly affected by the death being reported, as well as anyone who has had a similar experience in the past, sometimes going back many years. At the same time, the press face real challenges when reporting on suicide in the public interest. There is such a need for responsible, informed, and sensitive reporting, consistent with <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">Samaritans media guidelines</a>. Reporting must put the grieving family, friends, colleagues and professionals at the heart of every journalists’ approach. As Lorna mentions, journalists are often involved very soon after a death is reported, often before support services are able to establish a relationship with a grieving family. Therefore, the journalist may suggest that the family nominate a ‘spokesperson’ who can act as a bridge between the press and those most impacted – and have honest, open, and sensitive communication.  We feel that some of the vital aspects to responsible reporting include not giving too much detail when mentioning method or location, avoiding unnecessary use of images and always making sure that readers are directed towards the support that is available.”</p>
<p><a href="https://mybrotherkilledhimself.wordpress.com/about/">Emma Bird</a>, a journalist and blogger who has experienced suicide bereavement herself, commented:  “I welcome this research. Having lost my brother to suicide, I am now an unquestionably better journalist than I was before he died. I have the qualities that good journalists are supposed to have: I’m a good listener, I’m empathetic and people confide in me. But even so, if I had known back then what I know now, I wouldn’t have made such a hash up of door knocks and inquests. I have no qualms about suicides being reported but this must be done in a way that is sensitive to the bereaved and with an awareness for what they are going through.”</p>
<p>A key message of our research is that if the right approach is taken, journalists can potentially collaborate with bereaved relatives to write a story that both respects the bounds of their privacy and avoids misrepresenting the deceased. Additionally, by providing information on how to contact appropriate local and national sources of support, a news article can encourage people experiencing emotional problems or suicidal thoughts to seek help. In this way, journalism can be used to positive ends, reducing the potential for distress to relatives and enhancing communication of suicide prevention messages.</p>

<p>I’m a neuroscientist by trade. Popular culture would most likely label me ‘<em>logical, detail-oriented and analytical’ </em>(which I am!)</p>
<p>BUT when I was in high school, I considered applying to art school and pursuing a career as a painter. And I dabble in botanical watercolour and love designing in Canva. You could also label me <em>‘creative, thoughtful and artistic.’</em></p>
<p>No doubt you’ve heard the concept that the left side of the brain is logical and analytical, whereas the right side of the brain is artistic and creative.</p>
<p>Maybe you even landed on this article because you googled the phrase and arrived here? (You’re very welcome!!).</p>
<p>The idea is that personality or cognitive processes (ways of thinking) are cultivated on one side of the brain or other, giving rise to the rather nifty idea that you are right-brained <em>or</em> left-brained, creative <em>or</em> analytical … neuroscientist <em>or</em> artist.</p>
<h2>No evidence from brain scans that people are ‘rig<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-6157 alignleft" height="228" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brain-2062057_1920-300x228.jpg" style="color: #555555; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;" width="300" />ht-brained’ versus ‘left-brained’.</h2>
<p>This popular notion was debunked in 2013 by University of Utah neuroscientists who used brain imaging to show <em>there is NO evidence that people are ‘right-brained’ or ‘left-brained’. </em></p>
<p>A team from the University of Utah scanned the brains of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. They used a technique called resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI)… forget about that mouthful for now. The study tested the idea that one half of a person’s brain is more active, more connected and more synchronised than the other.</p>
<p>The team divided each person’s brain into over 7,000 regions and examined each region to see if it showed stronger activity on the left or the right side of the brain. They also looked for connections between regions that were more localised (also called ‘lateralised’) to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<p>Because, as Jared Nielsen, a PhD student who worked on the study, said</p>
<blockquote><p>…we just don’t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neuroscientist Dr Jeff Anderson, lead author of the study, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right.</p>
<p>But people don’t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network.</p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px;">How did the left-brain vs right-brain myth come about?</span></h2>
<p>The two hemispheres of the brain are <i>slightly</i> different anatomically and microscopically (which means they look a bit different when you look at them with your eyes and down the microscope).</p>
<p>And, the two hemispheres of the brain (connected by the corpus callosum) do perform different jobs. In the industry, we call this lateralisation of brain function. Lateralisation is the tendency for some neural functions or processes to be specialised to one side of the brain or the other</p>
<p>For example, the left side of the brain controls movement on the right side of the body and vice-versa. Speech and language, are typically jobs performed by the left hemisphere. But not <em>ALL</em> aspects of speech are left-sided. Intonation, for example, is found on the right. As an interesting aside…language and ‘handed-ness’ are related. Whereas 97% of right-handed people have their speech centre on the left, only 70% of left-handers do.</p>
<p>Also, studies of patients with tumours or stroke show that our sense of our body and limbs in space (proprioception) is more likely located in the right hemisphere.</p>
<p>Some neuroscientists theorise that these differences and the brain asymmetries of language, spatial perception and handedness probably led to the prevailing myth that personality and styles of thinking are also located to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<h2>But what if <em>I AM</em> a right-brain creative type?</h2>
<p>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has talents, and everyone has weaknesses they need to work on.</p>
<p>Recognise and foster your talents. Set goals and develop new skills.</p>
<p>Just don’t attribute ‘whole brain’, global functions or personality or career choices to one hemisphere of the brain being weaker or stronger than the other. The brain is way more complex (and interesting) than that!</p>
<h2>Is there a problem with using left-brain versus right-brain … just for fun?</h2>
<p>One problem that has arisen from this mythology is the raft of books, tests, apps, workshops and online games that exploit the myth by promising to help you ‘tap into your creative right brain’.</p>
<p>Fine — if you want to spend your money on them and expand on skills and knowledge that you may not already have. BUT this simplistic right-brained vs left-brained view is not grounded in our contemporary understanding of how the brain works.</p>
<p>Also, believing that you are ‘creative but not analytical’, or ‘logical and unintuitive’ and that is hard-wired into your brain, is a rather limiting belief and probably becomes self-fulfilling after a while.</p>
<p>Christian Jarrett who writes for Psychology Today sums my thoughts up perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose the logical left-brain, creative right-brain myth has a seductive simplicity about it. People can ask – which kind of brain have I got? They can buy an app to target their weaker half. They can categorise languages and people as right-brained or left.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to combat that belief system by saying the truth is really more complicated. But it’s worth trying, because it would be a shame if the simplistic myth drowned out the more fascinating story of how our brains really work.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/R0F4q7pU-O0/">PLOS and the University of California announce open access publishing agreement</a></h4>

<p><em>Note: PLOS and the University of California issued the following press release on Wednesday, February 19th at 9:00am PST.</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the University of California (UC) today announced a two-year agreement that will make it easier and more affordable for UC researchers to publish in the nonprofit open access publisher’s suite of journals. By bringing together PLOS, one of the world’s leading native open access publishers, and UC, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all U.S. publishing output, the pilot breaks new ground in the global movement to advance open access publishing and empower more authors to share their research with the world.</p>
<p>“Scientific research is increasingly an international endeavor, often at its best when it crosses conceptual, disciplinary, and technological boundaries,” said Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy and Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology at UC San Francisco, and a member of the PLOS Board of Directors. “Building that global continuum of discovery demands open, efficient, and rapid distribution of information. This agreement shows that key institutional stakeholders — universities and publishers — can work cooperatively to develop sustainable models that serve science, scientists, and trainees.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which the partners are working to implement this spring, the UC Libraries will automatically pay the first $1,000 of the article processing charge (APC) for all UC authors who choose to publish in a PLOS journal. Authors who do not have research funds available can request full funding of the article processing charge from the libraries, ensuring that lack of research funds does not present a barrier for UC authors who wish to publish in PLOS journals.</p>
<p>The pilot will illustrate that an institutional participation model that leverages multiple funding sources, rather than only grant funds, can enable a sustainable and inclusive path to full open access.</p>
<p>“This agreement is the result of open and fully collaborative discussions,” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “Open access publishers and libraries are natural allies, and we’re thrilled our first agreement is with UC, given their reputation for strong action supporting open access in the market. Open access is evolving. We have a duty to meet those changing needs with solutions that ensure the future of open access is accessible for all.”</p>
<p>Most institutional agreements have so far focused on subscription publishers that are transitioning to open access. PLOS and UC believe that institutional agreements of this kind can and should include native open access publishers since they are already aligned with current and emerging OA policies and mandates. This pilot builds upon UC’s commitment to a level playing field that supports all authors and all publishers in alignment with the <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/guidelines-for-evaluating-transformative-open-access-agreements/">university’s guidelines for evaluating transformative agreements</a>.</p>
<p>“UC and PLOS have a long and close relationship as leaders in open access publishing — and this pilot builds on that partnership,” said Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of UC’s California Digital Library and co-chair of the team overseeing UC’s publisher negotiations. “We want to make it easier and more affordable for researchers to choose open access journals like PLOS when deciding where to submit their work for publication. We intend to continue to partner with a variety of publishers so that together we can help lead the transition to full open access.”</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about the paper "Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself, in driving network-
wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of neuronal activity, we study how autaptic
connections affect activity patterns, and evaluate if controllability significantly affects changes in
bursting from autaptic connections. Adding more autaptic connections to excitatory neurons increased
the number of spiking events and the number of network-wide bursts. We observed excitatory synapses
contributed more to bursting behavior than inhibitory synapses. We evaluated if neurons with high
average controllability, predicted to push the network into easily achievable states, affected bursting
behavior differently than neurons with high modal controllability, thought to influence the network
into difficult to reach states. Results show autaptic connections to excitatory neurons with high average
controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding the same number of self-looping connections
to neurons with high modal controllability. The number of autapses required to induce bursting was
lowered by adding autapses to high degree excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic
connections in controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of mammalian
brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic neurophysiological correlates of
structural controllability.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>You’re exhausted. You’ve had a long day at work before coming home to make dinner, do some chores and relax, and now it’s time for bed. But for some reason — despite the fact you’ve been struggling to stay awake all day — you can’t quite bring yourself to stop what you’re doing and go to sleep.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, you’ll be pleased to hear that you’re not the only one who lacks willpower when it’s time to go to bed. It’s so widespread, in fact, that Katharina Bernecker from the Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien and Veronika Job at the Technical University of Dresden have investigated what could be driving the phenomenon <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12382?af=R">in a new paper</a> published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39173"></span></p>
<p>Bernecker and Job believed that our failure to drag ourselves to bed at night is a failure of self-control: for some reason, we can’t muster the willpower needed to do what we need to do. Furthermore, they posited that our <em>beliefs</em> about our own willpower may predict how long we spend procrastinating before bed.</p>
<p>The team issued questionnaires to 173 college-age participants. First, participants were asked to agree or disagree with a number of statements, each reflecting one of two theories of willpower. Those who believe in the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/24/new-research-challenges-the-idea-that-willpower-is-a-limited-resource/">“limited” theory</a> see willpower as a finite resource: once you’ve used it up, it’s gone until it is replenished by relaxation or sleep. Proponents of the “non-limited” theory, on the other hand, believe willpower can be tapped into at any time using self-control.</p>
<p>Participants also rated their own levels of self-control, and indicated whether they thought of themselves or a morning or evening person. They were also asked what their ideal bedtime would be.</p>
<p>After this initial questionnaire, participants completed daily diaries for ten days. Surveys were sent out each morning, measuring what time participants had gone to sleep the previous night (as opposed to when they went to <em>bed</em>), when they had woken up and how high quality their sleep was. Levels of stress were also measured. The last questionnaire of the ten measured bedtime procrastination, asking participants to select on a five point scale whether they are more likely to go to bed later than intended or to go to bed early.</p>
<p>The results suggested that theories of willpower do, in fact, influence how much people procrastinate before bed. Those with a non-limited theory of willpower were far less likely to procrastinate on highly stressful days, while those with a limited theory of willpower procrastinated for around 40-50 mins regardless of how stressful their day was.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the effect in adolescents. A total of 137 seventh, eighth and ninth grade students were given pen and paper surveys each morning in class for four days. Information was also gathered on self-control and willpower theories.</p>
<p>Teens may have parents telling them to go to bed, but the results suggest that sleep procrastination is still a significant problem: on average, students taking part in the study missed their ideal bedtime by an hour and a half.</p>
<p>And, as the first study had found, stress and willpower theories had a combined impact on when students were going to bed. Those who believed in the limited theory procrastinated more on stressful days — thus impacting how long they slept, and often the quality of their sleep — while those with the non-limited theory didn’t show any difference between high and low stress days.</p>
<p>What we don’t know — and what this research doesn’t quite touch on — is exactly <em>why</em> people who believe that we have a limited reserve of mental energy get the urge to procrastinate before bed when stressed. Logically, if they’ve had a bad or stressful day, they should be happy to get into bed. But, according to these results, they are more likely to prolong their day instead.</p>
<p>The team has a few suggestions as to why this is. Firstly, those who subscribe to the limited theory may feel they need more time to recover from a stressful day, thus spending more time on relaxing or mindless activities like watching TV. These activities also have the added benefit of providing instant gratification: yes, we might feel refreshed after a good night’s sleep, but we have to wait eight hours for that. If we sit on the internet for a bit longer, we get that hit immediately.</p>
<p>Gaining a better understanding of what people are doing to procrastinate may also be useful: some may be relaxing, whilst others may be catching up on a work overflow from a stressful day. Working out what exactly it is we get from these activities may be a good first step on the road to a better night’s sleep.</p>

<h2>The three facts about the teenage brain scholars can agree on</h2>
<p><em>1. Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood.</em> Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</p>
<p><em>2. Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’.</em> But boys catch up. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</p>
<p><em>3. Different brain regions mature at different rates.</em> Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</p>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as an experienced decision-maker. The PFC is involved direction attention, judgement calls, emotion regulation, strategy, impulse control, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC thickens as neurons make new connections or synapses. Much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots.</p>
<p>However, during the teens, PFC <em>thinning</em> occurs. Loss or ‘thinning’ of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions teens experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/hH8cw6_ccK8/">Our communities keep us moving forward</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/02/ContributorThankYou_twitter-1-150x150.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At PLOS, every article is a collaboration. Our expert editorial boards and guest editors work in partnership with reviewers to provide accurate assessment and shape articles for publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the support of these thousands of individual researchers PLOS would not be the home for rigorous, insightful research that it is. For all of the work they’ve contributed over the past year, we just want to say THANK YOU to our Editorial Boards, Guest Editors, and Reviewers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Collaboration leads to success</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS journals are driven by researchers for the benefit of the entire scientific community. With their support and feedback, we’ve been exploring how we can make the publishing process more transparent, fair, and efficient for all of the researchers who rely on us to share their work. We saw many of those goals come to life in 2019.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowered authors and reviewers to opt-in and reveal the expert assessment that shapes each published article. Combined with </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we also expanded opportunities for reviewer credit in order to increase recognition for this essential contribution to the research process. We also joined the </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pilot along with 12 other journals and launched a </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint commenting trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make early, public peer review feedback available during the assessment process. Both of these pilots we hope will make the review process clearer, faster, and more robust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our volunteer Editorial Boards and Guest Editors worked together across geographies, timezones, and disciplines to launch 30+ </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/s/calls-for-papers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for Papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and of highly focused research. Across all of our journals, we press-released nearly 400 papers, helping ensure that authors reach the widest possible audience, and the communities where their work has the most impact.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>More to come in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re only a few months into the new year and we’ve already started off with the launch of Registered Reports on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which we hope will empower researchers to tell the story of their research in a way that more accurately reflects the process of scientific discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off the progress we made in 2019, we’ll be carefully monitoring these new initiatives with more to report as the programs develop. And we’ll continue looking for new opportunities to break boundaries and change the publication landscape in the ways that matter most to our communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we just want to take a moment to recognize how tremendous this set of accomplishments was for 2019–with equally ambitious plans for 2020. Nothing we’ve done would have been possible without so many researchers dedicating their time and expertise to PLOS and we want to say thank you for your continued support. We couldn’t do it without you!</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">How I got a job in industry</a></h4>

<p>I often get asked how I landed a job in industry after my postdoc. After my PhD at McGill, I started a postdoc at UCLA in July 2014. After about 6 months, like many a postdoc, I started to get worried about my financial security and academic job prospects. So I started exploring jobs outside of academia. Here’s my short guide to getting a job in industry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>Getting a recruiter on the line</h3>
<p>I dusted off my CV and arranged it in a way that I thought would highlight hot marketable trends and skills. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx66dpl39b0hdoz/pro-cv-machinelearningresearcher.pdf?dl=0">You can see what it looked like</a>. I had many versions going around but they were all fairly similar. Looking at the CV now it’s pretty clear that I was keyword stuffing and I could have cut down the content by 30%. UML! Numeric C! Actionscript! Deep learning! Please hire me I know computer things!</p>
<p>Three types of people will look at your CV (and LinkedIn profile):</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruiters. They are the gatekeepers.</li>
<li>Engineers and researchers who will not interview you (for some specialized roles only). They’ll look at the CVs the recruiters send their way and decide whether you’re a fit.</li>
<li>Engineers that are interviewing you and might ask questions about something listed on your CV.</li>
</ul>
<p>People agonize over how their CVs are arranged, but honestly, I think the only thing that matters is 1) the algorithm that ranks you on LinkedIn and puts you in front of recruiters and 2) making the content not aggravating by engineers that will actually have printed your CV. My CV definitely optimized for the first thing although at that time I had no clue.</p>
<p>Why you get calls or not and from whom is completely opaque to me. When you’re often on LinkedIn and update your CV an ML pipeline probably picks it up and marks you as actively looking for a job and gives you a higher ranking in searches. You can also mark yourself as actively looking for a job. I also presume that some recruiters have lists of <em>hot</em> universities where they look for candidates – UCLA is a hotspot for math research – Terrance Tao is there – so I assume, I got contacted by a lot of finance recruiters.</p>
<p>Something else that might have tipped the balance is that I used to do development professionally before grad school, and ran an open-source project. It probably also helped that I’d been working in Python on and off since 2006. I put that in the CV as well. So I was also getting contacted by tech recruiters.</p>
<h3>The thing about recruiters is…</h3>
<p>Recruiters get paid a substantial commission when a candidate gets hired. They have to sift through a sea a people who are just looking, are a poor fit, or who will ultimately bomb the interview. Generally, they tend not to be technical people (although some recruiters are quite technically inclined especially for more specialized roles). You will get a lot of emails about things that are seemingly unrelated to your skills.</p>
<p>If you have a good rapport with a recruiter they can be real buds and advocate for you when finding a job. They will prep you for interviews and give you a lot of guidance you need in these scary times. They’re also generally nice people since they have to deal with people a lot. So, be nice to recruiters.</p>
<h3>The types of jobs out there</h3>
<p>I was getting cold-called about a lot of different jobs with adult-sounding titles and I didn’t quite know what they meant at the time.</p>
<p>They included things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research scientist: the closest thing to postdoc or PI in industry. Develop your own research agenda. Sweet gig. Stressful.</li>
<li>Research engineer: someone who can code research ideas. If working on ML, that might mean being really good with CUDA. Two people you might know who are in research engineer roles: Francois Chollet (Keras) and Soumith Chintala (PyTorch)</li>
<li>Software engineer: in a tech company, a jack-of-all-trades position that can run the gamut from doing kernel stuff to writing JS for a front-end app to doing pipelines on exabyte datasets. Highly respected at tech companies, drives a lot of the research. At a finance company, someone who writes C++, not so highly respected.</li>
<li>Data scientist: in some places, especially big tech companies, a statistician (or, rarely, a washed-up computational neuroscientist). In others, a programmer who works on data pipelines and does a bit of stats and maybe ML. Extremely variable role.</li>
<li>Quant: a data scientist of the statistician variety or maybe ML in a finance firm.</li>
<li>Data engineer: someone who does the piping on exabyte datasets but not the stats.</li>
<li>Business Intelligence: someone who does stuff in Excel.</li>
<li>Consultant: I’ve asked people many times what a consultant does and have yet to figure it out. I’m pretty sure it’s someone with an MBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of title inflation in startups. CTO! Senior architect! These titles are only really meaningful when you start to have a medium-sized business (past series A, at least 50 employees), and even then it’s almost entirely made up. It varies tremendously from place to place. On the other hand, at a place like Google, a senior software engineer means a very specific thing – with a level, a comp, years of experience, etc. So unless you’re applying for a big company don’t worry too much about the title – and at a big company they will determine your level anyway, so don’t worry about it either.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other jobs out there for a person with a PhD, like a teacher, science communicator, or dog photographer to the stars – these just happen to be the jobs that I was getting calls about.</p>
<p>One thing you need to be aware of is that even within one company there can be multiple pipelines for hiring, especially for research. If you interview for a general software engineering job at Google you’re unlikely to get matched to Google Brain; Brain has its own posted job offers which generally have research-something-or-other in their title. Candidates will often try to get in through the front door (in tech companies, as a software engineer) and get transferred to a research job within a couple of years. I know a lot of very smart people who went through this route, it is definitely possible, but it’s a gamble. However, if you just want to be considered for a research job you can also make it clear to your recruiter; just know that those jobs are a lot harder to get.</p>
<h3>Prepping for interviews</h3>
<p>Generally, you’ll get a prep call with a recruiter, and then a phone screen. In a phone screen, they’ll ask you technical questions that are sufficiently straightforward that they can be answered in a shared google doc or over the phone. These questions may be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms and data structures (for a software engineering role)</li>
<li>System design (software)</li>
<li>Basic stats (data science)</li>
<li>Basic finance math (finance)</li>
<li>ML (research position)</li>
<li>Are you a good person or someone who will make work miserable? (behavioural questions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your recruiter will help you prep for the phone screen, however, the book everybody recommends is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>. This gives you prep questions about algorithms (highly specific to SWE jobs and tech jobs in general) and about behaviour (good to remember).</p>
<p>People give preparing for technical interviews a bad reputation. It’s a lot like GREs – you can either use it as an opportunity to brush up on your knowledge, and love it, or it can feel like a miserable slog. I personally loved it. Being self-taught in programming, I had never done anything theoretical data structures and algorithms, so I was really happy to go through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms and Data Structures with Tim Roughgarden</a>. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that it was life-changing – a revelation. All of a sudden the range of problems that I could tackle with code blew up.</p>
<p>I also followed an edX curriculum on data science, which I didn’t like as much. I felt like I already knew most of the theoretical things that were taught and the rest wasn’t very useful to me at the time (using Spark). In hindsight, it introduced me to out-of-core computation, pandas and ggplot, so it was actually very useful.</p>
<p>I went to a data science meetup in LA and met somebody (now a friend) who wanted to work on a Kaggle problem together. I learned a lot from that (it’s probably the first time I used sklearn!). We finished in the top 5% so I also had something to put on my CV about my supposed knowledge of machine learning.</p>
<p>I also picked up a book on portfolio theory for finance interviews. Give yourself a solid 4-8 weeks to prep for your interviews, and do a little bit of prep every day, with a sprint on the weekends.</p>
<h3>Styles of interviews</h3>
<p>I mostly dealt with run-of-the-mill whiteboard interviews (standard for tech jobs but also common for finance). Read the coding interview book to figure out how these work. I had other types of interviews/screens as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take home assignments. Common for data science. Don’t be too smart and don’t take longer than you should. If you bomb it’s great practice for the next one.</li>
<li>Timed exams in secret bunker locations. I had a few of these for finance. Nerve-wracking.</li>
<li>Presentations. If about your own research, don’t pander by throwing in buzzwords; just do it like an academic talk. If about their problem (linked to take-home assignment), doing one creative thing is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a friend who got asked a Fermi estimation question! I’ve never gotten one of those, but I really wish I did – they’re super fun.</p>
<h3>Bombing different interviews</h3>
<p>I have a friend who is trying to date better so as guy-who-has-dated (I’m married now) I recommended that she go on a different date every night for a whole week. The idea is you to push yourself out of the scarcity mentality (there’s no one out there for me) and move towards an abundance mentality (there are too many people out there for me! I better be selective!). What I failed to warn her about is that if you do that you will also inevitably have a lot of failed awkward dates, which is part of the often arbitrary, fickle process of dating.</p>
<p>I had a lot of failed, awkward interviews. I flew to London for a two-day interview with a finance company (one of their researchers had been a PhD student with David Mackay! I love London!). I did ok on the technical questions but completely bombed my interview once I inquired about their policy for publishing research (most finance places don’t allow you to publish, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6114424">with some notable exceptions</a>).</p>
<p>I had an interview in Chicago with another finance company (I stayed in the fancy Trump Hotel! I wore a suit and tie! Pre-2016 was different!). I did ok on the technical and they just had one more interview loop – a 4-hour behavioural interview with a psychologist in a hotel next to LAX! I started crying around the one-hour mark when he started asking about my relationship with my dad (he passed away in 2008 and I never really got over it). I never really recovered after that. But then I got a free therapy session out of it so there’s that.</p>
<p>There was an interview with a secretive Bay Area ML stealth-mode startup, where I showed some monkey physiology research to a confused crowd during lunchtime. I can still remember the smell of the lemon salmon in that room.</p>
<p>There was that one time I brushed off the CTO of an LA startup when he asked about whether I had cross-validated my results. I was like – would I show results if they weren’t cross-validated? Apparently, a lot of candidates did! There was one time I spent 2 hours out of a three-hour technical test debugging some weird corner issue in pandas that was causing my ipython kernel to crash on their sample dataset.</p>
<p>Every interview you will become a little bit better and a little stronger. Pace yourself.</p>
<h3>Showing your best self</h3>

<li>Don’t be a jerk – sometimes people ask seemingly dumb questions because a lot of people in their applicant pool can’t answer these questions. If you answer as though a question is beneath you, that’s a huge red flag.</li>
<li>Keep talking and you’ll be fine. The number one mistake people do in whiteboard interviews is they freeze when they don’t know the answer. One thing that saved me in one interview is starting to talk about an almost completely unrelated problem where I found that you could solve it in O(sqrt(N)) memory because of a scheme I had thought was pretty clever. The interviewer seemed to agree that it was pretty clever and helped me make that scheme work for the problem on the whiteboard.</li>
<li>If it’s because it became clear that a business isn’t a good fit after a phone screen, don’t feel obligated to keep going. Your interviewers will feel relief when they see "interview canceled" and you haven’t wasted their time. Once you realize that exciting startup is really "Uber, but for dogs" (actual phone pitch), you can just say thanks but no thanks.</li>
<li>Don’t be a jerk.Seriously, people won’t want to work with you if you’re a jerk.</li>
<li>Practice makes perfect. One rejection is sad. 10 rejections isn’t. Get back on the horse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the most humiliating part for me is that I was broke and I had to ask for reimbursement after rejections sometimes. I had lost my passport for a couple of months so I had to take the bus from LA to SF for some Bay Area interviews. Imagine my sad sad emails asking for reimbursing 50$ for a bus ticket. I still cringe thinking about it.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>After failing many times I ended up in a software engineer (SWE) interview at Google, kept my composure and said good enough words in approximately the right order. It took about 5 months from "I need a job" to "I have a job offer".</p>
<p>At that point you’ll have to deal with acquiring a work visa if you’re not in your own country. In the US that means getting an H1B which is brutal – these days H1Bs get handed out once a year and they don’t fill all the requests so you might have to wait a couple years in a remote office to actually get to your dream job. It’s no joke! As a Canadian though it’s easy peasy – show up at the border, get visa. The company will pay for your visa.</p>
<p>There’s negotiation over comp but the only way to get better comp in many places is to have a competing offer, and I didn’t know that so I took the offer they gave me. That was 4.5X was I was making as a postdoc so I couldn’t fathom asking for more anyway. Job offer to job start took 3 months because of the visa wait and finishing the last bit of my postdoc.</p>
<h3>Silicon Valley things</h3>
<p>The giant tech companies have vastly different ratings on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/best-tech-companies-2019/">employer ratings sites</a> (i.e. Glassdoor), and this reflects that these places have vastly different cultures that may or may not lead to thriving happy humans. Facebook and Google always make the top 5. You’ll have to scroll down a lot to see Apple, and Amazon and Netflix are nowhere to be seen. A lot of Facebook early employees came from Google and they share a lot of the same don’t-be-a-jerk culture. Apple is secretive and that can make it isolating. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">Amazon is grueling according to the nytimes</a>. Read the reviews before you sign an offer!</p>
<p>For a postdoc it might be easier to go to a giant tech company than a highly specialized startup. I didn’t have a lot of marketable real world skills at this point. I distinctly remember being completely lost during Noogler training when they taught us about their source control and having to ask the guy next to me how to use their command line source control tool. His answer: it’s like the git command line. Next question: how does the git command line work? I had only used the GUI!</p>
<p>Big tech companies will take a chance on someone who’s smart and willing to be trained. Startups generally want someone who is productive on day one (spoiler: I was not productive on day one). Then you learn a bunch of stuff and you get to put <em>giant tech company</em> on your resume. People suddenly reply to your emails. It’s a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>At big tech companies, most jobs get hired into a big pool and they’ll figure out your team later. Yeah! Weird system right? I matched with a team almost entirely at random and ended up in what turned out was the perfect spot – with a bunch of statisticians. I learned a lot of stats!</p>
<p>There’s a lot of internal mobility and it’s in everyone’s interest to land in a place where you can eventually be productive and do something interesting. After about three months at Google it was pretty clear that I was no Jeff Dean but I was a pretty sharp data scientist and I knew a thing or two about visual perception so I ended up doing a mix of both.</p>
<p>Of course once you’ve got that first job, it’s a lot easier to get a job elsewhere, and people recommend switching jobs every 18 to 24 months to maximize your compensation. I was a lot wiser for the second round, and when a recruiter from Facebook contacted me about a data engineer job, I told them I was only interested in the brain-computer interface work that I had read about in an <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/01/12/facebook-job-postings-building-8/">news article</a>. That was a highly specialized gig so I went through a completely different – and much faster – pipeline. It took a couple of weeks from initial call to offer, and I was way less stressed because I had been through the ringer.</p>
<p>So that’s how I did it. AMA.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/18/sexist-ideologies-may-help-cultivate-the-dark-triad-of-personality-traits/">Sexist Ideologies May Help Cultivate The “Dark Triad” Of Personality Traits</a></h4>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>The “dark triad” of personality traits — narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism — do not make for the nicest individuals. People who score highly on the dark triad are vain, callous and manipulative. They adopt a so-called “fast-life” strategy, characterised by impulsivity, opportunism and selfishness. Such individuals can succeed in the workplace, while failing to get on with others. They’re also more likely to cheat on their partners, and are deemed more alluring <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/29/how-do-people-with-dark-triad-personality-traits-fare-at-speed-dating/">in speed-dating sessions</a>.</p>
<p>Though these traits can bring advantages to the individual, they are clearly detrimental to those around them. So it’s important to understand what fosters them. Could particular attitudes in society, for example, help to encourage these dark traits?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919306683?via=ihub">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, concludes that this may in fact be the case. Melissa Gluck at the University of Florida and her colleagues gathered evidence suggesting that sexism — “and the socially-supported, unearned male power and privilege that sexism reflects” — is linked to higher scores on measures of the dark triad. “If scholars can demonstrate that these malevolent traits are partly learned by growing up in sexist cultures, agents of personal and social change can help people recognise, understand, alter and replace these malevolent aspects of humanity,” the researchers write.</p>
<p><span id="more-39165"></span></p>
<p>Gluck and her colleagues recruited 295 adults living in the US (131 women, 164 men) to complete online two measures of dark traits, plus a sexism inventory. This inventory gauged endorsement of statements that reflect two separate facets of sexism: so-called “hostile sexism” (e.g. “Women seek to gain power by getting control over men”) and “benevolent”, patronising sexism (e.g. “A good woman should be set on a pedestal by her man”). Brief demographic data was also collected from each participant.</p>
<p>As predicted, based on earlier findings, the men scored higher for dark traits than the women. Also as expected, the men displayed more sexism, of both types. For both men and women, there was a correlation between their overall sexism scores and their dark triad ratings, and among the men, but not the women, it was hostile sexism that really accounted for this link. Overall, the difference between the men’s and the women’s dark trait scores was “substantially, but not completely” attributable to sexism, the researchers write.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, tackling sexist ideology, and hostile sexist ideology in particular, would also affect levels of these dark traits in society?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But it’s impossible to know from this study whether sexist ideology is encouraging narcissism, callousness and manipulativeness, or whether people with these traits are more likely to adopt sexist attitudes. Alternatively, as the researchers note, something else might conceivably drive the development of both dark traits and sexism. This might be childhood trauma, perhaps, or living in a culture that focuses on individual rather than group success.</p>
<p>For now, Gluck and her colleagues argue that sexism should at least be considered as a cause. They write: “The origins of the dark traits are still debatable, but these data support the utility of exploring the impact of sexism and dysfunctional aspects of traditional gender beliefs on the development and maintenance of dark traits.”</p>

<p>What do we know about men’s experiences of grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss? And what are the factors/predictors that contribute to men’s grief? <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2677-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Philippa Middleton and co-workers in a paper published</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> set out to answer these two questions by performing a systematic review of the existing literature.</p>
<p>The majority of previous research and subsequent pregnancy/neonatal loss bereavement care guidelines have focused primarily on the experiences and needs of heterosexual mothers. Fewer studies and recommendations relate to men’s experiences of grief and subsequent support needs. Given the potential for detrimental health and well being outcomes among men following pregnancy/neonatal loss, it is essential to further understand how men grieve, and the factors that contribute to worsened or improved outcomes.</p>
<p>The researchers identified 46 relevant studies investigating men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss. By definition, this included the death of a baby at any stage in-utero, or up to 28 days after a live birth. Twenty-one studies investigated grief experiences following miscarriage (definitions which ranged between ≤20–24 weeks’ gestation), 10 following stillbirth, and 15 following a combination of loss types. Nineteen studies were quantitative, 26 qualitative and 1 was a mixed methods study. All studies were conducted in high-income countries, and male participants were heterosexual men who experienced pregnancy loss with a female partner.</p>
<p>The main findings of both quantitative and qualitative studies revealed the highly varied and individual nature of men’s grief. Although men’s grief was less intense compared to women’s in some quantitative studies, qualitative studies identified the significant impact of loss on men. In contrast to stereotypes that men intellectualize or rationalize their grief, studies also found that men do grieve on an emotional level. They may also oscillate between problem-focused coping and emotional expressions of grief, as reflected in the dual-process model of coping. However, men’s experiences also appeared to be consistent with the theory of disenfranchised grief, with a general silence surrounding pregnancy loss contributing to feelings of isolation and worsened grief.</p>
<p>The study also sought to identify predictors of grief. At an individual level there were mixed findings relating to demographic factors, suggesting that these have not been well-explored. Similarly, personality qualities may play a key role in predicting grief, although further research is required to confirm causality. However, in contrast to early assumptions that men only develop an attachment to the developing baby as gestation increases, the results suggested that attachment at any level is an important predictor of grief.</p>
<p>Men’s interactions with others seem to play a pivotal role in how they experience grief. The quality of the couple relationship contributed to either a positive source of support that helped the grief process, or a negative source of added stress which increased the impact of the loss. Grief was eased when friends and family were available to support men and were understanding of their loss. Furthermore, a positive experience with the healthcare system led to both reduced grief and increased support group participation, whereas insensitive treatment led to psychological distress and worsened grief.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing need for healthcare professionals to provide sensitive and empathetic care to both members of a couple. This includes adopting appropriate, jargon-free language, providing explanations relating to the cause of loss when available, and follow-up calls specifically to men in the weeks or months following a loss. Practical information on how best to support their partner, alongside recognizing and managing their own grief, was also desired by men.</p>
<p>Community attitudes concerning the legitimacy of parents’ grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss, along with gendered expectations relating to how men should behave in the face of loss, were also found to be important in shaping men’s experience. A lack of recognition for grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss resulted in disenfranchisement, with men frequently reporting a feeling of being overlooked as grieving fathers. Policies relating to woman-centered care and bereavement leave in the workplace also impacted grief. Where pregnancy was seen as an issue relating exclusively to women, and men consequently felt excluded from the loss experience at the hospital, their grief was worsened. A small number of studies also suggested that men were frequently not afforded adequate workplace leave to manage their grief following a loss. In line with recent investigations which have highlighted similar social and economic consequences of stillbirth, there is potential to re-examine current paternity and bereavement leave policies.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that individual-level supports should consider the above factors to provide tailored and appropriate support options to suit men’s individual needs. For example, individual counselling or support groups may not be appealing to all men. Rather, previous research has recommended creative options including activity-based supports, evidence-based online supports, opportunity for peer contact, or including male support workers in hospitals. The results also imply that beyond individual and interpersonal supports, there is also a need to educate the community about the impact of pregnancy/neonatal loss on men, as well as promoting their strengths to seek and accept, rather than avoid, support. The authors also suggest that strategies are needed to develop male-inclusive healthcare practices, and promote the meaningful engagement of men as equal partners throughout pregnancy and childbirth. In the broader postnatal health context, engagement of fathers has demonstrated improved long-term physical and mental health outcomes for women, men and babies.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spontaneous embryo resorption in the mouse is triggered by embryonic apoptosis followed by rapid removal via maternal sterile purulent inflammation.</span></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11697" style="width: 597px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11697" height="325" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Fig-BMC-Dev.-Bio-300x166.jpg" width="587" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1: Synopsis of early and late resorptions in relation to normal development</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In normal development of mammals, a high percentage of blastocysts are lost before or after implantation by spontaneous resorption. Spontaneous resorption is a major problem in assisted reproduction in the human. Embryonic transfer (of two blastocysts) in the human results in a pregnancy rate of 30% and a “baby take home rate” of 21%.</p>
<p>Assessment of the occurrence of spontaneous resorption in early stages of pregnancy is challenging, especially in polytocous species. Resorption is very fast, so that with conventional methods only final haemorrhagic stages are encountered. Therefore, up to now it was impossible to foresee and to pick up spontaneous resorptions, which in the majority of cases occur shortly after implantation.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this problem <a href="https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-019-0201-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drews and co-workers in a paper</a> published in <em><a href="https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Developmental Biology</a></em> aimed to identify the mechanism of spontaneous resorption in normal pregnancies. For this purpose, they analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry 23 spontaneous embryo resorptions between days 7 and 13 of murine development. These were identified in a previous study by reduced growth rate and reduced heart rate in daily scans of pregnant mice with high-resolution ultrasound (US).</p>
<p>For histological description, the researchers grouped the specimens into early and late resorptions. The early resorptions were retrieved for histology at day 8 and the late resorptions between days 9 and 11. In the resorptions collected at days 12 and 13 only the placentae were preserved.</p>
<p>It was found that in the early resorptions detected at day 7, the embryo proper was replaced by maternal hemorrhage and a suppurate focus of maternal neutrophils. In the decidua maternal macrophages transformed to foam cells and formed a second focus of tissue dissolution.</p>
<p>In the late spontaneous embryo resorptions, it was found that the embryo undergoes endogenous apoptosis, which proceeds autonomously without maternal interference. During embryonic apoptosis caspase 3 is expressed and embryonic blood cells developed a macrophage like phenotype. Only when the foetal-maternal border breaks down and the innate maternal immune system comes in contact with apoptotic embryonic tissues, the mother mounts a sterile unspecific inflammation and the apoptotic embryo is aborted into the uterine lumen and rapidly resorbed. Failure of lacunar trophoblast and dissolution of the decidua capsularis in the resorptions were clearly discernible from physiological involution of these structures in the normal littermates at days 10 and 11. Rupture of the embryonic vesicle and abortion were accompanied by maternal hemorrhage and massive invasion of maternal neutrophils. The maternal part of the implantation site dissolves by apoptotic liquefaction and transformation of F4/80 positive macrophages into foam cells.</p>
<p>Studies like the above help us increase our understanding about the mechanisms of spontaneous resorption in normal pregnancies and bring us closer in identifying points of intervention to maximize success rates of normal pregnancies and in vitro fertilization.</p>
<h1 style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post-traumatic stress disorder and risk of selected autoimmune diseases among US military personnel.</span></span></strong></h1>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11703 alignleft" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/150917-F-YH552-004-300x211.jpg" width="300" />Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can result from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a serious accident or violent assault. Compared to the general population, military personnel are often exposed to dangerous situations and traumatic events, and therefore are at higher risk for mental disorders.</p>
<p>Individuals with PTSD remain in a perpetual state of hyperarousal and fear. As such, PTSD is associated with endocrine, immune, and neurobiological abnormalities. Posttraumatic stress has been shown to impede functioning of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system. Specifically, lower levels of glucocorticosteroids, elevated proinflammatory factors, altered gene expression, and accelerated aging of immune cells may lead to immune dysfunction that underlies the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, interactions within the neuroendocrine system are bidirectional, meaning that hyperarousal and subsequent increased hormonal activity in the central nervous system can trigger the release of excess levels of stress hormones that further contribute to chronic immune dysregulation and the potential development of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Findings from previous studies indicate that there is an association between PTSD and autoimmune diseases, however, these studies were restricted to veterans after the end of their military service, civilian populations, or to a single gender. Moreover, little is known about the potential role of combat and sexual assault in relation to PTSD and autoimmune disorders. Given the relatively young age at onset for many autoimmune diseases and the high prevalence of PTSD in the military, current military members comprise an important population in which to investigate risk of autoimmune disease in relation to PTSD and better understand the role of specific traumatic events.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-2432-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A study by Rudolph P. Rull and co-workers</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a> prospectively examined the association of PTSD and risk of several relatively common autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study population was 123,761 participants who were serving on active duty when they completed the baseline survey. Data was gathered from the Millennium Cohort Study, a large cohort of US service members. Approximately 71% of the population was male while the baseline prevalence of PTSD was 8% among men and 9% among women. At baseline, both men and women with a history of PTSD were more likely than those without PTSD to be younger, of enlisted rank, in the Army, a current smoker, a heavy or problem drinker, or obese. Those with PTSD were also more likely to have a history of another mental health condition, combat experience, or physical or sexual trauma. Prior combat experience was more common among men, whereas prior physical or sexual trauma was more common among women.</p>
<p>During a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (SD, 3.7 years), 864 participants (55% men, 45% women) were identified with the autoimmune diseases of interest (309 RA, 103 SLE, 151 MS, and 332 IBD). Incidence rates for RA, SLE, and MS were higher for women than for men, whereas rates were similar for IBD. For the composite outcome of any of the selected autoimmune diseases, risk was higher for those with a history of PTSD relative to those with no PTSD in a multivariable model adjusted for demographics and history of another mental health condition. The relative risk for a history of PTSD for each individual autoimmune disease ranged between 1.4 to 2.3 times that of those without a history of PTSD, though estimates were least precise for SLE and MS. Effect estimates stratified by sex did not differ appreciably except for MS and IBD, but estimates were generally imprecise. Further adjustment for BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use did not appreciably change the magnitude of each effect estimate.</p>
<p>To sum up, although estimates for each individual autoimmune disease were generally imprecise, there was an approximately 60% increased risk for the composite outcome of any of the selected autoimmune diseases —RA, SLE, MS, and IBD—for those with a history of PTSD relative to those without a history of PTSD. The magnitude of this association did not materially differ between men and women, though as expected absolute incidence rates were generally higher among women. In addition, findings did not differ according to specific types of prior trauma and healthy behaviors did not appear to influence this association between PTSD and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>The findings from this analysis contribute to an emerging body of evidence that suggests that PTSD may be a risk factor for autoimmune disease. Furthermore, it was observed that the magnitude of this association appears to be similar among those with and without a history of specific traumatic experiences such as combat exposure and physical or sexual trauma. The present study suggests that further research is needed to understand the underlying biological mechanisms which may link PTSD with increased risk of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions, as well as how severity of PTSD may link with increased autoimmune disease risk or severity of illness, and understand whether successful treatment of PTSD may mitigate the risks of these non-neuropsychiatric complications.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“I just keep thinking that I don’t want to rely on people.” a qualitative study of how people living with dementia achieve and maintain independence at home: stakeholder perspectives.</span></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11704" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/dependent-826332_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" />The number of people living with dementia worldwide is set to triple from over 46 million to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia profoundly impacts upon the person living with dementia, their family and carers and wider society. Most people diagnosed with dementia wish to continue living in their own homes as independently as possible, however with progressive functional dependence, this can be difficult.</p>
<p>For people living with dementia, there can be a tension between independence as an expression of autonomy and interdependence enabling people with dementia to remain in their own homes and communities. Qualitative research has explored the ethical dilemmas faced by family carers and professionals in promoting the dignity and autonomy of people living with dementia and deciding how best to adapt the home environment to facilitate independence. However, less is known about how people living with dementia, family carer and professional perspectives differ. This knowledge is important in order to inform the development of psychosocial interventions to enable people with dementia to live well for longer at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1406-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The study by Claudia Cooper and co-workers</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC geriatrics</a></em> is the first qualitative study to explore how people living with dementia, family carers and health and social care professionals understand independence at home for people living with dementia. The researchers conducted an inductive thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 11 people living with dementia, 19 professionals and 22 family carers in England. Participants were recruited in urban, semi-rural and rural areas, were of both genders and of differing ages, ethnicities, nationalities and experiences. Four overlapping themes were identified: Being in a safe familiar environment, enabling not disabling care, maintaining relationships and community connectedness and getting the right support.</p>
<p>Stakeholders agreed that a person-centred approach prioritizing the inherent value of all people with dementia, seeking to uphold rights and promote abilities was important. Professionals often perceived such an approach as being relatively straightforward, while family carers and people living with dementia pointed to a myriad of ethical and practical dilemmas. For family carers these dilemmas often linked to the perceived safety of their relative and the family carer’s sense of personal responsibility. For people with dementia, the act of accepting support was paradoxically both an outward sign of dependence and an enabler of independence. Concepts such as <em>relative interdependence</em>, <em>delegated autonomy</em> and <em>social and spatial independence</em> have previously been applied to understanding independence in older people living in a range of residential settings. These concepts feel especially relevant to the nuanced and complex experiences of people living with dementia and those caring from them and the dynamic nature of interactions and negotiations around independence discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the relational nature of independence at home: the dynamic interaction between the person living with dementia, the family carer and professional support, situated within a resource-limited, wider societal context. Professionals were responding to ‘living well with dementia’ or ‘dementia positive’ agendas, perhaps underestimating the complexity and textured nature of the lived experiences of family carers and people with dementia themselves. Professionals promoted positive risk taking whereas family carers felt they were left holding this risk or persuading relatives to act in a particular way. For people living with dementia the realities of getting into the community and playing an active part were far from straightforward. Psychosocial interventions must accommodate tensions between positive risk-taking and avoiding harm, facilitating autonomy and providing support. They should be adaptive and collaborative, combining self-management with flexible support and consider the emotional burden for family carers of supporting someone to live positively with risk.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential impacts of a novel integrated extracorporeal-CPR workflow using an interventional radiology and immediate whole-body computed tomography system in the emergency department.</span></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11698" style="width: 445px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11698" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Figure-BMC-Cardiovascular-Disorders-300x155.jpg" width="435" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1: The schematic integrated concept of a hybrid emergency room system (HERS) workflow</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can restore blood circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as the cardiopulmonary circuit allows immediate stabilization via effective perfusion and gas exchange. ECPR devices are becoming smaller and cheaper, providing an opportunity to install this rescue therapy in the emergency department (ED). The International Resuscitation Guidelines mentioned ECPR as a potential support to be considered in settings where it can be rapidly implemented, and for selected patients with a suspected etiology of cardiac arrest that is potentially reversible with immediate mechanical cardiorespiratory support. However, there remains insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of ECPR for patients with OHCA.</p>
<p>A novel integrated trauma workflow concept that utilizes a sliding computed tomography (CT) scanner and interventional radiology (IR) system, named a hybrid emergency room system (HERS), allowing emergency therapeutic interventions and CT examination without relocating trauma patients, has recently evolved in Japan. HERS can drastically shorten the ECPR implementation time and more quickly facilitates definitive interventions than the conventional advanced cardiovascular life support workflow.<a href="https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-020-01332-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> In this paper</a> published in <a href="https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em></a>, Satoshi Fujimi and co-workers discuss a novel workflow concept using HERS on ECPR for patients with OHCA that can drastically shorten the ECPR implementation delay and more quickly facilitate definitive interventions than the conventional workflow, without relocating the patients.</p>
<p>The authors previously demonstrated that the HERS is associated with a decreased mortality in patients with severe blunt trauma compared to that with conventional trauma management, even after accounting for potential confounders. Patients treated with the HERS had shorter time intervals from ER arrival to CT examination and emergency surgery compared to those for conventional management. These beneficial observations contributed to the rapid spread of the HERS concept; as of September 2019, eleven tertiary emergency hospitals in Japan and one trauma center in Korea have installed a HERS. This system could be well adapted to ECPR, providing an expedient initiation of mechanical cardiopulmonary support for patients with non-traumatic OHCA. Immediate high-quality CPR, providing effective oxygenation to the vital organs until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, is crucial for optimal outcomes. However, there is no consensus regarding the CPR time interval before ECPR implementation.</p>
<p>Yannopoulos and colleagues previously evaluated a novel protocol with early transport to a cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) for ECPR and revascularization in OHCA patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia. In patients who received the early transport protocol, the average time from the 911 call to CCL arrival was 58 ± 17 min, 28/62 (45%) patients survived to hospital discharge, and 26 (42%) had functionally favorable outcomes. In contrast, only 26/170 (15.3%) patients in a historical routine care group survived to hospital discharge with a favorable outcome. These observations suggest that, in these patients, the early initiation of ECPR to allow for coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would likely be more effective than continuing non-invasive conventional advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) alone.</p>
<p>The schematic concept of HERS integrated workflow the authors propose is described in Fig. 1. The HERS enables ACLS to be followed seamlessly by ECPR induction and post-ECPR procedures, including CAG and PCI, without any patient transfer. The HERS likely shortens the time from the 911 call to ECPR initiation and improves survival in OHCA, as early transport contributes to improved outcomes. In addition, the HERS enables safe head and body CT examinations during the post-ECPR phase, even in hemodynamically unstable patients, while in-hospital transport with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device implantation can cause considerable harm. Thus, given that an extremely time-conscious algorithm should be adopted in the management of, not only severe trauma but also life-threatening critical illnesses mentioned above, the HERS can provide benefits for cardio-cerebral resuscitation in patients with OHCA or severe medical conditions.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>Photo: The serif font Jubilat was used on signs for Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid — though a new study suggests that sans serifs are generally seen as more liberal. Credit: Brett Carlsen/Getty Images.</em></p>
<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Fonts can be very distinctive indeed. Even if robbed of their original context, it can be easy to identify the fonts used on the front of a <em>Harry Potter</em> book, adorning a <em>Star Wars</em> poster, or on the side of a Coca-Cola can, to name a few examples.</p>
<p>But particular fonts can also leave us with other impressions: the font used to brand a beloved book, for example, has different emotional connotations to the one you use to type emails. And according to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10510974.2019.1692884">new research in <em>Communication Studies</em></a> from Katherine Haenschen and Daniel Tamul at Virginia Tech, particular fonts may also carry some political connotations, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-39152"></span></p>
<p>Research on political communication often focuses (quite understandably) on the <em>content</em> of campaign messages — what a candidate is saying and how they’re saying it. There have also been studies looking at the “personality traits” that various fonts can convey. Haenschen and Tamul looked at the intersection of these two topics: how fonts communicate either a liberal or conservative message, regardless of content.</p>
<p>The first study looked at typeface classification — how bold or italic a font is, for example. A total of 987 participants were shown a short, politically neutral piece of writing (“the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”) printed in various fonts: Times New Roman Regular, TNR Bold, TNR Italic, Gill Sans Regular, Gill Sans Bold and Gill Sans Italic. They were then asked to rate how liberal or conservative they felt the font was.</p>
<p>In a second study, a wider variety of typefaces was used. This time, 1,069 participants were either shown the phrase “a large fawn jumped quickly” or the name “Scott Williams” (chosen for its frequency as a name in the US). Three fonts were displayed: a serif font (Jubilat or Times New Roman), a sans serif font (Gills Sans or Century Gothic) and a display font (Sunrise, Birds of Paradise, or Cloister Black Light; these are fonts more commonly used for headings). Jubilat had been used widely in Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in 2016; Century Gothic was picked for its similarity to the font used by Barack Obama in 2008. Again, participants had to rate how liberal or conservative each font was.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_39154" style="width: 759px;"><img alt="names2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39154" data-attachment-id="39154" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="names2" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/names2.png?w=759" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/names2.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/names2.png" data-orig-size="759,223" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/17/heres-how-we-perceive-the-political-leanings-of-different-fonts/names2/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/names2.png?w=845" />Examples of the fonts used in the second experiment. <em>Via <a href="https://osf.io/f65wb/"> Haenschen &amp; Tamul (2019)</a></em></figure>
<p>The results suggested that font styles are seen to have different ideological leanings. Both studies found that sans serifs were likely to be seen as more liberal than serifs, and this was the case both when participants were asked to read a politically neutral phrase and when they read a name. The results for display fonts were mixed: Sunrise was seen as the most liberal whilst Cloister Black Light was considered the most conservative, perhaps because of how modern or traditional they were deemed to be.</p>
<p>The political ideologies of participants themselves also had an impact: both participants with Republican and Democratic leanings tended to rate fonts in a similar way to others with the same ideology. Republicans were also more likely to rate fonts as more conservative overall than independent or Democratic participants. Unsurprisingly, participants also tended to like the fonts that were more aligned with their own ideology.</p>
<p>There are obvious, and immediate, practical implications here. Candidates are clearly trying to present themselves in a particular way; understanding not only what to say in campaign literature but in what font to do so may be a good trick for political teams. Choosing fonts for different purposes could also be a useful strategy for politicians: if one neighbourhood is more liberal than another, then fonts used on leaflets, signs or stickers could be tweaked.</p>
<p>It may also be a useful exercise for those of us not involved in politics to take a step back and look at how political parties or specific messages are being presented to us, and how branding is being used to convey these things. Subtextual details like font may not seem important beyond aesthetics. But look a bit closer, and we may find another message lurking underneath.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have used a combination of machine learning and neuroimaging to figure out which people will respond to an antidepressant drug</strong>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2232792-brain-activity-can-help-predict-wholl-benefit-from-an-antidepressant/">reports Jason Arunn Murugesu</a> at <em>New Scientist</em>. The team took EEG recordings from more than 200 people with depression, and then gave them the drug sertraline. Eight weeks later, they used a machine learning algorithm to analyse the recordings and look for signals that were more common in those who had responded to the drug. When the researchers then used the algorithm to predict whether a separate group of people would respond to sertraline based just on their brain waves, it performed pretty well <strong>—</strong> but researchers say it’s still a long way from any potential clinical use.</p>

<p><strong>Using marijuana can make people more susceptible to false memories</strong>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/vape-study-reveals-link-marijuana-false-memories">Sarah Sloat at <em>Inverse </em>reports</a>. Stoned participants were more likely to “remember” words in a memory test that they hadn’t actually previously seen, and were more susceptible to the creation of false memories for an event they had witnessed. The findings have obvious implications for eyewitness memory for crimes.</p>

<p><strong>An extinct, 80kg rodent had a brain that may have weighed just 47g</strong>. Based on the volume of the cavity in a <em>Neoepiblema acreensis </em>skull, researchers calculated that the creature’s brain must have been absolutely tiny, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/science/rodent-brain-fossil.html">according to Veronique Greenwood</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>. The team suggests that the <em>N. acreensis</em> may have evolved a small brain because it lived in relative peace, with few aggressive predators. With little need to outsmart hungry hunters, a smaller brain would have been adaptive, as it requires fewer calories to maintain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/618345666/0/oupblogpsychology/">How dating apps reflect our changing times</a></h4>

<p>As we look forward to explore what’s next in love and sex, it makes sense to examine to the heart. That which lovers have once worn on their sleeve is now being navigated in the palm of our hands. With mobile devices and apps letting us literally explore desires with our fingertips, as social scientists we are in a new frontier in which to examine who we pursue for love, and why. Is this the end of romance, or the beginning of a new way to love and connect to one another?</p><p>With over <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.toptal.com/finance/business-model-consultants/online-dating-industry">1,500 dating apps on the market</a>, many have come to the conclusion that the romance of courtship has been replaced with fantasy and heavily-edited Instagram photos.  Along with driving this increase in dating apps, the millennial generation is also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/well/mind/millennials-love-marriage-sex-relationships-dating.html">delaying marriage</a> and moving away from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/millennials-are-leaving-religion-and-not-coming-back/">conventional religious practices</a>. Because of this, many popular magazines and TV shows suggest that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookup_culture">hook-up culture</a> dominates contemporary pursuits of love. Right-swiping, label free, highly educated, and technologically savvy, today’s young people appear to pursue sex frequently and do so on their own terms. There also appears to be much more equal footing between genders than ever before.</p><p>Anyone can download a dating app and begin swiping left or right within minutes, it does not seem to mean that more people are having sex. In fact, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160802125209.htm">15% of 20 to 24 year olds born in the 90s reported no recent sexual partners compared to 6% of Gen Xers</a> (when they were the same age). This is likely more about our current cultural climate and less of a generational difference.  Recently researchers found out that across all generations, reported frequency of sex appears to be <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/">falling</a> compared to even two years ago. Even the <em>Washington Post </em>recently suggested Americans are having a sexual <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/">dry spell</a>, opaquely insinuating that desire has been replaced with student loan debt and existential peril.</p><p>Economic anxieties aside, we have to wonder: If connecting to one another is easier than ever, why are we more likely than ever to keep our hands to ourselves?</p><p>It may be that the dry spell is not a dry spell at all, but a sexual recalibration. Some scientists suggest that less sex doesn’t reflect relationship satisfaction or <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencealert.com/no-having-more-sex-will-not-make-you-happier-study-reveals">overall happiness</a>. In fact, less sex could mean that people having healthier “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/americans_are_having_less_sex_but_is_that_a_problem">sex diets</a><u>,</u>” partly driven by people’s increased ability to apply selective criteria to potential romantic partners.</p><p>Accelerating this growing desire for romantic discernment may be the advent of new and specialized dating apps. Instead of relying on a friend’s opinion on a potential romantic partner after a few drinks at the bar, you can now enlist your friends through the app <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wingmanapp.com/">Wingman</a> <em>to</em> peruse potential romantic partners for you and select what they think is your best match. This makes us more selective about who we ultimately meet in real life, decreasing the need to go to out and nervously introduce yourself to a potential suitor sitting across the room.</p><p>However, this increased discernment means that <em>some</em> people aren’t having much sex, but other people are having <em>most </em>of the sex, especially heterosexual individuals. A recent study analyzing swipes and likes on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://tinder.com/">Tinder</a> showed that the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/">top 20% of men, in terms of attractiveness, were pursued by the top 78% of women.</a> What this suggests is that the online dating market is heavily unequal in terms of who is most likely to receive attention from the opposite sex. It is not surprising then to see the decline in sex in the overall population is being <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/">led by a particular proportion of young men</a>. Even the dating market experiences its own versions of economic inequality.</p><p>But these statistics aren’t meant to dissuade a longing lover from trying his or her hand at meeting a potential romantic partner. In fact, technology may be providing new tools for connection that have never existed before. A new site called <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">D</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">ating-</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">B</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">ots</a> allows programmers to upload specially trained bots for the public to use that can be deployed on a number of different dating sites. These bots then chat with potential suitors using dialogue that has been statistically tested to garner the most replies or phone numbers. These bots promise to “take your love life to the next level” while “teaching you how to flirt” and “helping you select the best match.”</p><p>Ultimately, dating apps are developing based on our prurient interests in finding the best possible mate for our current market value in the dating market. Some apps help to give people the best chances for achieving that, while others may make it easier for those with the most desirable qualities to be selected at higher rates than ever before. However, like most markets, in time there will be more parity as new tools emerge for connecting different types of romantic partners.</p><p>What this all means for researchers is that to understand sexual behaviors, we must look at the economy, culture, and technological changes together to understand changes in overall averages of sex rates and habits. While online dating is most likely not the cause of a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating">Dating Apocalypse</a>,<em> </em>it is likely a telling window into the hearts, minds, and libidos of our ever-evolving American culture.</p><p><em>Featured image by Rob Hampson via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/cqFKhqv6Ong">unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-dating-apps-reflect-our-changing-times/">How dating apps reflect our changing times</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/618345666/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/618345666/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/618345666/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/seven-psychology-books-that-explore-why-we-are-who-we-are-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">Seven psychology books that explore why we are who we are [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/" rel="nofollow">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/using-math-to-understand-inequity/" rel="nofollow">Using math to understand inequity</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Memes have become an integral part of online communication — and a <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/what-does-it-all-meme">ripe area for research</a>. Underlying the simplicity of a grainy picture and a few words of text are countless more complex psychological questions. What determines why some memes go viral? How do they shape people’s political or social views? And in what ways do our perceptions of memes change depending on our personalities — or even on our mental health?</p>
<p>To this latter question, at least, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57953-4">a new study in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> has some answers. Researchers have found that depressed people seem to enjoy memes with depression-related themes more than non-depressed individuals — a finding that points at differences in how people with mental health difficulties use humour as a coping mechanism.</p>
<p><span id="more-39124"></span></p>
<p>Past work had found that “positive” humour  (such as jokes designed to make us feel connected or have a good-natured laugh at the funny side of life) is better than “negative” humour (like aggressive teasing or making yourself the butt of a joke) at helping people deal with negative emotions and improve their well-being. But this research had mainly focussed on the general population: it wasn’t clear whether people with depression respond to different kinds of humour in the same way.</p>
<p>To investigate this possibility, Umair Akram at Sheffield Hallam University and colleagues looked at how people with and without depression responded to memes that used negative humour. First, the researchers compiled a set of “depressive” memes, which contained content related to the experience of depression, such as hopelessness or isolation. They also put together a set of neutral memes that were simply “generally humorous social commentaries” without negative content.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_39128" style="width: 783px;"><img alt="memes" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39128" data-attachment-id="39128" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="memes" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/memes.png?w=783" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/memes.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/memes.png" data-orig-size="783,358" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/14/people-with-depression-may-find-sad-memes-funnier-and-more-uplifting/memes/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/memes.png?w=845" />Example of a “depressive” meme (left) and a neutral meme (right). <em>Via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57953-4"> Akram et al (2020)</a></em></figure>
<p>The team then asked 154 UK participants to view and rate each meme on various dimensions, including how positive, funny, relatable, and shareable they found it, as well as the extent to which they thought it would make someone with depression feel good. The participants also completed a standard measure of depressive symptoms, as well as a scale that assessed their ability to regulate their own emotions.</p>
<p>For their analysis, the team compared the 56 participants who showed no signs of depression and the 43 who met the criteria for moderately severe or severe depression. These two groups judged the depressive memes as equally negative, but they differed in their other perceptions: those who were depressed found the memes more humorous, relatable and sharable than the non-depressed group. They were also more likely to think that the memes would improve the mood of someone with depression. However, the groups didn’t differ on their assessments of the neutral memes.</p>
<p>While past research has highlighted the benefit of positive humour in helping people cope with emotional distress, the authors say that their findings suggest a negative style of humour may be particularly helpful for people experiencing depression. Although that might be counter-intuitive given how defeatist or pessimistic the memes appear, the team says that depressed individuals might actually get something positive out of them. “Memes visualise the experience and encumbering nature of depressive symptoms, which for many may be difficult to verbalise,” they write. “Therefore, by sharing and observing depressive memes, depressed individuals may theoretically form social and emotional bonds with others which may be perceived as socially supportive.”</p>
<p>The researchers also found statistical evidence that depressed participants had difficulties using emotion regulation strategies (e.g. re-appraising a negative experience in a more positive way), and that these difficulties were a key factor in explaining why they enjoyed depressive memes more. So participants may have also been using the memes to deal with or make light of their experiences, to make up for their lack of other regulation strategies.</p>
<p>More research is obviously needed to explore these effects — it’s unclear whether the depressive memes actually improved people’s mood, for instance, or whether participants just <em>thought</em> they would. But the results do have interesting parallels with another finding we wrote about last year: that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/">people with depression like listening to sad music</a> more than others.  That study found that depressed people find sad music soothing or calming, and report feeling more happiness and less sadness after listening to sad music clips. So it seems that, when it comes to music or humour at least, what we find “positive” is a matter of personal experience and interpretation.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/loneliness-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Most individuals experience loneliness at some point in their lifetime but many will not admit to this experience due to the stigma surrounding it. Often, the terms ‘loneliness’ and ‘social isolation’ are used interchangeably even though there are some differences. For example, loneliness is viewed as a subjective experience that tends to occur when an individual has limited companionship and little or no emotional and social support. Social isolation, on the other hand, is considered to occur when there is lack of social contact and interaction with family, friends or the wider community. Hence, it is possible for an individual to have a large number of social connections and still feel lonely, or to be isolated but not experience loneliness.</p>
<p>Loneliness may occur at any point in a life cycle, e.g. during childhood, adolescence, middle-age or older age; and risk factors that can cause loneliness and social isolation include: age, gender, home relocation, geographic isolation, living alone, divorce, widowhood, poor health, limited mobility, ethnicity, and retirement. However, older people appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing loneliness and social isolation. According to Age UK (2018), there are 1.4 million chronically lonely older people in England and many more across the UK. Loneliness is widely publicized as a major health concern due to its negative impact on health.</p>
<p>Research has identified links between loneliness/social isolation and a higher risk for a variety of mental and physical health conditions including heart disease, high blood pressure, weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and even death. Interventions aimed at alleviating loneliness and social isolation are now advocated widely as solutions to this growing problem, although the extent to which these interventions are evidence-informed is unclear. Hence, we conducted a scoping review to map the large body of research evidence in this area and to describe the range of loneliness/social isolation interventions targeted at older populations.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11671 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/lonely-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8251-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our review</a> (of reviews) identified that review authors do not always provide a rationale or theoretical underpinning for the interventions studied, and that generally the intervention and its match with loneliness is poorly conceptualized and defined. Interventions reported to be effective appeared to be characterized by, among other aspects, a theoretical underpinning. Moreover, our review points to the importance of context and highlights that a lack of theoretical underpinning tends to pose difficulties in terms of ascertaining which context(s) a particular category of intervention would be most appropriate or effective, and also by which mechanisms these interventions work to reduce loneliness and social isolation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a broad range of terms were used to describe the characteristics of interventions that were designed to alleviate loneliness and social isolation. Although the same or similar terms were used, often, their meanings were different. Improving the consistency of terminology that is used to describe these interventions is likely to increase accuracy and improve the reporting of an intervention as well as aid in the process of replicating interventions across different contexts.</p>
<p>Our research also points to the importance of recognizing the uniqueness of the individual experience of loneliness among older people who may not experience loneliness and social isolation in the same way or to the same degree. Given the subjective experience of loneliness, and the varying determinants of loneliness and social isolation, it is also important to target interventions at the respective causes of loneliness and social isolation. Hence, there is a need to tailor interventions to meet the requirements of each individual whilst taking account of the diversity and heterogeneity across interventions in terms of goals, design and implementation.</p>
<p>Distinguishing clearly between interventions targeted at reducing loneliness and social isolation is important as those interventions targeted at alleviating loneliness might not work for individuals who feel socially isolated and vice versa. Finally, service planners and providers should match effective interventions to their service context and goals, and also match individuals to interventions based on their assessed needs.</p>

<p>How do you measure the success of a child’s education? Test results are one thing, and according to a recent global survey, British children have risen in the league tables for both maths and reading. However, these same teens reported among the lowest levels of life satisfaction. They may be performing well academically, but they’re not thriving.</p>
<p>This isn’t a problem only in the UK, of course. At a recent conference that I attended, organised by the <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org">Templeton World Charity Foundation</a>, research psychologists, education specialists, economists and philosophers from around the world met to discuss how to help individuals and societies flourish in the 21st century. One word hung in the air as key: “character”.</p>
<p><span id="more-39112"></span></p>
<h3>Beyond grit</h3>
<p>The meaning of the word “character” tends to be interpreted a little differently around the world. In some countries, the focus has been on character virtues that contribute directly to academic success. However, some educators argue that <a href="https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/userfiles/jubileecentre/pdf/insight-series/WeeAndDeLaMotte_ReshapingMentalHealthThroughTheVirtues.pdf">other virtues are very important for a child’s mental health</a>, and for the well-being of society. “Popular books on character education in the US have tended to focus on what might be called ‘performance virtues’, such as grit and resilience,” notes Tom Harrison, director of the <a href="https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk">Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues</a> at the University of Birmingham. However, “these qualities are essentially amoral – they can be used for good or bad ends”.</p>
<p>We also need to teach young people about moral, civic and intellectual virtues, he argues. Moral virtues include courage (acting with bravery in fearful situations), justice (acting with fairness towards others by honouring rights and responsibilities), and honesty (being truthful and sincere). Psychological research of course supports the idea that many of these virtues, such as <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-20/edition-1/gratitude-parent-all-virtues">gratitude</a>, are good for an individual’s own mental health, never mind the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/18/underestimating-the-power-of-gratitude-recipients-of-thank-you-letters-are-more-touched-than-we-expect/">people around them</a> (see Amit Kumar and Nicholas Epley’s research on gratitude letters). <a href="https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/media/news/article/6641/Statement-of-Civic-Virtues-in-the-Public-Domain">“Civic” virtues</a>, meanwhile, include the concepts of service and citizenship, while “intellectual” virtues  involve notions such as curiosity.</p>
<p>The idea that it’s beneficial to teach a range of virtues, either explicitly or more subtly through entertainment, is of course an ancient one. As Shannon Vallor, a philosopher at the University of Edinburgh’s Futures Institute, told the Templeton conference, theatre, music, philosophy, religion (as well as storytelling, of course) have all functioned, and can still function, to reinforce moral and civic virtues within a society.</p>
<p>But today, character education can benefit from research in psychology and new work in moral philosophy, Harrison argues. The aim is to cultivate Aristotle’s concept of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/24/a-new-trial-of-an-ancient-rhetorical-trick-finds-it-can-make-you-wiser/">practical wisdom</a> in children; to help them to make the “right” choices in all kinds of scenarios. (See also Igor Grossman’s research on the “Illeist Diary Method” of training for wisdom).</p>
<h3>Bringing character into the classroom</h3>
<p>Harrison and his colleagues aren’t alone in that belief. There’s an increasing realisation, at the government level, that our schools have become too narrowly focused on academic achievement. Partly to that end, this academic year, the Ofsted inspection framework for schools included <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/character-education-framework">character education</a> for the first time. This applies to all primary and secondary schools. It’s no longer possible for a school to get a “good” or an “outstanding” rating unless it can demonstrate that it is doing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/userfiles/jubileecentre/pdf/TeachingCharacterThroughtheCurriculum.pdf">In the UK</a>, it’s suggested that teachers do teach the virtues explicitly – to explain what they are – and give children scenarios that illustrate them. The school and the teachers are also expected to model these virtues, by prioritising humility, respect and integrity, for example, and perhaps developing projects to help the local community, to demonstrate good citizenship.</p>
<p>It’s not a small ask. But, Harrison maintains: “We think that character is mainly caught rather than taught. This means that it is more about how schools prioritise key virtues in their everyday work. It’s about how they establish the ethos and culture of a school to ensure children understand why character virtues are important for their own and others’ flourishing. Also, we think that rather than character education being another thing on the teacher’s plate it can be the plate itself – as it contributes to furthering whole school priorities such as behaviour, attainment, employability and citizenship.”</p>
<h3>What will success look like?</h3>
<p>With the teaching of performance-related virtues, it’s very easy to measure success: after an intervention, either the kids get better results, or they don’t. But how do you assess the teaching of all these other virtues?</p>
<p>Character and the impact of a character education intervention is very difficult to measure accurately, Harrison concedes. <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/C">A few trials have been run</a>, but they had flaws, and were very expensive, he says. The Jubilee Centre (whose character education framework is used in the UK and internationally) recommends instead <a href="https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/1721/character-education/teacher-resources/evaluation-handbook-for-schools">an approach of self-evaluation</a>, in which teachers reflect on the changes they feel are taking place as a result of character education.</p>
<p>Around the world, other groups are developing their own programmes for children. In Sri Lanka, for example, where there are high levels of religious tension, interpersonal violence and also suicide, Shehan Williams, a local professor of psychiatry, has developed a web-based character education project. Aimed at 12- to 14-year-olds, it presents the children with a series of scenarios and questions. Some are designed simply to encourage the child to recognise commonalities with children of other religions, in the hope that this will build the virtue of tolerance. This project should get under way later this year. When it comes to teaching these virtues, and assessing the impact of the project, neither will be easy, Williams agrees. “But it’s worth trying,” he says.</p>
<p>Along with philosophers and educators, some leaders have recognised the dangers of too narrow a focus on individual performance and achievement, at the expense of teaching moral virtues. The US President Theodore Roosevelt famously said, “To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society”. And you don’t have to look hard to find examples of hugely “successful” menaces to society – smart, “well-educated” people doing morally despicable things.</p>
<p>In 2014, academics at Oxford University started to really think about this. They began to question not whether the university produces thinkers and leaders – which it certainly does – but whether it produces good leaders and wise thinkers. “For example,” as Edward Brooks, a philosopher and theologian, told the Templeton conference, “at Oxford, you might develop resilience, but you are unlikely to explicitly learn humility…” From this self-examination, the Oxford Character Project, which Brooks directs, was born.</p>
<h3>Worth trying</h3>
<p>Last year, Brooks (along with Jonathan Brant and Michael Lamb) <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s40889-019-00075-x?author_access_token=G7JEsboe62nWd17_RE-GwPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY40KES8D49oITITJIIyTOkOq6uvmGs771sgUgFMo82r8t1XBE0F1NSFtzv6C-GBCFYtgLKqbNedCAd15J--6OKxLRBtXtETWfSK9bWy4no9iw==">published an analysis</a> of the impacts of three years of one of its initiatives in the <em>International Journal of Ethics Education</em>. An extra-curricular seven-month programme for graduate students, the Oxford Global Leadership initiative is designed to help the students develop the ethical qualities of character needed to be a good leader. It includes sessions on the nature of good leadership, on service, humility and gratitude, for example, and it encourages students to focus on the qualities of character that leaders need to promote the common good. Quantitative as well as qualitative evaluations suggest that the initiative is working to develop awareness of, and adherence to, these virtues. These students “have great desire to do good and effect change in the world”, Brooks reported.</p>
<p>The bigger question of whether these people will go on to be morally virtuous leaders, and tilt the balance of global leadership in that direction, will take longer to answer. Perhaps these students are now “better” people than they were before. But they signed up for the initiative. They probably weren’t that unprincipled to start off with. Moderating the future leaders who would otherwise become corrupt and malign surely has to start in childhood, in homes as well as schools.</p>
<p>Certainly, I have witnessed the benefits of strong school-based character education for my own two sons and their classmates. They go to a primary school with a strong Christian ethos. My husband and I are atheists. We had reservations about sending them there. But an emphasis on moral and civic virtues permeates the school culture, more than reinforcing whatever we try to teach them about at home. Whenever I hear my sons talking about sharing what we have, about kindness, or about recognising how fortunate we are, I’m filled with a sense of gratitude. Of course, these virtues don’t have to be taught in a religious context. But they should be taught. As Shehan Williams said, though it might not be easy to get a character education programme established, or to assess an intervention, it is surely worth trying.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Na Helian will talk about the paper "Dynamic Hierarchical Structure for Cloud Computing Job Scheduling Utilizing Artificial Intelligence Technologies".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cloud computing is widely used due to its cost effectiveness and starvation
free execution of processes. There has been substantial research done
in job scheduling algorithm in cloud computing to improve scheduling
performance, but little attention has been paid to structure design for
job scheduling. This paper aims to improve job scheduling makespan (max
processing time for given jobs) in a cloud environment. A dynamic
hierarchical structure, which introduces sub-schedulers between scheduler
and servers, is proposed to dynamically change the connection pattern
between sub-schedulers and servers by using artificial intelligence search
algorithms. Due to its dynamic and flexible nature, this design enables
the system to adaptively accommodate the heterogeneity of jobs and resources
in order to make most use of the resources available. Experimental results
demonstrate that a dynamic hierarchical structure can significantly reduce
the total makespan of the heterogeneous tasks allocated to heterogeneous
resources, compared with a one-layer structure. This reduction is
particularly pronounced when resources are scarce.</p>

<p>If you follow mainstream science coverage, you have likely heard by now that many scientists believe that the differences between liberals and conservatives aren’t just ideological, but biological or neurological. That is, these differences are driven by deeply-seated features of our bodies and minds which exist prior to any sort of conscious evaluation of a given issue.</p>
<p>Lately, though, follow-up research has been poking some holes in this general theory. In November, for example, Emma Young <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/27/no-conservatives-dont-experience-feelings-of-disgust-any-more-than-liberals/">wrote</a> about <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167219880191">findings</a> which undermined past suggestions that conservatives are more readily disgusted than liberals. More broadly, <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/how-social-science-might-be-misunderstanding-conservatives.html">as I wrote in 2018</a>, there’s a burgeoning movement in social and political psychology to re-evaluate some of the strongest claims about liberal-conservative personality differences, with at least some evidence to suggest that the nature and magnitude of these differences has been overblown by shoddy or biased research.</p>
<p>Now, a new study set to appear in the <em>Journal of Politics</em> and available in preprint <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/49hfg">here</a> suggests that another key claim about liberal-conservative differences may be less sturdy than it appears.</p>
<p><span id="more-39105"></span></p>
<p>Many researchers have argued that people are more likely to endorse conservatism if they want to reduce feelings of threat in their lives, note the authors, led by Mathias Osmundsen at Aarhus University. “In this view, so-called ‘threat-sensitive’ individuals find the order inherent in a conservative ideology attractive,” they write.</p>
<p>Political scientists’ favored method of measuring threat-sensitivity in recent years has been so-called psychophysiological studies, which gauge how the body responds to what is going on in the mind. The key studies here measure participants’ skin conductance (also known as electrodermal activity, or EDA), using electrodes attached to the fingertips. This provides an index of automatic bodily arousal. A big turning point came in 2008, when <a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=poliscifacpub">Douglas Oxley and his colleagues</a> found that conservatives had higher EDA than liberals when viewing threatening images, including pictures of spiders, maggots and guns, and several studies with similar findings have since been published.</p>
<p>For this new study, Osmundsen and colleagues sought to investigate the reliability of these results. The paper is a three-part effort consisting of a replication attempt, with a much larger sample size, on a group of Danes and Americans; a re-analysis of all the previously published studies on this subject with an eye toward ascertaining their quality; and a more zoomed-out evaluation of the instruments being used by researchers to do this sort of work.</p>
<p>What the team found suggests a field very much in need of some refinement. Some of the issues here are rather fundamental: For example, they write, “EDA is influenced by a range of factors that are likely to vary randomly and arbitrarily across individuals … includ[ing] outside noises, deep breaths, coughs, room temperature, bodily movements, thickness of the skin of the fingertips, pre-experiment arousal (e.g., from having biked to the lab) and so forth.” Researchers are simply assuming that measures of EDA are (more or less) good proxies for fear responses, ignoring a host of other factors that potentially introduce a great deal of noise. Because the extant literature so rarely indicates that these factors have been taken into account, the team writes, “we simply do not know if measures of EDA in political science research are empirically reliable.”</p>
<p>The literature fails to answer other important questions as well, argue the authors, like whether EDA responses to positive imagery mirror those to scary imagery, which would suggest it isn’t really fear being measured, at root, but arousal more generally. Indeed, a more recent theory has argued that conservatives may be more easily aroused than liberals, rather than more attuned to threat specifically.</p>
<p>The replication study was also an attempt to shed light on some of these questions by evaluating the reliability of the EDA measurement procedure itself, simply by comparing and correlating the participants’ EDA responses to various positive and negative stimuli.</p>
<p>The researchers found that their EDA measures were “very unreliable.” For example, there was almost no internal consistency when it came to responses to threatening (or to disgusting) stimuli, suggesting that whatever EDA is measuring, it isn’t a threat response. But the data were consistent with the idea that the EDA tests were measuring “individual differences in baseline physiological reactivity.” And although the researchers were able to replicate the correlation between conservatism and heightened EDA responses to negative stimuli in their American sample, there was no such correlation among Danish participants. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0823-z">Another study out this week</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> failed to replicate the correlation among Dutch <em>or </em>American participants). This suggests that the original finding may not be generalizable to the wider population.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when the researchers simply asked the participants to gauge their explicit response to the imagery, they found sturdier correlations. “In contrast to physiological responses to threat, self-reported reactions to the threatening images were associated in both Denmark and the United States with more conservative beliefs, but only significantly so for the two measures that arguably reflect social [rather than fiscal] conservatism[.]”</p>
<p>So where does all this leave us? It appears that the tools used to measure fear-sensitivity in many previous studies might not be measuring that at all. This, of course, does not mean that there are no <em>arousal</em>-based differences between liberals and conservatives; it could be there are some good-sized and robust ones, for all we know. But the mixed results of the replication attempt suggest that even this weaker claim is far from certain. They also suggest that, while measures of automatic (or implicit) responses are very ‘in’ right now, they aren’t necessarily a better or more meaningful tool than simply asking people how they feel.</p>

<p><em>Note: This post was written by Vitalba Crivello, Policy Analyst, European Science Media Hub.</em></p>
<p>In an era of alternative facts and misinformation, the loss of public trust is not only a challenge for scientists, experts and the media, but also for policymakers and for society as a whole. Scientists often blame the media for incorrect reporting, while the media are critical of scientists’ ability to engage with the public. Citizens may feel confused by news headlines about scientific studies which can sometimes come to different, if not contradictory, conclusions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">European Science-Media Hub (ESMH)</a> was launched in June 2018 to help address these issues. The ESMH, operating under the political responsibility of the European Parliament’s Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA), acts as <strong>a centre for information, networking, education and training in science journalism</strong>. It is a platform promoting knowledge sharing between the European Parliament, the scientific community and the media.</p>
<p>Eighteen intense months have elapsed since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2018/06/28/the-european-science-media-hub-kick-off-event-communicating-science-via-social-media-june-27-2018/">initial meeting</a>, attended by PLOS among other members of the scientific community, European research organisations and journalists.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">ESMH website</a> was launched a year ago, 29<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-articles/"><strong> journalistic articles</strong></a> have been published, written in collaboration with journalists and scientists on topics including AI, new technologies, disinformation, communication and social sciences. Each article is accompanied by <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/interview/"><strong>interviews with experts</strong></a> (40 to date) and highlights related to <strong>EU-funded projects</strong>. <strong>Articles appear every second Wednesday, alternating with the </strong><a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/press-review/"><strong>ESMH Press Review “Two weeks of science”</strong></a> (22 issues to date) prepared by the ESMH team by tracking trending topics in the media.</p>
<p><strong>ESMH 2019 Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepared a series of <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/videos/"><strong>7 thematic videos</strong></a>, touching upon scientific topics of particular interest, dealt with by STOA during the 8th parliamentary term.</li>
<li>Organised <strong>thematic workshops for journalists</strong>, including ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/02/21/esmh-workshop-tackling-disinformation-and-misinformation-in-science/"><strong>Tackling dis/misinformation in Science</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised a workshop for the general public entitled ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/04/18/esmh-workshop-virality-and-influencers-in-digital-communication-april-3-2019/"><strong>Virality and influencers in digital communication</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/tag/eysmd2019/"><strong>the first edition of the European Youth Science-Media Days (EYSMD) – the ESMH summer school for young journalists “AI and journalism”</strong></a>. This was the first event of its kind, providing the 80 attendees with an overview of existing links between artificial intelligence (AI) and journalism.</li>
<li>More than 350 journalists, science communicators, and representatives of research organisations and EU institutions now regularly receive ESMH updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What’s on the radar for the Hub in 2020?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To strengthen networks, the ESMH is currently working in cooperation with the European Parliament Liaison Offices to organise a series of Science-Media events in some EU Member States, in the framework of the <strong>ESMH project on ‘Engagement of science journalists/communicators in ESMH activities’ </strong>(launched in 2019). The events have the dual purpose of raising awareness about the ESMH platform and exploring the different needs of media stakeholders in order to better adapt the ESMH offer for these communicators.</li>
<li>We are also enlarging our community of science writers via a devoted <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-call-for-expression-of-interest/">Call for Expression of Interest</a>.</li>
<li>We are upgrading our media intelligence technology to produce a richer version of the ESMH press review.</li>
<li>In May, we plan a series of website articles focused on the environment, in view of the second edition of the <strong>ESMH summer school, </strong>already under preparation<strong>. </strong>The event, entitled<strong> ‘Digital technologies for environmental sustainability’,</strong> will take place in Strasbourg in coordination with the broader <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/european-youth-event/en/eye2020/home.html">European Youth Event (EYE)</a>.</li>
<li>In June, another event in the pipeline for this summer is the ‘<strong>Science Week at the European Parliament</strong>’, which will be organised by STOA in Brussels and will be co-ordinated with the Directorate-General Research and Innovation of the European Commission, the European Research Council (ERC) and, possibly, the Joint Research Centre. The ESMH plans to replicate the experience of 2019 by organising a thematic workshop for journalists and a pitching session between journalists and researchers.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the ESMH is planning to hold sessions at two major international conferences: the International Journalism Festival (IJF) in Perugia (April 2020) and the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Trieste (July 2020).</li>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">If you confidently tell a young child a fact, they’re likely to believe you. But you’d better be right — because if they find out that you were wrong, and should have known better, they’ll doubt not only your credibility but your intelligence too. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">These are the implications of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227026"><span class="Hyperlink0"><span style="color: black;">new work</span></span></a> in <em>PLOS One</em><span class="None">, led by Susan Birch at the University of British Columbia. It shows that children prefer to learn from people who are consistently confident, rather than hesitant, about what they say. However, even kids as young as four also keep a track record of a person’s accuracy, and make judgements about them on this basis. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“We now know that children are even more savvy at learning from others than we previously thought,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/uobc-urr012420.php">says Birch</a>. “They don’t just prefer to learn from anyone who is confident; they avoid learning from people who have confidently given wrong information in the past.” </span></span><span id="more-39101"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The vast majority of the information that we learn in life comes from other people, note Birch and her colleagues. But as we all differ in intelligence and areas of expertise — and often offer opinions rather than facts — to learn best, children would benefit from working out whom to trust. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Obvious confidence in a statement can certainly be a cue to its credibility. This might be expressed verbally (by introducing a statement with “I know…” rather than “I think…”, for example) and also in body language (nodding versus shrugging, for instance) and gestures. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">However, confidence is not always a reliable guide to accuracy. (And to be clear, we’re talking about apparent confidence in a given statement, rather than confidence as a more general aspect of personality.) To optimise learning, we really need to identify people who are confident when it’s justified, and also hesitant when it’s justified — because they don’t really know the answer. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">To explore how this skill might develop, Birch and her colleagues ran three studies on 662 children. They used videos of actors </span></span><span lang="EN-US">showing “justified” confidence or hesitancy or “unjustified” confidence or hesitancy, and gauged the children’s opinions of these individuals. In each case, an actor was either allowed or not allowed to look inside a box, which contained pictures that the child could not see. The video showed them then being asked what was in the box, and their responses. For example, the “informed, justifiably confident” actor nodded and immediately said something like, “It’s a rabbit. I know it’s a rabbit. It’s a rabbit for sure.” The “informed, unjustifiably hesitant” actor, who had been allowed to look, shrugged and said, “Umm, it could be a puppy… hmm… maybe a puppy? I’ll guess a puppy.” The researchers then probed which of the actors the children would prefer to learn new words from, and who they thought was smarter. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">An initial study of children aged 3 to 12 found that from around the age of five, all preferred to learn from the justifiably confident individuals, and judged them as being smarter. <span class="None">To explore this further, the team then ran two follow-up studies on children aged 4 to 8. They used the same experimental design, but the first of the follow-ups directly compared responses to justified versus unjustified confidence, while the second looked only at justified and unjustified hesitancy.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The results were clear. From the age of four, all of the children placed more trust in the justifiably vs unjustifiably confident individuals. However, even the eight-year-olds failed to realise that someone who showed justified hesitancy (because they hadn’t been allowed to see inside the box) was more reliable than someone whose hesitancy was not justified (because they had indeed seen inside it). It seems, then, that sensitivity to this key clue to credibility takes much longer to develop. This delay might happen because a child’s brain is more wired to attend to clues than to misinformation, the researchers suggest. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“Taken together this set of experiments provides a more comprehensive demonstration of children’s complex and nuanced understanding of the mind while simultaneously illuminating specific limitations in their social cognitive understanding,” they write. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the real world, of course, children are rarely given the opportunity to make such immediate clear-cut judgements about an adult’s credibility, and few of us are always reliable, or always unreliable. But this work does suggest that if you don’t want even a young child to judge you harshly (and anyone who has kids knows that they can be pretty unforgiving judges), you should be clear about when you really know something for a fact — and when you don’t.</span></span></p>

<h2><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-5727 size-large" height="682" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pexels-photo-396133-1024x682.jpeg" width="1024" /></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Motherhood changes everything</h2>
<p>Little did I know before I had my boys how completely and utterly being their mother would change EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Having children threw the pieces of my life up in the air. The pieces settled again, but my body, outlook on life, sense of self and emotions have never been quite the same. Not only did I birth two beautiful boys into the world, I birthed a new identity.</p>
<p>Yes, I realise it is the ultimate cliché, but motherhood changes everything. It recalibrates our life course and realigns our lives.</p>
<p>My experience is not unique. Motherhood is one of the most fundamental transformations we go through as women. And for many of us, parenthood brings with it powerful identity changes and conflicting emotions: love, protectiveness, joy, nurturing, exhaustion, confusion, anger and apathy.</p>
<h2>A cocktail of pregnancy hormones prepares your body and brain</h2>
<p>During pregnancy, a cocktail of hormones prepares your body for birth and breastfeeding. You grow an entirely new organ, the placenta, to ensure your baby receives nutrients and to buffer her against stress. Your metabolism resets to store energy for foetal development and lactation. Your breasts grow so you can nurse.</p>
<p>Once your baby arrives, she’s often so irresistible you become consumed by her and spend much of your time caressing, holding, feeding, gazing at her and breathing in her scent. These maternal behaviours, as they’re called, are essential for the survival of your newborn.</p>
<p>The same cocktail profoundly alters the architecture of your expectant brain, in particular, the brain structures underlying social cognition and emotion. These brain changes last, and in both humans and non-human mammals, the differences in the brains and behaviours of mothers and non-mothers are evident throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>So, here’s a new way to think about pregnancy — changes to your <em>body </em>ensure your baby is carried safely to term; and changes to your <em>brain</em> ensure you’re prepared for the social and emotional challenges of motherhood.</p>
<h2>Pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in women’s brains</h2>
<p><a class="broken_link" href="https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/images/Hoekzema_NN2016.pdf">A paper</a> published December 2016 in the prestigious journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> gave us our first detailed insight into how pregnancy changes the structure of women’s brains. Using MRI, a team of Dutch and Spanish researchers lead by <a href="https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/senior-investigator/190-research-fellows/233-elseline-hoekzema">Elseline Hoekzema</a> scanned the brains of twenty-five first-time mothers before and after pregnancy, and compared their brains to twenty women who’d never been pregnant.</p>
<p>Pregnancy was associated with pronounced and long-lasting changes in the structure of women’s brains.</p>
<p>In particular, grey matter volume was lost. The loss wasn’t random, but was from the same cortical regions in every woman, specifically, regions of the cortex related to social cognition, empathy and theory of mind, which is the ability to read the desires and intentions of others from their faces and actions. The hippocampus, a region associated with memory, also lost volume.</p>
<p>The brain changes were long-lasting. Two years after the initial scan, eleven of women who hadn’t fallen pregnant for the second time were invited back and their brains scanned again. In all women, the grey matter shrinkage had endured, except for in the hippocampus, which had recovered volume.</p>
<h2>Is grey matter shrinkage a good thing for a new Mum?</h2>
<p>In some ways, the plastic changes are not dissimilar to those seen in adolescence when pubertal hormones trigger thinning of the grey matter in teenager’s brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Synaptic pruning in adolescence is generally regarded as an essential process of fine-tuning connections into functional networks and is thought to represent a refinement and specialization of brain circuitry, which is critical for healthy cognitive, emotional and social development,” says Hoekzema.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s likely a similar process of maturation and specialisation of the social brain is taking place during pregnancy. Loss of grey matter volume sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more, and reflects ‘functional streamlining’, not degeneration.</p>
<h2>Brain changes are related to empathy and reading the emotions of others</h2>
<p>Because the grey matter changes occurred in regions associated with theory of mind and empathy, Hoekzema and her team ran a series of additional tests, to see if changes were related to real-life skills. Interestingly, data revealed the greater the degree of grey matter plasticity, the greater the strength of the connection and bonding between a mother and her baby.</p>
<p>Usually, MRI and fMRI research examining brain structure shows changes to be very subtle and many thousands of people must be scanned to detect small differences. In this case, the grey matter changes induced by pregnancy were anything but subtle. Notably, a computer program was able to automatically determine whether or not a woman had undergone pregnancy based only on her brain scans!</p>
<h2>So, what is it about pregnancy that sculpts women’s brains?</h2>
<p>Hoekzema and colleagues propose it is</p>
<blockquote><p>“The unequaled surges of sex steroid hormones that a woman is exposed to during her pregnancy”.</p></blockquote>
<p>The endocrine climate of pregnancy may drive grey matter refinement via changes in the number of synapses, glia, dendritic structures, blood vessels or myelination.</p>
<p>The process of becoming a parent for the first time is an intense, all-encompassing experience, so the obvious question to ask is, whether it is pregnancy, the act of caring for a child, or another factor such as sleep deprivation that tinkers with brain structure?</p>
<p>The team tested for the effects of parenting versus pregnancy in a rather ingenious way — they scanned the brains of first-time fathers before and after their wife’s pregnancies. They found no changes in the structure of the men’s brains after they took on dad-duties, which strongly suggested any changes in the women were related to the biological changes of pregnancy rather than the process of parenting.</p>
<h2>Similar brain changes are seen in other mammals</h2>
<p>Female rodents can’t read books to find out what to expect when they’re expecting or how to tame toddlers. Therefore, changes in how new rodent mothers think, feel and behave must be driven entirely by biology.</p>
<p>Behavioural neuroscientists who study the neurobiology of parenting, say,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The maternal brain is both the goal of the endocrine tsunami that accompanies pregnancy, and the culmination of millennia of natural selective processes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The emergence of maternal behaviours and superior cognitive abilities has been neatly mapped on to the ‘maternal circuitry’ in the female rodent brain. Like human mothers, rat mother’s brains are structurally different thanks to the hormones of pregnancy and the enriching experience of caring for their young.</p>
<h2>Does this data mean pregnancy is <em>necessary</em> for parenthood?</h2>
<p>Ummm. No.</p>
<p>It’s important to note this study does not imply fathers nor non-birth mothers lack the ‘parenting brain circuitry’ or a ‘theory of mind’, and it certainly does not let them off the hook from parenting! We don’t need neuroscience to support or deny that fact, anyway. Babies need warm, secure attachment with at least one loving caregiver to organise and regulate healthy brain development.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one very influential biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that benefit the transition into motherhood.</p>
<p>A birth mother is not the only adult capable of being such a caregiver. This data simply shows pregnancy is a very influential bottom-up biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that may benefit the transition into motherhood.</p>

<p>All kinds of animals use their bodies to signal a high social rank — humans included. But a growing body of research suggests that, for us at least, there are two distinct routes to becoming a leader. One entails earning respect and followers by demonstrating your knowledge and expertise, which confers prestige. An alternative strategy is to use aggression and intimidation to scare people into deference — that is, to use dominance instead.</p>
<p>These two ways to the top are very different. And, to get on with their leader, an inferior-status individual would have to respond to these two types of leadership differently, too. So, reasoned, Zachary Witkower and Jessica Tracy at the University of British Columbia, and colleagues, rather than a single human high rank, “power” display, perhaps there are two distinct patterns of non-verbal behaviour that communicate to other individuals exactly what kind of leader someone is.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-22179-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, reveals that this is indeed the case. This is important for understanding how we display rank, and perceive and respond to it. It could also explain why studies into <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">“power posing”</a> have produced conflicting results.</p>
<p><span id="more-39096"></span></p>
<p>Earlier work has found that prestigious leaders — think Barack Obama, say — tend to be empathic and helpful towards their followers, and that their willingness to share their expertise with subordinates is crucial to their status. To maintain support and devotion from their followers, such a leader would, then, need to signal not only that they have a high status but that they are also warm, caring and pro-social. In contrast, dominance-type leaders (think no end of despots) would have to also signal their aggressiveness to maintain their status.</p>
<p>Across many species, sheer physical size — or making yourself look bigger — sends a high-status message. In people, an “expansive” posture, with arms and legs away from the body, and the chest puffed out (which is associated with pride) has been linked to high-status, too. The team reasoned that both prestige and dominance leaders would use these postures, but that a downward head tilt (which other work has shown is intimidating) and no smile would signal dominance, while an upward head tilt and a smile would signal prestige.</p>
<p>Four studies that involved presenting US-based adults with either computer-generated avatars or photos of actors adopting various poses provided good evidence for this theory — raters did indeed separately associate prestige and dominance with these two distinct displays. The researchers also noted that there were no gender differences in the participants’ judgements.</p>
<p>For the fifth study, 191 students who didn’t know each other were assigned to 36 same-gender groups. They completed a decision-making test individually, and then were videoed while they worked on this same task in their group. Afterwards, each participant rated each of the others in their group for prestige, dominance, social influence and liking. Separately, two research assistants who watched the videos rated each for social influence. Independent coders also noted the presence, and intensity, of prestige or dominance displays in the videos.</p>
<p>The team found that students who adopted more obvious prestige displays were given higher prestige ratings. Also, anyone who displayed prestige was consistently judged to have exerted more influence over the group.</p>
<p>The results on dominance were a little more mixed: those rated higher for dominance indeed adopted more expansive stances, but were no more likely to tilt their head downwards or not smile.</p>
<p>The researchers also noted, however, a difference between the expansive postures used by those rated high for prestige vs dominance: prestige was associated with more chest expansion, whereas dominant students spread their limbs more — which could have the effect of making them seem more invasive of other people’s personal space.</p>
<p>For their final study, the team turned to videos of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump — leaders taken to exemplify prestige and dominance strategies, respectively — during the 2016 presidential debates. Independent raters found that Clinton indeed engaged in more smiling and upward head tilting than Trump, who engaged in more downward head tilting. Also, Clinton displayed relatively more chest expansion, but Trump occupied more space, and extended his arms out from his body more.</p>
<p>Together, these studies “provide strong converging evidence that dominance and prestige are associated with distinct nonverbal signals which naturally emerge in ecologically valid group settings and real-world rank contests, and result in rank conferral from others,” the team writes.</p>
<p>The work could also help to explain inconsistencies from studies that have looked at non-verbal behaviour in relation to social rank, but not made the distinction between prestige and dominance. Given the difference that the team observed in the physical stance associated with prestige vs dominance, this might have implications for understanding power posing (which involves a combination of the two), the researchers write. “Regardless of what the future holds for power posing, researchers who seek to test this account should more rigorously consider the specific make up of the behaviours involved in the pose,” they write.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/vaping-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Social inequalities in smoking rates are often recognized as one of the most important factors contributing to social inequalities in health. Since around 2011, e-cigarettes have become popular as an alternative method of nicotine delivery, thought to be substantially less harmful. <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8270-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our new study</a> looks at social inequalities in vaping (use of e-cigarettes) in the UK (2015-2017) and finds that young people (aged 10-15) and adults (aged 16+) who are more disadvantaged in terms of education, income and occupation are more likely to be vaping.</p>
<p>However, when we looked at this by whether people smoked, different findings emerged. There was little evidence of social inequalities in vaping among adults who had never smoked or were currently smoking, but among adults who had previously smoked, those from households which were more disadvantaged were still more likely to vape. Among young people, relatively few had smoked before, but clear social inequalities in vaping were still present among those who had never smoked. Interestingly, while more advantaged adult smokers were generally more likely to have quit smoking than less advantaged adults, this inequality was smaller among those who vaped.</p>
<p>The role of smoking is important because interpretations of whether e-cigarettes are good or bad can depend on who is using them, and who they are being compared to. While the long-term health effects of vaping are not yet known and vaping may be associated with some harm, these harms are thought to be relatively small compared to the strong harms that we know to be associated with smoking. This means, for example, that while vaping among those who have never smoked might be a concern, vaping among smokers and ex-smokers is more desirable because it can involve people switching away from smoking.</p>
<p>Our finding of inequalities in vaping among young people who had never smoked could therefore indicate some potential for widening of health inequalities, in that there may be some harm associated with vaping. This is something to keep monitoring, but there are good reasons not to be alarmed. Vaping among young people in the UK is still very rare (~3% in our study), so any impact is likely to be limited. Furthermore, some of the children using e-cigarettes could be trying them instead of traditional cigarettes, which would likely be much more harmful.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="wp-image-11663 aligncenter" height="306" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/graph-300x171.png" width="537" />On the other hand, smoking is often considered to be one of the main contributors to social inequalities in health. Our finding of smoking cessation inequalities among vaping adults being narrower than for adults overall suggests that e-cigarettes may be helping disadvantaged smokers to quit. Although this difference wasn’t large, it could potentially have a big impact on health inequalities because giving up smoking is very beneficial for people’s health.</p>
<p>In this initial study, vaping had only been measured once, so it is hard to untangle the dynamics of how vaping and smoking behavior can impact on each other. Possible previous vaping that was not captured in the study could have biased some of our estimates, and both the inequalities in vaping among adult ex-smokers, and the weaker inequalities in smoking cessation among those who vaped could also have been caused by disadvantaged ex-smokers being more likely to take up vaping (relapsing to use of nicotine, but not cigarettes).</p>
<p>Future research with vaping and smoking measured at repeated intervals will help clarify these issues and help us understand the overall population impact of these different processes, but these initial findings suggesting that vaping may weaken inequalities in smoking cessation, while remaining rare among youth, are encouraging.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-6146 alignright" height="300" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/woman-wearing-red-hat-and-sunglasses-1729931-258x300.jpg" width="258" /><em>By Dr Kate Gregorevic, Geriatrician, Writer and Founder of <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/">Projet ThreeSixFive</a>. </em></p>
<p>Dementia has now overtaken cancer as the most feared disease for people aged over 65, and with good reason. The cognitive changes and memory impairment can cause significant distress. Since around a third of people aged eighty-five and over have dementia, most people will know someone with this condition.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I’m asked is what dementia actually <em>is.</em> I say that dementia is an umbrella term that means a progressive loss of memory and thinking that leads to a decline in function. This means people losing the ability to do things they used to be able to do well, whether it’s cooking or managing complex spreadsheets.</p>
<p>There are many different diseases that cause dementia, but the most common ones are Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia and these are also the ones that are most responsive to lifestyle change.</p>
<p>These are my top ten tips for reducing the risk of dementia.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Nutrition</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389">Predimed</a> trial was conducted in Spain and recruited thousands of people to look at a <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the-mediterranean-diet/">Mediterranean</a> diet, which was high in vegetables, legumes and fish, with minimal refined carbohydrates. 447 of those people were recruited to an additional study where they had a cognitive assessment, then divided into three groups. One group were on the control low-fat diet, one group had extra olive oil, the other group had extra nuts. For the groups supplemented with olive oil or nuts, there was a slowing in the rate of cognitive decline.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a population based study of 191 women in Sweden, a higher level of fitness in midlife was associated with a much lower risk of dementia. The women were given an exercise test in 1968, then over the years they had detailed cognitive assessments. When the results were analysed, 44 years after the study started, 15% of the least fit women had dementia compared to 0% of the fittest. Of course this is a small study, and exercise won’t get rid of all the risk, but it’s pretty inspiring to hit the gym.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After even one night of poor sleep, our brains are not functioning at the optimal level, so it’s not surprising that poor sleep in the long term is very bad for cognition. While we sleep, our brains perform critical housekeeping tasks, including consolidating memories and getting rid of the day’s garbage. Both short and long sleep duration are predictive of dementia, with sleeping less than 6 hours or more than 8 hours being a risk. These studies are complicated to interpret, because sleep disturbance is frequently an early sign of dementia, so this could be a sign of the disease rather than the cause. There are many <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/10_tips_for_better_sleep/">evidence based lifestyle strategies to improve sleep</a> and personally I’m going to continue to enjoy being well-rested rather than find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Manage stress and mental illness</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Depression and dementia have an interesting relationship. One of the challenges of diagnosing dementia is that many of the early symptoms mimic depression, like apathy and a lack of interest in activities that someone usually enjoys. Depression and anxiety can also impair memory function. While the question of whether depression causes dementia is still to be answered, it is concerning that people with moderate to severe dementia have reduced hippocampal volume, a key brain structure for memory. Chronic stress can also alter cortisol release and may influence inflammation. If you are feeling overwhelmed, or experiencing a low mood, it is a good idea to see your doctor to look at a treatment plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Avoid alcohol and cigarettes</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While 1 or 2 glasses of wine a few days a week is unlikely to do harm, in larger amounts alcohol is very bad for the brain and can cause dementia. Alcohol is freely able to cross the blood brain barrier and can cause damage to brain cells. Similarly, smoking is linked with systemic inflammation and poor blood vessel health, and our brains are highly dependent on blood flow to function properly.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Keep your blood vessels healthy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the brain is an energy-hungry organ that relies on a good blood supply, it makes sense that healthy blood vessels are good for the brain. There are three important and treatable factors that your doctor can check for: diabetes, high blood pressure and high levels of unhealthy fats in the blood. These are all bad for blood vessels and over time can compromise blood supply to the brain. Seeing your GP for regular check-ups can ensure these are picked up early and are treated.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Keep your brain busy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While many people look forward to retirement, for some people this is associated with a decline in cognitive function. Of course, it is also possible people are retiring (or being retired) because there is already a decline, but for many people work is actually very good for their brains. While ‘brain training’ apps have become increasingly popular, there is no convincing evidence they prevent or slow dementia. While practising a brain training app will help you to get better at the brain training app, this won’t necessarily translate to helping with day-to-day function, so it’s important to find activities to challenge yourself and incorporate them into life.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2>Get your hearing checked</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hearing loss increases with age, and poor hearing is a risk factor for dementia. While it is important to protect your hearing by trying to avoid too much exposure to loud noise, it is also important to have a hearing check and to get treatment. While there is still insufficient evidence to prove hearing aids will reduce the risk of dementia, these can improve the quality of life and overcome a barrier to participating in social settings.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2>A sense of purpose</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most interesting studies I’ve come across took a cohort of older adults and tested their cognitive function and asked about whether they felt their life had purpose and meaning. After these people died, the researchers did an autopsy on their brains to look for changes consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. People with <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the_power_of_purpose/">a higher sense of purpose</a> had a higher level of cognitive function while they were alive, and this sense of purpose was still protective even if they had changes in their brain consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2>Social and emotional connection</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People with fewer social connections are at higher risk of developing dementia. This might be because loneliness, which is a stress state for social animals such as us, can lead to increased cortisol release and inflammation. Social activity is also excellent for adding enjoyment to life, so maintaining connection or making some new friends is a great way to protect your brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are worried about your own memory, or someone you love, it is really important to get it checked out. Sometimes there are reversible causes of cognitive decline, like B12 deficiency, low levels of thyroid hormone or severe depression. If it is the beginning of cognitive decline, it is also helpful to know so you can plan for ways to stay healthy and independent for as long as possible.</p>
<p>One incredibly reassuring fact is that while the number of people with dementia is rising as most people reach very old age, the risk is actually decreasing. This means that you probably have a lower risk of dementia than your parents at the same age. Incorporating these ten strategies, and the risk might be lower yet!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></h4>

<p>Imagine that you’ve just been appointed the head of operations for a five-star hotel in Manhattan. Your boss calls you in her office on your first day and says: “Our biggest problem is how slow elevators are. Everyone complains about it, and we can’t have that. Speed them up.”</p><p>How would you do it?</p><p>Most people intuitively focus on speeding up the elevators: installing stronger motors, modifying the dispatch algorithm, getting the doors to shut faster, or even installing additional elevators. But there is also a whole set of options that consists of giving the impression that the elevators are faster, for instance by distracting the users with windows or, on the cheaper side, with mirrors, TVs, or newspapers.</p><p>Facing a complex challenge, it’s tempting to pursue whichever option we first identify and start implementing it quickly. But <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-big-idea-before-you-make-that-big-decision">relying on this kind of intuitive thinking, particularly</a><u> </u>in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">unpredictable</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">environments</a><u>, </u>might result in poor outcomes —<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19739881">even when we have a high degree of confidence</a>.</p><p>Instead, we should first identify the range of solutions that are available to us, which is challenging, because we don’t know what we don’t know. It’s like being an explorer a few hundred years ago who would land on an uncharted piece of land having to decide how to explore it. Well, there is a time-tested approach: map it.</p><p>Facing that complex challenge, your first task should be to frame your problem in the form of an overarching question that, once answered, will lay out your proposed plan of action. A good way to frame your problem is to summarize that key question and its context in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/frame-with-a-situation-complication-question-sequence/">a situation- complication-question sequence</a><u>. </u>Once you’ve framed your problem, you should then think of alternative ways—or options—to solve it before deciding which one is on balance the best.</p><p>A question map<em> </em>helps you explore that universe of potential options. Question maps are similar to other knowledge cartography tools, such as mind maps, decision trees, and the issue trees that management consultants use. But question maps are also different from these tools in that they obey their own rules, four rules that actively drive structure into your problem-solving process.</p><ol><li><strong>1. Good question maps answer a single type of question</strong><br />The first rule of good question maps is that they answer a single type of question. Facing a complex problem, we face two types of questions: why and how. A why question is problem centric; it helps you to diagnose your problem, uncovering its root causes and, ultimately, enabling you to summarize your problem in a more insightful key question. In contrast, a how question is solution centric: It enables you to consider all the possible solutions to your problem.One type of question isn’t consistently better than the other. Both are useful and, in general, you want to ask why before you ask how.</li><li><strong> Good question maps go from the question to potential options</strong><br />The second rule of good question maps is just as simple: Start your map at your key question and explore all possible answers—the so-called solution space. This requires you to think in a divergent pattern. Vertically, use your map to uncover the various facets of your question, with each branch addressing a different dimension. Horizontally, use your map to go into more details eventually identifying concrete, tangible answers.So, if your question is how you should make your clients happy with the speed of your elevators, you might start a map with two ideas: “by speeding up the elevators” and “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster.” You can then continue exploring these ideas into further and further details.<p></p><p>You should continue that divergent thinking pattern as long as doing so brings value. This will typically result in a map with dozens of ideas over at least five layers. For a why question, this progression in further depth is equivalent to the five-whys methodology—but don’t limit yourself to just five, if it makes sense to drill deeper, do so. Since it would be intractable to treat each one of these ideas as a separate option, you then converge by summarizing your entire map in a set of two to ten formal options.</p></li><li><strong> Good question maps have a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive structure</strong><br />Next, consider all the possible answers to your question exactly once. That is, give your map branches that are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/be-mece/">mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1"></a> (or MECE<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2"></a>). Giving your map this structure is a critical element of the process, and in most cases, it isn’t easy to do, as it requires you to think both creatively and critically. So, expect to spend some effort here—and by “expect to spend some effort,” I mean that if you don’t feel some frustration, you’re not doing it well!</li><li><strong>Good question maps are insightful</strong><br />The final rule of good maps is that they should have an insightful structure. That is, the structure should be both logically valid and useful. Concretely, this means finding a way to structure the map that helps bring some new, useful light into your question. This is especially important for the first cut, the top-most node of the map.</li></ol><p>Striving to be insightful also means that you need to keep developing your map until you identify concrete answers. Don’t stay at a philosophical level (e.g., by just writing “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster”) but identify concrete ways to answer your question (“by installing mirrors in the elevators”).</p><p><img height="923" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png" width="1583" /></p><p> </p><p>Question maps only have four rules, and those are simple enough to understand. Following them when solving a complex problem, however, can be, let’s say, challenging. But realize that the complexity isn’t in the map; the complexity is in the problem, all that the map does is expose that complexity so that you can better address it. So, embrace the challenge, and happy mapping!</p><p><em>Feature image by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/8Q6aHbve5hI">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/617935874/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f02%2fhow-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/seven-psychology-books-that-explore-why-we-are-who-we-are-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">Seven psychology books that explore why we are who we are [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-dating-apps-reflect-our-changing-times/" rel="nofollow">How dating apps reflect our changing times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-youth-could-save-the-earth/" rel="nofollow">How youth could save the Earth</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>Recent years have seen a proliferation of mental health apps that claim to help relieve symptoms of depression. But there’s not much evidence that they really do anything,</strong> <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/02/do-mental-health-apps-do-any-good/">writes Tom Chivers at <em>Unherd</em></a>. Even in the few cases where there has been research into the effectiveness of the apps, the studies are often small and uncontrolled, raising questions about how solid the results are.</p>

<p><strong>Ever felt like pop songs are getting sadder? Well, you’re not wrong,</strong> <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-are-pop-songs-getting-sadder-than-they-used-to-be">according to researchers Alberto Acerbi and Charlotte Brand</a>, writing at <em>Aeon</em>. The pair analysed more than 150,000 songs released between 1965 and 2015, scanning the lyrics for words related to positive and negative emotions. Over the years there was an increase in the use of negative words, and decrease in positive ones. The team suggests that this is a result of “cultural evolution”: songs with negative emotion words tended to be more popular, and so in subsequent years songs contained even more negative lyrics.</p>

<p><strong>Could war crimes be prevented if the military were to screen recruits for specific personality traits?</strong> In <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-we-discovered-a-personality-profile-linked-to-war-crimes-130622">researchers Magnus Linden and David Whetham report </a>that elements of the “dark triad” of personality traits were found to be related to unethical behaviour among peacekeepers. “It may be inevitable that atrocities happen in war”, they write. “But that doesn’t mean that some, or even many, ethical violations could not be prevented. To do this, we have to take more notice of the evidence that we have available.”</p>

<p><strong>Concerns about the effects of smartphones and other technologies are increasingly in the headlines. But what does the evidence say? </strong>Amy Orben, research fellow at the University of Cambridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/01/amy-orben-psychology-smartphones-affecting-brain-social-media-teenagers-mental-health">talks to <em>The Guardian</em></a> about her research into digital technology and the wellbeing of young people. We talked to Amy in our latest PsychCrunch podcast — if you haven’t heard it yet, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">check it out here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And when it comes to concerns about technology, there are also matters of race and privilege to consider.</strong> In <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/teachers-less-likely-to-take-phones-away-from-white-privileged-children-120810">Emeline Brulé and Matt Rafalow report</a> the results of their study looking at the way teachers from different schools perceive students’ use of digital technology. Teachers from a private school with mainly white students tended to see technology use as beneficial to the kids’ education, while those at schools with more marginalised students were more likely to perceive it as simply “messing around”.</p>

<p><strong>We already knew that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/10/good-at-heart-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-better-side-of-humanity/">toddlers can be surprisingly selfless</a> — but a new study has found that even babies as young as 19 months display altruistic behaviour. </strong>Babies willingly gave a piece of fruit to an adult who clearly wanted it but was unable to reach it, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/altruistic-infants-wellness/indhttps:/edition.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/altruistic-infants-wellness/index.htmlex.html">report Sandee LaMotte and Kristen Rogers</a> at <em>CNN</em> — even at meal times, when they themselves were hungry.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, a viral tweet questioning whether we all have an inner monologue led to <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/what-does-your-internal-monologue-say-about-your-mental-health-21777794">this story</a> in <em>Mic</em> from Tracey Anne Duncan.</strong> Psychologists agree we all have “self-talk”, Duncan writes, but this doesn’t have to involve words — it also includes imagery and sensations. And what’s less clear is exactly how the content of that self-talk reflects our mental health. (Whether we all hear a voice in our head when we <em>read</em> is another question — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/">something we covered</a> back in 2016).</p>

<p>For people with painful or disruptive symptoms, a medical diagnosis can have emotional and tangible benefits such as peace of mind from having a ‘known cause’ of the symptoms, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738399118308838" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social support</a>, access to funded services, and <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0265-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">knowledge of treatment options</a>. But diagnostic labels can also have harms, such as <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.153775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">levels of distress</a>, a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-and-cognitive-psychotherapy/article/an-experimental-investigation-of-the-impact-of-personality-disorder-diagnosis-on-clinicians-can-we-see-past-the-borderline/4A2E43B72792EEB68C497CF95ABBA0D7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change in perceived control over one’s own health</a>, and <a href="https://www.healio.com/nursing/journals/rgn/2009-4-2-2/%7B4db0b00a-5889-4996-923d-b00767e2327a%7D/diagnostic-labels-stigma-and-participation-in-research-related-to-dementia-and-mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reductions to health service access</a>. All diagnostic labels have different benefits and harms for different groups, but the harms are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11017-017-9412-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly an issue for people with no symptoms</a> – they may experience the harms with no benefit. This can happen when we screen for diseases before symptoms are felt, such screening for vitamin D deficiency or the current thought to screen all adolescents for depression.</p>
<p>Where expert panels draw the arbitrary line between ‘disease’ and ‘no disease’, or diagnosis and no diagnosis, requires <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2626860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">careful balancing</a> of these harms and benefits. An example of a change to the threshold for diagnosis, which has caused a global difference in how women experience their pregnancy, is in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). GDM is a diagnosis some otherwise healthy pregnant women receive when they are found to have elevated blood sugar (glucose). In 2010, the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) changed their <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/33/3/676.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diagnostic threshold and testing procedure for GDM</a>, which over the past decade has been accepted at different times by some countries and not at all by others. This change now includes as GDM more cases that had previously been considered borderline or not GDM. Although this expert panel selected this new diagnostic threshold with the best of intentions about possible benefits, they did not consider the harms of a GDM diagnosis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What do women tell us about the impacts of GDM on their lives?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are numerous interview studies that examined the psychosocial impact on women of a diagnosis of GDM. In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2745-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new systematic review</a> of these important studies, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, we present the first synthesis of the psychosocial benefits and harms of a GDM diagnosis.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11665 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/the-meter-3357128-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>We synthesized the results of 41 qualitative studies and found eight overarching themes: psychological impact, communication, knowledge, risk perception, management, burden, social support, and control. For example, when initially diagnosed, GDM was viewed both positively and negatively. Some women considered it a life-altering experience and a chance to positively intervene to reduce potential adverse outcomes for themselves and their babies:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘GDM was a hidden blessing for me … GDM can go away after you have the baby but diabetes is not so easily fixable … I am much more aware of [the] need to prevent it.’</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, most women reported reactions such as self-blame, failure, fear, sadness, concern and confusion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘I was very surprised and very upset to be diagnosed. I felt a little bit of a failure.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Because it is really ugly to have, in fact I wanted to have another baby and since I got this I do not want to anymore.’</em></p>
<p>Some women also talked about the burden of having a diagnosis of GDM and that communication about the condition was lacking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘The whole pressure with the whole everything, it really did affect me and I think it’s probably one of the worst times I’ve had in my life actually.</em>’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Like they don’t have time to sit there and talk to you about what to do about it [GDM], but they are always in a hurry [… ] so I just don’t bring it up and they don’t bring it up; so you just get checked out and leave.’</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is this important?</strong></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/33/3/676.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence used by IADPSG</a> to determine the new threshold between a diagnosis of GDM and no diagnosis was based on a positive (and continuous) association between blood glucose levels and physical harms to babies such as the risk of the baby being big for gestational age, excess infant fat, and maternal insulin levels. These potential consequences focused on physical harms to mother and baby but there was no evidence of physical benefits to mothers or babies if the threshold changed and none for psychosocial harms and benefits for the mother. Understanding the full range of harms and benefits of a diagnosis of GDM is critical before any <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2626860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changes to definitions</a> should be made.</p>
<blockquote><p>…consequences of a diagnosis of GDM go beyond the potential physical risks to mothers and babies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results are clear that consequences of a diagnosis of GDM go beyond the potential physical risks to mothers and babies. <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023293.abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research</a> <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jog.13544" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence</a> is also <a href="http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2016/2670912.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accumulating</a> that the change in GDM definition has increased the number of women diagnosed with GDM but may not be having a significant impact on decreasing the physical consequences. In addition to the clinical outcomes already considered, more attention should be paid to the consequences of GDM that women themselves consider important.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Three potential solutions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disease definition panels should have a population focus.</strong> Expert panel groups are composed of clinicians working in tertiary environments where they encounter a significant proportion of clinical/physical harms. These then tend to dominate their world view. However, what health conditions are called and the threshold between disease and no disease is a public health (as opposed to tertiary health) concern. <a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/24/5/170" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These panels should be more inclusive</a> of clinicians and members of the public.</li>
<li><strong>Panels should include community recommendations</strong>. To aid in a public health focus, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953617301429" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommendations of informed community members</a> most affected by the disease and its potential change should be included alongside those of experts and clinicians.</li>
<li><strong>New, inclusive criteria should be used to change disease definitions.</strong> Any changes considered by these panels should be guided by criteria recently suggested by an <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2626860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international working group</a>. For example, how many new people would be affected, what are the net benefits and harms of the new definition compared with the old, and how well does the new definition predict clinically important outcomes?</li>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em>Dan Carney</p>
<p>One of the most well-known psychological biases is the Dunning-Kruger effect: the tendency for individuals less skilled or knowledgeable in a particular area to overestimate their own performance. Now, a team of researchers from Miami University, Ohio, have offered the most robust evidence yet that this may apply to knowledge about autism — that what people think they know about the condition may not be that closely related to what they actually know.<br />
<span id="more-39071"></span></p>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946719301874">March issue of <em>Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders</em></a>, the authors — led by Camilla McMahon — measured perceived and actual autism knowledge in a sample of 331 members of the US public, with a range of incomes and educational backgrounds.</p>
<p>Participants’ perception of their own knowledge was assessed using the specially created Perceived Autism Knowledge Questionnaire, consisting of six statements regarding symptoms (e.g. “I can recognise the signs and symptoms of autism”). Participants were required to respond to each on a scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”.</p>
<p>Actual knowledge was measured with the Autism Symptomatology Knowledge Assessment, a list of 25 symptoms — ten specific to autism (e.g. “failure to initiate or respond to social interactions”), and fifteen to other conditions (e.g. “depressed mood”) — each requiring a yes/no response regarding whether it can be used to make an autism diagnosis. Lastly, participants estimated both their own score, and their performance in comparison with others, on the actual knowledge measure.</p>
<p>Strikingly, no correlation was found between performance on the perceived and actual autism knowledge measures: people’s beliefs about their own knowledge were not related to their actual knowledge levels. In addition, participants with the highest actual knowledge levels were more likely to underestimate both their own scores on that measure, and their performance in comparison with others. The opposite pattern was found for those with the lowest actual knowledge, who tended to overestimate both their scores and their comparative performance.</p>
<p>The manner of the separation between perceived and actual knowledge suggests that autism knowledge may be prey to the Dunning-Kruger effect, which could have real-world implications. For instance, lower-knowledge individuals working with autistic people may not only provide inferior support due to lesser knowledge, but also — due to higher self-confidence — fail to correct themselves or try to improve. According to McMahon and her team, future research should examine specific professional groups (e.g. paediatricians or teachers), where a combination of high perceived and low actual knowledge may lead to errors in areas such as diagnosis and intervention.</p>
<p>And if more knowledgeable individuals are underestimating both their own absolute and relative knowledge of autism, this suggests that they may be overestimating the knowledge of others. This could also lead to inferior provision in professional contexts, as it may cause knowledgeable individuals to defer to others who do not share their level of expertise</p>
<p>The results also have implications for autism researchers: McMahon and colleagues point out that studies of autism awareness have often treated measures of perceived and actual knowledge interchangeably, when attempting to assess the latter. They recommend that researchers should bear the distinction in mind in future, and consider more carefully which of the two they wish to examine.</p>
<p>One limitation of the study, which the authors acknowledge, was that the measures were administered as part of a larger investigation that required participants to read a brief educational statement on autism and then answer questions on their own judgements of, and receptivity to, individuals with the condition. This process may have temporarily inflated knowledge levels and affected responses on the measures.</p>
<p>Overall, however, this study is the most detailed investigation to date of the Dunning-Kruger effect in autism, and provides an intriguing platform for further work. It suggests that initiatives to increase autism knowledge may need to be targeted at those who do not think of themselves as needing support, and should also aim to enhance people’s awareness of their own knowledge level.</p>
<p>Understanding the way that people perceive their knowledge relative to others could also inform situations in which those from different professional fields (e.g. teachers, social workers or educational psychologists) are required to reach joint decisions on provision for autistic people. This may enable better collaborative judgements, made by professionals able to gauge their own expertise level – and that of those around them – more accurately.</p>

<p>When you can’t quite put your finger on how you’re feeling, don’t worry — there may be a non-English word that can help you out. There are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/28/there-are-at-least-216-foreign-words-for-positive-emotional-states-and-concepts-that-we-dont-have-in-english/">hundreds of words</a> across the world for emotional states and concepts, from the Spanish word for the desire to eat simply for the taste (<em>gula</em>) to the Sanskrit for revelling in someone else’s joy (<em>mudita</em>).</p>
<p>But what about those words that exist across many languages — “anger”, for example, or “happiness”? Do they mean the same thing in every language, or do we experience emotions differently based on the culture we are brought up in? Is the experience we call “love” in English emotionally analogous with its direct translation into Hungarian, “szerelem”, for example?</p>
<p><span id="more-39062"></span></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">new paper in </a><em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">Science</a>,</em> Joshua Conrad Jackson from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <span>and colleagues l</span><span>ooked at 2,439 distinct concepts (including 24 relating to emotion) from 2,474 languages. The team analysed the similarities and differences between languages based on patterns of “colexification”: instances in which multiple concepts are expressed by the same word form.</span></p>
<p>In Persian, to use the team’s example, the word <em>ænduh</em> can be used to express both grief and regret; in the Dargwa dialect, spoken in Dagestan in Russia, <em>dard</em> means grief and anxiety. It follows, therefore, that Persian speakers may understand grief as closer to regret, and Dargwa speakers closer to anxiety.</p>
<p>The analysis allowed the researchers to create networks of concepts that showed, for each language family, how closely different emotional concepts related to each other. These revealed wide variation between language families. For instance, in Tad-Kadai languages, which can be found in Southeast Asia, southern China, and Northeast India, “anxiety” was related to “fear”; in Austroasiatic languages, anxiety was closer to “grief” or “regret”. In Nakh Daghestanian languages spoken mainly in parts of Russia, on the other hand, “anger” was related to “envy”, but in Austronesian languages it was related to “hate”, “bad”, and “proud”.</p>
<p>But there were some similarities. Words with the same emotional valence — i.e. that were positive or negative — tended to be associated only with other words of the same valence, in all language families across the world. Happiness, for example, was linked to other positive emotions, even if the specific associations were slightly different depending on the language family. (This wasn’t always the case though: in some Austronesian languages, “pity” and “love” were associated, suggesting pity may be more positive or love more negative than in other languages). Similarly, low-arousal emotions like sadness were also unlikely to be compared to high-arousal emotions like anger.</p>
<p>And geography also seemed to matter: language families that were geographically closer tended to share more similar associations than those that were far away.</p>
<p>The study’s findings suggest that emotional concepts do vary between languages up to a point, raising the question of just how similar supposedly universal experiences are. Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly how somebody else is experiencing the world, and language can often be woefully inadequate when it comes to expressing our internal life. And while the research suggests that those emotional experiences may vary in subtle ways across the world, deep down it seems we’re not so dissimilar at all.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk talk about the paper "Hyperbolic geometry of the olfactory space".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the natural environment, the sense of smell, or olfaction, serves to detect
toxins and judge nutritional content by taking advantage of the associations
between compoundsas they are created in biochemical reactions. This suggests
that the nervous system can classify odors based on statistics of their
co-occurrence within natural mixtures rather than from the chemical structures
of the ligands themselves. We show that this statistical perspective makes
it possible to map odors to points in a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic coordinates
have a long but often underappreciated history of relevance to biology. For
example, these coordinates approximate the distance between species computed
along dendrograms and, more generally, between points within hierarchical
tree–like networks. We find that both natural odors and human perceptual
descriptions of smells can be described using a three-dimensional hyperbolic
space. This match in geometries can avoid distortions that would otherwise
arise when mapping odors to perception.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617533986/0/oupblogpsychology/">Using math to understand inequity</a></h4>

<p>What can math tell us about unfairness? Bias, discrimination, and inequity are phenomena that are deeply complex, context sensitive, personal, and intersectional. The mathematical modeling of social scenarios, on the other hand, is a practice that necessitates simplification. Using models to understand what happens in our social realm means representing the complex with something much less complex in order to study it.</p><p>Nonetheless, when used carefully models can help us learn about deep patterns related to inequity, including those that govern how unfair norms and patterns of behavior emerge in groups of people.   They are especially useful in highlighting spaces of possibility.   What might happen in the complex dynamics of the social realm?   Once we answer this question, we can use experiments and experimental studies to learn more about these possibilities.</p><p>In recent work by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-017-1487-8">fellow modelers</a> and myself, we’ve looked in particular at what minority status means for patterns of unfair behavior.   Suppose you are part of a company where people work together, but are still figuring out some of the social rules for how this is done.  Suppose further that men make up the majority of workers and women the minority.  And lastly suppose, as argued by Cecilia L. Ridgeway in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/framed-by-gender-9780199755783"><em>Framed by Gender</em></a><em>,</em> that like most humans your coworkers notice gender, and use it to shape their interactions with others in ways that can be subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle).  In a case like this, even without gender biases coming into play, women can end up disadvantaged.</p><p>The basic mechanism for this disadvantage relates to the speed with which people learn to interact with others.  Say that men make up 90% of office workers, and women 10%.   This means that 90% of the time women will be interacting with their “out-group”, while men will be doing the same thing only 10% of the time.  We can reasonably expect that women figure out how to treat men in the office more quickly than the reverse.  This is a general observation about minority status, majority members are, on average, exposed to the other group less, and so learn about them less quickly.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/100/2/593.short">Evolutionary biologists have shown</a> that when it comes to mutualistic interactions between species, sometimes the species that evolves more quickly ends up at a disadvantage simply by dint of this quick evolution.   This is called <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.yalescientific.org/2017/01/the-red-king-effect-winning-the-co-evolutionary-race/">The Red King Effect</a>.   Surprisingly, starting with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-017-1487-8">the work of Justin Bruner</a>, it has become clear <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2017.1335723?casa_token=XCCUFW32j0AAAAAA%3AgtFFyQjpNe_MF8aFFylQqSrKpOniqgbC52wAQu-8FmRwYVf1Nl6MM-WAPl_F8SC2oNFBLvAz_zTjXQ">that a similar thing might happen in the cultural realm</a>.  How?</p><p>When it comes to joint action – doing a project together, or forming a company, or running a household – a bargain of a sort is needed to figure out who does how much labor, and who gets what rewards.  The bargain need not be explicit, but somehow the issue must be settled.  In general, accommodating demands tend to be safe ones in bargains.  If you accommodate, usually your partner will be satisfied.  When individuals are quickly learning to bargain with another group, this means that in many cases they quickly move towards accommodation.  (Think, “don’t worry, I’ll finish the memo” or “I’ll stay to finish cleaning up”.)  Once this happens, the majority group can more slowly learn to take advantage of this accommodating behavior by demanding a lot of their partners.</p><p>Under other conditions, small groups can actually gain an advantage by learning quickly.  This depends on the details of the kind of interaction they are engaged it.   <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2017.1335723?casa_token=tHKpgYMp7ogAAAAA%3AjqZ1MnA5A_DtCztagI8J0d5gsUcQ6Lg8svltSoj-ar0c_97uwYUJXfFW3yJqAAwAmo58JsnKc2DARg">I’ve argued, though</a>, that in many real-world cases we should expect conditions to hold that will disadvantage minority groups, including those with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02691728.2018.1555870?casa_token=W6XigWXJPkYAAAAA%3AWBeXM5luOtXR7LaO8g_BEgKb8eU-ugrQdhoynEVYFw2dIxevMAd_dASgp7rtLExLmC1dXYdMHGPF">intersectional identities</a>.</p><p>Of course, much discriminatory behavior is more nefarious than this.  It often involves racial, gender, or other biases against members of certain social groups.  Given what we’d found in our models, though, my collaborators and I began to wonder whether this simple mechanism – based only on group size and learning speed – could lead to disadvantage for real humans.</p><p>We asked experimental subjects to engage in bargaining interactions between two groups.  One group was smaller than the other, but otherwise the two groups were completely identical.  After having the groups learn to interact with each other, we checked to see how much money they had earned through their bargaining.  <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-019-02424-1">We found that</a>, on average, the smaller groups earned significantly less, perhaps because of the very mechanism we had identified.  This study is not definitive.  It is relatively small, and involves restrictive lab conditions.  But it points to a general take-away about the use of simplified models to study complex social phenomena.</p><p>Without the models we developed to study inequality, we never would have guessed that just being in a small group might be a disadvantage.   There was no a priori reason to test such a hypothesis.  Once modeling work opened up this possibility, though, it gave us reason to experiment.  In general, models can point us to possibilities we might never have imagined without computational resources.  They can tell us what dynamical effects might plausibly occur in the social realm.  Of course, they can’t tell us for sure whether or not these effects are actually at play.  But they can direct us towards empirical work that we otherwise would never  have engage in.  When used carefully, and with the right back and forth with other methods, models are an important part of the social science toolbox, even for topics as complex as unfairness.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a
