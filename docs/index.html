              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-beam-atom-molecule-quantum-physics">New ‘vortex beams’ of atoms and molecules are the first of their kind</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like soft serve ice cream, beams of atoms and molecules now come with a swirl.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew how to dish up spiraling beams of light or electrons, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twisted-way-take-pictures">vortex beams</a> (<em>SN: 1/14/11</em>). Now, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj2451">the first vortex beams of atoms and molecules</a> are on the menu, researchers report in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Vortex beams made of light or electrons have shown promise for making special types of microscope images and for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-communication-takes-new-twist">transmitting information</a> using quantum physics (<em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). But vortex beams of larger particles such as atoms or molecules are so new that the possible applications aren’t yet clear, says physicist Sonja Franke-Arnold of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, who was not involved with the research. “It’s maybe too early to really know what we can do with it.”</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wave-function-directly-measured">described by a wave function</a>, a wavelike pattern that allows scientists to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular place (<em>SN: 6/8/11</em>). But vortex beams’ waves don’t slosh up and down like ripples on water. Instead, the beams’ particles have wave functions that move in a corkscrewing motion as a beam travels through space. That means the beam carries a rotational oomph known as orbital angular momentum. “This is something really very strange, very nonintuitive,” says physicist Edvardas Narevicius of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.</p>





<p>Narevicius and colleagues created the new beams by passing helium atoms through a grid of specially shaped slit patterns, each just 600 nanometers wide. The team detected a hallmark of vortex beams: a row of doughnut-shaped rings imprinted on a detector by the atoms, in which each doughnut corresponds to a beam with a different orbital angular momentum.</p>



<p>Another set of doughnuts revealed the presence of vortex beams of helium excimers, molecules created when a helium atom in an excited, or energized, state pairs up with another helium atom.</p>

<p>Next, scientists might investigate what happens when vortex beams of molecules or atoms collide with light, electrons or other atoms or molecules. Such collisions are well-understood for normal particle beams, but not for those with orbital angular momentum. Similar vortex beams made with protons might also serve as a method for probing the subatomic particle’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">mysterious innards</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>In physics, “most important things are achieved when we are revisiting known phenomena with a fresh perspective,” says physicist Ivan Madan of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, who was not involved with the research. “And, for sure, this experiment allows us to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured solid evidence of a rare double cosmic cannibalism — a star swallowing a compact object such as a black hole or neutron star. In turn, that object gobbled the star’s core, causing it to explode and leave behind only a black hole.</p>



<p>The first hints of the gruesome event, described in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg6037">came from the Very Large Array</a> (VLA), a radio telescope consisting of 27 enormous dishes in the New Mexican desert near Socorro. During the observatory’s scans of the night sky in 2017, a burst of radio energy as bright as the brightest exploding star — or supernova — as seen from Earth appeared in a dwarf star–forming galaxy approximately 500 million light-years away.</p>



<p>“We thought, ‘Whoa, this is interesting,’” says Dillon Dong, an astronomer at Caltech.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues made follow-up observations of the galaxy using the VLA and one of the telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which sees in the same optical light as our eyes. The Keck telescope caught a luminous outflow of material spewing in all directions at 3.2 million kilometers per hour from a central location, suggesting that an energetic explosion had occurred there in the past.</p>





<p>The team then found an extremely bright X-ray source in archival data from the Monitor of All Sky X-ray Image (MAXI) telescope, a Japanese instrument that sits on the International Space Station. This X-ray burst was in the same place as the radio one but had been observed back in 2014. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecing the data together, Dong and his colleagues think this is what happened: Long ago, a binary pair of stars were born orbiting each other; one died in a spectacular supernova and became either a neutron star or a black hole. As gravity brought the two objects closer together, the dead star actually entered the outer layers of its larger stellar sibling.</p>



<p>The compact object spiraled inside the still-living star for hundreds of years, eventually making its way down to and then eating its partner’s core. During this time, the larger star shed huge amounts of gas and dust, forming a shell of material around the duo.</p>



<p>In the living star’s center, gravitational forces and complex magnetic interactions from the dead star’s munching launched enormous jets of energy — picked up as an X-ray flash in 2014 — as well as causing the larger star to explode. Debris from the detonation smashed with colossal speed into the surrounding shell of material, generating the optical and radio light.</p>



<p>While theorists have previously envisioned such a scenario, dubbed a merger-triggered core collapse supernova, this appears to represent the first direct observation of this phenomenon, Dong says.</p>



<p>“They’ve done some pretty good detective work using these observations,” says Adam Burrows, an astrophysicist at Princeton University who was not involved in the new study. He says the findings should help constrain the timing of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00159-013-0059-2">a process called common envelope evolution</a>, in which one star becomes immersed inside another. Such stages in stars’ lives are relatively short-lived in cosmic time and difficult to both observe and simulate. Most of the time, the engulfing partner dies before its core is consumed, leading to two compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes orbiting one another.</p>



<p>The final stages of these systems are exactly what observatories like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detect when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">capturing spacetime’s ripples</a>, Dong says (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>). Now that astronomers know to look for these multiple lines of evidence, he expects them to find more examples this strange phenomenon.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">Some wasps’ nests glow green under ultraviolet light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beam a black light into some Vietnamese forests at night, and brilliant green bulbs may glow in the trees. These eerie lanterns are the nests of several species of Asian paper wasps, and the gleam comes from <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0418">silk fibers in the nests</a> that fluoresce when struck by ultraviolet light, researchers report in the August <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>.</p>



<p>“When you see it, it&#8217;s just magic,” says chemist Bernd Schöllhorn of the Molecular Electrochemistry Lab at the University of Paris and CNRS.</p>



<p>Schöllhorn and colleagues discovered the nests while searching forests in Vietnam for fluorescent insects using powerful UV torches. “It looked like somebody turned on a flashlight in the forest, but nobody was there,” he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="457" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082721_no_wasp_inline.jpg" alt="A paper wasp nest in Vietnam glows at night" class="wp-image-3103105" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082721_no_wasp_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082721_no_wasp_inline-570x383.jpg 570w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082721_no_wasp_inline-670x450.jpg 670w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082721_no_wasp_inline-277x186.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103105">A paper wasp nest fluoresces in a northern Vietnamese forest at night.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103105">Bernd Schöllhorn, Serge Berthier</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fluorescence occurs throughout the animal kingdom. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">Platypuses</a>, scorpions and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fluorescent-frogs-might-see-each-others-glow">polka dot tree frogs</a>, for example, all fluoresce under UV light (<em>SN: 11/6/20; SN: 4/3/17</em>). After analyzing the fluorescence of the nests of some Asian paper wasps (<em>Polistes </em>spp.) in the lab, the researchers found that silk threads in the nests glow more brilliantly than other documented fluorescent biomaterials.</p>



<p>The nests of one wasp species, <em>P. brunetus</em>, emitted about one-third as much light as they absorbed. And in some cases, the nests were visible by the naked eye from up to 20 meters away. “We haven&#8217;t seen any other example like that,” Schöllhorn says. The fluorescence must benefit the wasps somehow, the researchers say, though it’s unclear how. One hypothesis is that the nests protect larvae inside from UV radiation by absorbing some of the harmful energy and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-water-bear-glow-blue-ultraviolet-light">dissipating it as visible light</a>, Schöllhorn says (<em>SN: 10/13/20</em>). Or, as the sun directly casts its last UV light at the end of the day, the nests might shine bright enough amid the darkening foliage to help wayward wasps find home, like beacons at twilight.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>In 1995, a seminal book was <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I2pHAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">published</a> suggesting that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were exposed to 30 million fewer words than richer children by the age of 4 — the so-called &#8220;word gap&#8221;. The idea is now widespread and has informed early childhood policy in the United States (though the findings are more <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/the-long-contentious-history-of-the-word-gap-study/562850/">contentious</a> than this ubiquity might suggest).</p>



<p>But why might these kids be exposed to fewer words? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">new study</a> from a team at the University of California, Berkeley, finds that worries about financial insecurity reduced the amount that caregivers spoke to their small children, suggesting that these concerns themselves could be at least partly responsible for the word gap.</p>

<p>Participants were 84 caregivers and their three year old children. First, a caregiver and their child were seated across from each other at a table, and while the child completed an unrelated experiment with a researcher, caregivers were placed into one of two conditions.</p>



<p>In the scarcity condition, caregivers were asked to reflect on three or four times in the past week when they didn’t have enough of something or when resources were scarce, writing a brief reflection about two of those experiences. In the control condition, caregivers wrote about two things they had done in the last week.</p>



<p>When the caregiver had completed the survey, they were left alone with their child and a shape sorting puzzle which allowed, but didn’t obligate, them to engage in speech. A video camera recorded their interactions, with researchers using transcripts to analyse the quantity and quality of language used by caregivers.</p>



<p>Results showed that those in the scarcity condition used fewer words than those in the control condition as well as fewer word <em>types</em> (e.g. nouns, adjectives, and other categories), though this latter difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, caregivers who reflected specifically on <em>financial</em> insecurity spoke to their children significantly less than those who focused on other forms of scarcity (such as time).</p>



<p>A second study looked at more natural, daily environments, using publicly available audio recordings of children and their caregivers taken over multiple days. The team looked specifically at changes in conversation towards the end of the month, which previous research has identified as a period when people of all income groups are less financially secure.</p>



<p>Across all of the recordings, back and forth interactions between caregivers and children were reduced during the last week of the month. Children themselves were also on average less likely to use language during this week compared to the rest of the month, though adult speech overall was not reduced during this period. The results also held for caregivers from all financial brackets.</p>



<p>Though the end of the month may, on the whole, be a time of relative financial stress, the study was not able to isolate this as the key factor in reduced speech; further research could look more closely at times of difference in vocalisation between caregivers and children, using specific measures of financial stress to understand the link.</p>



<p>The findings could go some way to explain <em>why</em> parents who are struggling financially might talk less to their children. The team suggests that parents have less time and attention to speak to their children when stressed or anxious. “If you are worried about putting food on the table, or scraping together money for that medical bill, or figuring out where to enroll your child in school now you have been evicted, you may be less likely to narrate the colour of the sky to your child as you ride on the bus,” they write.</p>



<p>As noted, however, there are also issues with the concept of the word gap altogether: <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13072">recent longitudinal research</a> failed to replicate the findings of the 1995 study, suggesting it may not be as cut and dry as assumed. But limitations aside, there is certainly one serious takeaway from the study: the importance of considering external, material factors on childcare and parenting. While individual interventions may solicit some positive results, looking at wider social and political factors could be a better way of addressing childhood inequalities than putting the onus on individuals.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">What causes the word gap? Financial concerns may systematically suppress child-directed speech</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">Fires may have affected up to 85 percent of threatened Amazon species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much of the Amazon’s biodiversity is under fire — literally.</p>



<p>In the last two decades, deforestation and forest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03876-7">fires have encroached on the ranges of thousands of plant and animal species</a> in the Amazon rainforest, including up to 85 percent of threatened species in the region, researchers report September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The extent of the damage is closely tied to the enforcement, or lack thereof, of regulations in Brazil aimed at protecting the forest from widespread logging as well as the fires often used to clear open space in the forest and other encroachments. The findings illustrate the key role that forest use regulations have in the fate of the Amazon rainforest, the researchers argue.</p>



<p>Threats to the survival of this biodiversity could have long-term effects. Biodiversity boosts a forest’s resilience to drought, says Arie Staal, an ecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved with this research. A deep bench of tree species allows the plants to replace those that may not survive drought conditions, he says. “If fire-impacted area continues to rise, not only does the Amazon lose forest cover, but also some of its capacity to cope with the changing climate.”</p>





<p>And as fires advance deeper into the rainforest, more species will experience fire for the first time, Staal says. “These species, including many threatened ones, have not evolved under circumstances with regular fires, so the consequences for those species can be severe.” Such consequences may include increased risk of population declines or extinction, similar to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">fears following the major outbreak of fires in Australia</a> in 2019 and 2020 (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>In recent decades, ongoing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-amazon-trees-endangered">deforestation</a> and periodic drought in the Amazon basin have been associated with intensifying fires there (<em>SN: 11/20/15</em>). In 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-amazon-rainforest-fires-climate-emissions-oxygen">a particularly severe series of fires</a> scorched the region (<em>SN: 8/23/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we do not know how fires are impacting the biodiversity across the Amazon basin,” says Xiao Feng, a biogeographer at Florida State University in Tallahassee.&nbsp;The Amazon “is a huge area, and it is generally impossible for people to go there and count the number of species before the fire and after the fire,” he says. “That’s an incredible amount of work.”</p>



<p>So Feng and a team of collaborators from Brazil, China, the Netherlands and the United States instead investigated how Amazonian plant and animal species’ geographic ranges have been exposed to recent fires. The team compiled range maps of 11,514 plant and 3,079 vertebrate species, creating what may be the most comprehensive dataset of range maps for the Amazon. The team compared these maps with satellite images of Amazon forest cover from 2001 to 2019. Those images let the team track how logging and fires have led to the degradation of rainforest habitat.</p>



<p>Fire impacted up to about 190,000 square kilometers — an area roughly the size of Washington state, the team found. Up to about 95 percent of the species featured in the study had ranges that overlapped with fires during this period, though for many species, burned areas made up less than 15 percent of their overall range.</p>



<p>Affected species include up to 85 percent of the 610 considered threatened — so vulnerable to extinction or already endangered or critically endangered — by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This category includes as many as 264 kinds of plants, 107 amphibians and 55 mammals. In 2019 alone, over 12,000 species experienced fire somewhere in their geographic range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting in 2009, when a series of regulations aimed at reducing deforestation started being enforced, the extent of fires generally decreased, except in drought years, the team found. Then in 2019, fires ticked back up again, coinciding with a relaxation of regulations. Much of the fire-driven forest loss was congregated along the more intensely logged southern reaches of the rainforest.</p>



<p>The shift suggests that effective forest preservation policies can slow this trend of destruction, and may be crucial for preventing the region from reaching a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2007.0036?ct=">tipping point</a>. That point would occur when the cycle of deforestation, drying and fire triggers widespread transformation of the Amazon basin into a savanna-like habitat.</p>



<p>While this study couldn’t track the fate of specific plants or animals, Feng now plans to look at fire’s impact on certain groups of species that may have very different vulnerabilities to an increasingly flammable Amazon. “We know some trees may be more resistant to burns, but some may not. So it may also be really important to distinguish differences,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arabia-stone-age-tools-humans-migration-green-lakes-desert">Stone Age humans or their relatives occasionally trekked through a green Arabia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Arabia, known today for its desert landscape, served as a “green turnstile” for migrating Stone Age members of the human genus starting around 400,000 years ago, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Monsoon rains periodically turned northern Arabia into a well-watered oasis, creating windows of opportunity for long-ago humans or their relatives to trek through that crossroads region from starting points in northern Africa and southwest Asia.</p>



<p>That’s the implication of a series of five ancient lake beds of varying ages, each accompanied by distinctive stone tools, unearthed at a northern Saudi Arabian site called Khall Amayshan 4, or KAM 4. Sediments from the lake beds, which were linked to periods when the climate was wetter than today, also yielded fossils of hippos, wild cattle and other animals. Like hominids, those creatures must have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03863-y">migrated into the region along rain-fed lakes</a>, wetlands and rivers, an international team reports online September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, the oldest stone tools in Arabia <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-homo-stone-tools-north-africa-arabia-early">dated to at least 300,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/18</em>). Previous finds only hinted that Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> or other <em>Homo</em> species temporarily inhabited green, wetter parts of Arabia, a conclusion largely resting on discoveries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-hint-hominids-migrated-through-green-arabia-300000-years-ago">at two other Saudi sites, each preserving stone tools from a single point in time</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>Aside from providing the earliest known evidence of hominids in Arabia, the new finds demonstrate for the first time that ancient <em>Homo</em> groups traveled there when conditions turned wet, say archaeologist Huw Groucutt of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and colleagues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2.jpg" alt="Khall Amayshan 4 site pictured from above" class="wp-image-3103164" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103164">Evidence of hominid occupations at five ancient lake sites, each dated to a different Stone Age time, was found at northern Saudi Arabia’s Khall Amayshan 4 site (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103164">Michael Petraglia/Palaeodeserts Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result, northern Arabia could have served as a key, if intermittent, passageway out of Africa for humans or close evolutionary relatives <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sharp-stones-found-india-signal-surprisingly-early-toolmaking-advances">who reached South Asia by around 385,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/18</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-going-europe-humans-ventured-east-asia">southern China between 120,000 and 80,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/15</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-people-arrived-sumatra-rainforests-more-60000-years-ago">the Indonesian island of Sumatra between 73,000 and 63,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>The number, completeness and time frames of KAM 4’s ancient lake deposits make this site “one of a kind … that will continue to produce remarkable results,” says archaeologist Donald Henry of the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>Across five occupation phases covering hundreds of thousands of years, different <em>Homo</em> species or closely related populations at KAM 4 “were doing broadly the same things,” Groucutt says. Small groups camped by lakes where individuals made stone tools for food preparation, hunting and woodworking.</p>



<p>But each phase, dated mainly by a technique that estimated the amount of time since grains of lake sediment had last been exposed to sunlight, had its own evolutionary character.</p>



<p>For example, the identity of the KAM 4 crowd 400,000 years ago, who left behind large hand axes, is unclear, but the researchers know it couldn’t have been <em>H. sapiens</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">Our species didn’t originate until roughly 300,000 years ago in Africa</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>). One possibility is that those ancient Arabians represented a now-extinct <em>Homo</em> population from southwest Asia that later migrated into Africa, possibly contributing to <em>H. sapiens</em> evolution, Groucutt speculates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="316" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg" alt="a stone hand axe shown from four different angles" class="wp-image-3103165" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1-330x153.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103165">Members of an unidentified <em>Homo</em> group left behind stone hand axes such this one (shown from different angles) along the shore of a northern Arabian lake about 400,000 years ago.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103165">Ian Cartwright/Palaeodeserts Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Similar but slightly smaller, more finely worked hand axes turned up along the shore of a roughly 300,000-year-old KAM 4 lake bed, indicating a second phase of occupation. Groucutt and colleagues doubt that early <em>H. sapiens </em>from Africa scurried over to KAM 4 in time to make those tools. Whichever <em>Homo</em> group did could have come either from northern Africa or southwest Asia, the researchers say.</p>



<p>A third round of KAM 4 occupants, probably <em>H. sapiens</em>, fashioned artifacts excavated at an approximately 200,000-year-old lake bed, Groucutt says. These finds consist of rock chunks shaped so that sharp flakes, also unearthed there, could be pounded off. Humans based in northeastern Africa around that time made similar tools. Some of those people may have reached Arabia before eventually journeying to southwest Asia, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>Groucutt’s group excavated comparable tools at a site called Jubbah about 150 kilometers east of KAM 4 that date to around 210,000 years ago. Those finds are another sign of human migrations into Arabia at a time when the corresponding KAM 4 lake bed shows that wet conditions reigned. Additional stone tools unearthed at Jubbah date to around 75,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Stone implements resembling the Jubbah finds were also excavated at the youngest two KAM 4 sites, one dating to between about 125,000 and 75,000 years ago and the other to roughly 55,000 years ago. The older site likely hosted <em>H. sapiens</em>, possibly a group that left Africa, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>The youngest KAM 4 artifacts could represent either <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals, he says. Neandertals reached the Middle East by about 70,000 years ago and could have reached a green Arabia by 55,000 years ago. If so, Neandertals may have interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> in Arabia, a possibility not raised before.</p>



<p>Despite uncertainties about which hominids reached KAM 4 during its green phases, KAM 4 tools generally look more like similarly aged African tools than artifacts previously found in southern Arabia or at eastern Mediterranean sites, says Henry, the University of Tulsa archaeologist. Migrations out of Africa, he says, now appear more likely to have wended through northern Arabia rather than across a narrow Red Sea crossing to southern Arabia, often regarded as a major dispersal route for ancient humans.</p>

<hr />
<p>Violence is a complex issue that remains a public health priority globally. Violence is not equally distributed across society but disproportionately impacts people who face health and social inequities. People who experience health and social inequities, such as homelessness, unemployment, mental illness and substance use disorders, are also more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>My PhD research examines how we can prevent deaths and injuries from violence among adults and young people who have had contact with the criminal justice system in Australia. My work primarily relates to SDG 5, achieving gender equality and empowerment for all women and girls and SDG 16, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. Preventing violence and deaths from violence is specified in three targets to achieve these goals. Target 5.2 aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, target 16.1 aims to reduce deaths from violence and target 16.2 aims to end all forms of violence against children.</p>
<p>A key challenge for this research is that the violence experienced by people who have had contact with the criminal justice system is rarely recognized as a health issue. This is despite violence being declared a priority for public health by the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42495/9241545615_eng.pdf">World Health Organization</a> almost two decades ago, and <a href="https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/98971/E94242.pdf">health of those who had had contact with the criminal justice system</a> being recognized as an important part of public health.</p>
<p>If we are to uphold the United Nations pledge of <em>‘<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">leaving no one behind’</a></em>, then we must consider the violence experienced by this population as a serious health issue in need of targeted, evidence-informed prevention efforts. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0886260520905546">My research</a> has established that people who have contact with the criminal justice system have a risk of dying from violence that is far greater than the risk experienced by the general population in Australia.</p>
<p>Ignoring the violence experienced by this population ignores the connection between health, violence and criminal justice system involvement. Many adults and young people who have experienced incarceration were victims of violence <em>before</em> they had contact with the criminal justice system. The <a href="https://www.anrows.org.au/publication/womens-imprisonment-and-domestic-family-and-sexual-violence/">vast majority (70-90%) of women</a> in prison have been victims of violence, most frequently intimate partner and family violence. For many of these people their violence victimization was connected to the reasons for their criminal justice system involvement. For example, people may turn to substance use as a coping strategy after being a victim of violence and are then subsequently charged with using or possessing substances. Young people may leave their home and become homeless after experiencing family violence, which in turn may increase the likelihood that they have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>We need to challenge and address the stigma that people who have had contact with the criminal justice experience, which continues long after their contact with the system. People who have had contact with the criminal justice system are part of the community and do not exist separately from it. Even those who are incarcerated usually only spend a relatively short period of time in prison before being released back into the community. As such, improving the health of this population and reducing the violence they experience is likely important to reducing health inequities at the population level and achieving SDGs 5 and 16.</p>
<p>People who have had contact with the criminal justice system need to be recognized as a priority group for violence prevention. Additionally, the health and social inequities that are drivers of death and injuries of violence, as well as criminal justice system involvement need to be addressed.</p>
<p>The impact of experiencing violence on health and behavior must be considered when people have contact with the criminal justice system. Our criminal justice systems need to be <a href="http://www.nasmhpd.org/sites/default/files/Women%20in%20Corrections%20TIC%20SR(2).pdf">trauma-informed and include trauma-informed responses</a>, which includes diversion to more appropriate services, such as mental health and family violence services. Without which, we may be further entrenching a cycle of disadvantage and violence in this population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">Perspective-changing experiences, good or bad, can lead to richer lives</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In December, my husband, our 5-year-old daughter and I tested positive for COVID-19. Life, already off-kilter, lurched. Smell, taste, breath — were they normal? The air smelled only of cold; everything tasted vaguely of cardboard.</p>



<p>The state mailed us a pulse oximeter to read oxygen levels from our fingers. The device beeped when those levels dipped too low — a seemingly objective measure during a subjective time. We used the device with abandon, only my husband regularly triggering the alarm. He went to bed, where he stayed for days, or maybe it was weeks. Time distilled into moments: remote school, meals, Christmas, pulse-ox, beep.</p>



<p>We exited quarantine on January 1, the day of fresh starts. Except my once energetic 8-year-old son, who somehow never tested positive, now loafed in front of the heater for hours. My husband, his breathing still abnormal and his fatigue lingering, raged. Ever the extrovert, I absorbed their emotions as my own. My risk calculation shifted, as despair overshadowed the fear of disease. The sickness we had hid from for so long had found us anyway. Were we now immune? Should we proceed just as before?</p>



<p>Prior to the sickness, I’d been researching <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic">pandemic fatigue</a>, a term used to describe the boredom that can arise during a protracted crisis like the one we’re in now (<em>SN Online: 2/15/21</em>). “People prefer action to inaction,” social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville told me. For some, that compulsion toward the experiential runs deep, she and colleagues reported in 2014 in <em>Science</em>. When the researchers gave college students a choice between sitting idly in a quiet room or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330241/">pushing a button to receive an electric shock</a>, a startling number went for the shock.</p>



<p>I have been seeking, and pushing, that button all my life. I’ve taught English in Japan, worked as a national park ranger and, following an unfortunate series of events, sold pineapples along a tourist highway in Hawaii in exchange for a tent over my head. Westgate’s recent work suggests that button pushing sorts often flourish in rich and aesthetic environs. I took heed. Against the dreary backdrop of being homebound in a global health crisis, I signed up for private pottery lessons, drawn viscerally to the idea of creating something from mud.</p>

<h4>A third path</h4>



<p>Psychologists who study well-being or human flourishing have long posited that the “good life” can be pursued via two paths: happiness or meaning.</p>





<p>“So far, psychologists worked with this dichotomy — a dichotomous model of well-being about life,” says psychologist Shigehiro Oishi. He describes the happy life as one of joy, comfort and security, and the meaningful life as one of significance, purpose and coherence, or order. Happiness and meaning can run parallel or intersect, Oishi says. Both concepts are largely rooted in personal and societal stability.</p>



<p>What happens, though, when the ground beneath one’s feet buckles? Or what if one was never quite stable to begin with? What hope is there for finding a path to the good life?</p>



<p>For the last six years, Oishi and his team at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville have been hammering out their response: a third path to the good life coined “psychological richness.” Their research suggests that the ingredients of a rich life come not from stability in life circumstances or in temperament. Rather, the path to a rich life arises from novelty seeking, curiosity and moments that shift one’s view of the world. Rich experiences are neither inherently good nor bad; they may be intentional or accidental, joyous or traumatic.</p>



<p>The pandemic, in this light, embodies a novel, perspective-changing, psychologically rich moment. It has shattered our routines and livelihoods, robbed us of our loved ones and plunged many into despondency. But it has also steered some of us to the mud. We have captured wild yeast for sourdough breads, planted gardens and knitted sweaters; we have stared at a wet mound of clay on a wheel and wondered, what next?</p>



<p>This third good life path can provide a balm in difficult times, says Westgate, Oishi’s former graduate student. “Psychological richness opens up an avenue to the good life for people for whom circumstances may seem to have cut off paths to happiness and meaning.”</p>



<h4>Aristotle’s legacy </h4>



<p>If you want to understand psychological richness, read about Oliver Sacks, advises Lorraine Besser, a philosopher at Middlebury College in Vermont and Oishi’s collaborator. She is thinking of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html">an adieu to the world</a> that Sacks wrote in the <em>New York Times</em> in February 2015, shortly after learning he was dying of cancer.</p>



<p>The renowned author and neurologist drew his inspiration from philosopher David Hume, who had written a similar adieu in 1776. Hume described himself as possessing a “mild disposition,” Sacks wrote. “Here I depart from Hume. While I have enjoyed loving relationships and friendships and have no real enmities, I cannot say (nor would anyone who knows me say) that I am a man of mild dispositions. On the contrary, I am a man of vehement disposition, with violent enthusiasms, and extreme immoderation in all my passions.”</p>



<p>Ancient discussions of the good life do not appear to consider Sacks’ model. Instead, fourth century B.C. Greek philosopher Aristotle looms large in this esoteric space. He opens his treatise, Nicomachean Ethics, by <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html">reviewing the various contenders for the good life</a> — pleasure, honor, wealth, health or eminence — eventually arriving at “eudaimonia,” essentially human flourishing. The eudaimonic person, Aristotle wrote, “is active in accordance with complete virtue … not for some unspecified period but throughout a complete life.”</p>





<p>Of those contenders, only pleasure and eudaimonia, the “feeling good and being good” sides of that dichotomous coin, have withstood the long test of time, Westgate says.</p>



<p>Aristotle, an unequivocal be-gooder, considered the good life an objective ideal. So does Susan Wolf. “Some philosophers, including me, say a good life isn’t just good from the inside,” says Wolf, a moral philosopher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Instead, a life must also be good from the outside, or from the perspective of one’s community.</p>



<p>But the emergence of positive psychology several decades ago shifted attention from the collective to the individual. Now, Westgate says, “whether or not it’s a good life is really in the eyes of the person who led that life.”</p>



<h4>Sacks’ vision </h4>



<p>Sacks’ early years were marked by heartache, according to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/stream-oliver-sacks-his-own-life-documentary/17521/">a documentary of his life</a> that aired on PBS in April. Born in 1933 in London, Sacks was sent to a boarding school during World War II, where the other children bullied him and his older brother, Michael. In that environment, Michael became psychotic and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The family was devastated. Then, when Sacks was 18, his parents discovered he was gay. His mother, with whom he shared a close bond, called him an “abomination.”</p>



<p>“Her words haunted me for much of my life and played a major part in inhibiting and injecting with guilt my sense of my own sexuality,” Sacks said.</p>



<p>Sacks fled to San Francisco on his 27th birthday and interned at a medical center. Off hours, Sacks muscled up, eventually lifting a 600-pound bar from a squat to set a California weight lifting record. He also got hooked on amphetamines, thereby sleeping and eating little, while roaring high and fast on his motorcycle. Sacks, the documentary suggests, was running from his own overwhelming loneliness.</p>



<p>“That kind of sensitivity is dangerous. It requires a degree of appetite, vitality, a responsiveness, which means that you could go off the rails at any moment,” the documentary’s director Ric Burns tells me. “The question becomes: What is the relationship you’re going to have to your own appetites?”</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve 1965, Sacks stared into the abyss of his drug addiction. “I looked at my emaciated face and I said, ‘Oliver, you will not see another New Year’s Day unless you get help,’ ” Sacks recalled in the documentary.</p>



<p>Six months later, Sacks began seeing migraine patients at a clinic in New York City. During what would turn out to be his last amphetamine high, Sacks read a 500-page book on the theory behind migraines, with detailed case studies, written by physician Edward Liveing in the 1870s. “I read through the whole book in a state of ecstasy,” Sacks said. “With the amphetamines in me, sometimes it seemed to me that the neurological heavens opened and that the migraine was shining like a constellation in the sky.”</p>



<p>After that vision, Sacks began writing detailed accounts of his patients’ experiences, a process that merged his intellectual and creative passions. Embarking on this psychologically rich literary journey would sustain Sacks throughout his life.</p>



<h4>Beyond the dichotomy </h4>



<p>In fall 2015, Westgate was a graduate student in Oishi’s lab. With lab members squeezed into his tiny office for a meeting, Westgate recalls, Oishi walked in and asked: “Is happiness and meaning all there is?”</p>



<p>That meeting and the ensuing discussion marked a turning point for Oishi. He had, like most well-being researchers, been publishing papers that worked within the happiness-­meaning dichotomy. Yet he had grown disillusioned by those paths’ shortcomings. For instance, why, as research has consistently shown, did happiness hinge on having considerably more money than is strictly necessary? And why did homogenous friend circles give people more happiness and satisfaction in their lives than diverse circles?</p>



<p>After that meeting, Westgate recalls, the team homed in on one question: If you lack money and stability, can you still have a good life?</p>



<p>The team looked for a third path, one filled with rich, aesthetic experiences. First the group <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300649">developed a scale to measure psychological richness</a>. The scale mirrored those used to measure happiness and meaning. Respondents rank 17 statements from 1 for strongly disagree to 7 for strongly agree. Statements include: “On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘I had an interesting life’ ” and “My life would make a good novel or movie.” The results, appearing June 2019 in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, showed that scoring high in a personality trait known as “openness to experience” predicted high richness scores but not necessarily happiness or meaning.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Rich dimensions</h3>



<p>Shigehiro Oishi and colleagues zeroed in on the core dimensions of a psychologically rich life. <strong></strong></p>



<h5>What rings true? </h5>



<p>Below is a sampling of statements Oishi’s team uses to measure a person’s level of psychological richness, or propensity toward novel, perspective-­changing experiences. Participants answer on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p>



<ul><li>I have had a lot of novel experiences.</li><li>My life has been full of unique, unusual experiences.</li><li>My life consists of rich, intense moments.</li><li>My life has been dramatic.</li><li>I experience a full range of emotions via first-hand experiences such as travel and attending concerts.</li><li>I have a lot of personal stories to tell others.</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I had an interesting life.”</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I have seen and learned a lot.”</li><li>My life would make a good novel or movie.</li></ul>

</div>



<p>Later research revealed that people high in richness are also emotionally intense, prone to experiencing strong positive and negative emotions. People high in meaning and happiness, meanwhile, experience positive emotions more strongly than negative emotions.</p>



<p>To see how the three paths — happiness, meaning and richness — play out across life, the team evaluated obituaries appearing in the summer of 2016 in the <em>New York Times</em>, the Singapore-based<em> Strait Times</em> and a local Charlottesville newspaper. Research assistants were tasked with describing obituaries using just 12 adjectives, such as “secure” and “comfortable” for happiness, “fulfilling” and “sense of purpose” for meaning and “dramatic” and “eventful” for psychological richness. Obituaries that scored high in psychological richness also scored high in meaning, but not happiness.</p>



<p>The research, appearing online August 12 in <em>Psychological Review</em>, found that major life events, such as divorce, career changes and personal tragedies, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383524/">linked to higher richness, but not meaning or happiness</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Oishi and his team needed to answer the obvious: Could such an intense, unpredictable and frequently unhappy life really be a path people desired? The researchers asked more than 3,100 people across nine countries — the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, Norway, Portugal, Germany and Angola — to score 15 terms similar to those used in the obituary studies on how closely the terms described their ideal lives on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). A nine-term subset of the 15 terms showed that for most countries, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z#citeas">people’s ideal life was most characterized by happiness and least characterized by richness</a>, the researchers reported June 2020 in <em>Affective Science</em>. Nonetheless, average richness ratings ranged from 3.7 to 5.62, suggesting that people desired some richness in their lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>An ideal life </h3>



<p>When asked to describe how well nine terms that are linked to happiness, meaning or richness described their ideal lives, from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much), average scores among respondents for “rich” words, such as “eventful” and “interesting,” were lower than scores for words describing happiness or meaning, but above the midpoint.</p>

</div>



<p>Given that ambiguity, the researchers then forced participants to choose which life they desired most: happy, meaningful or rich. Fifty to 70 percent of respondents chose terms reflecting happiness and 14 to 36 percent chose meaning as their ideal life. Percentages varied by country, but a sizable minority — 7 to 17 percent — <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z">chose a psychologically rich life</a>.</p>



<p>When the researchers asked 1,611 people in the United States and 680 people in South Korea if their lives would have been happier, more meaningful or psychologically richer if they could undo their greatest regret in life, roughly 28 percent of Americans and 35 percent of South Koreans reported that their lives would have been psychologically richer with a do-over.</p>



<p>“That suggests to me that maybe implicit in a lot of people’s desires is psychological richness: ‘I wish I had taken on that opportunity,’ ” Oishi says.</p>

<h4>Puzzle assembly not necessary </h4>



<p>Not everyone, however, accepts the shift from a good life dichotomy to a good life triad. “There’s a bundle of conversations to be had about these conceptually tethered concepts,” says developmental psychologist Anthony Burrow of Cornell University. “Because for some people, isn’t it possible that a psychologically rich life is a life of purpose, is a life of meaning?”</p>



<p>The critique is valid. As the obituary studies showed, richness and its link to major, often negative, life events appears distinct from happiness. But those negative life experiences can foster meaning. A large body of literature shows, for instance, that natural disasters and other traumatic events can trigger a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth: a transformation that gives people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-how-mass-trauma-affects-mental-health">a newfound appreciation for life and a desire to help others</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>An experiment from several years ago illustrates how this transformation plays out. Before richness was in consideration, behavioral economist Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis sought to understand meaning and happiness in isolation, which was tricky because happy people also tend to lead lives high in meaning and vice versa. The researchers identified only those variables linked to happiness, such as satisfying one’s needs and wants, or only meaning, such as spending time with one’s children. Their findings, appearing in 2013 in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2013.830764">revealed that happiness in isolation is linked to a focus on the present</a> while meaning in isolation connects the past, present and future, often through self-reflection.</p>



<p>The distinction between meaning and richness, as such, hinges on whether stitching together the strands of one’s life, or coherence, is essential to building a good life. People who study meaning say yes; Oishi says no, turning to fiction to make his point. In Muriel Barbery’s 2006 novel <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em> and Rabih Alameddine’s 2014<em> An Unnecessary Woman</em>, the main characters are poor and lonely women who are neither interested in making the world a better place nor feel that their experiences add up to some greater whole. Instead, the two women, Renée and Aaliya, pursue lives filled with consuming literature, art and music, Oishi says.</p>



<p>“Both women appreciate moments of ineffable beauty, Proustian moments of elongated time and aesthetics, and lead a life full of inner richness,” he and colleagues wrote in 2019.</p>



<p>Oishi’s proposition is simple, yet radical: Experiences, whether mostly vicarious as with Renée and Aaliya, or firsthand, can offer a good life without summing up to anything greater than their parts.</p>



<p>“Ideally, we want to have all three: happiness, meaning and psychological richness,” Oishi told me in an e-mail. “But having just one is sufficient to lead a good life.”</p>

<h4>The creative impulse </h4>



<p>After the neurological heavens opened, Sacks published his own book on migraines in 1970. He followed it with <em>Awakenings</em> in 1973, documenting the miraculous recovery and relapse of catatonic patients who began to clap, walk and talk after treatment with a medication for Parkinson’s disease, before fading back into unresponsiveness.</p>



<p>Despite his lifelong intellectual and creative frenzy, Sacks remained ever alone. After a brief fling at age 40, he was celibate for the next 35 years.</p>



<p>“He was not happy. He was creative. He was productive. And he was moving forward,” Burns says. “And I think if one is creative, productive and moving forward, one is moving toward happiness.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="497" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg" alt="Oliver Sacks stands next to Bill Hayes" class="wp-image-3103143" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-524x383.jpg 524w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-616x450.jpg 616w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-254x186.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103143">Oliver Sacks (left) found psychological richness and meaning, thanks to his writings and interactions with patients.

<p>Though Burns uses the term “creative” casually, the pursuit of art seems uniquely suited to those seeking, or forced into, a rich life. “People who score high in openness to experience tend to lead more creative lives,” says Oshin Vartanian, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>And Oishi’s work has shown that aesthetic experiences increase richness. For instance, in a 2020 study in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em>, Oishi and colleagues compared richness levels between <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0890207020962334">students studying abroad and students who remained on campus</a>. Though both groups started at the same richness levels, richness scores among the students studying abroad went up after 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Student diaries revealed that the study abroad students participated in considerably more artistic activities, such as going to museums and concerts, than students who remained on campus. Engagement with art, Oishi says, “explained partially why the study abroad group had higher psychological richness.”</p>



<p>As COVID-19 variants ricochet around the globe, a great many people are now like those students studying abroad — not traveling, but dosed in a different kind of richness. Here, in this foreign terrain, we too seek beauty.</p>



<p>Scientists have largely focused on the artistic genius, the prototypic creative, Vartanian says. But the pandemic suggests that we should also study, and encourage, the everyday creative.</p>



<p>Vartanian counts himself among this everyday lot. During the pandemic shutdown, someone gave him a broken play structure for his children. Vartanian couldn’t access the parts he needed to fix it, so he learned how to chisel and do woodwork to get the apparatus in working order. “Doing things I’d never done before,” Vartanian says, “was so greatly satisfying for me.”</p>



<p>I recognize the feeling. When I entered the pottery studio, I knew nothing of the craft. Simply centering the clay on the wheel took me seven lessons. While I can now center small lumps of clay with relative ease, beautiful forms elude me. A half year on, I have thrown misshapen bowls, a smattering of wobbly cups and precarious vases that fold at the neck. I am, at my own life’s midpoint, awash in imperfect vessels.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="794" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg" alt="image of yellow and blue vases, bowls and cups" class="wp-image-3103142" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-328x383.jpg 328w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-385x450.jpg 385w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-159x186.jpg 159w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-497x580.jpg 497w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-665x776.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103142">Gupta has created an assortment of wobbly vases, bowls and cups.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103142">Adam Goodenough</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>Completing the triad </h4>



<p>In the Venn diagram of the good life, Sacks spent much of his time outside all three circles. By midlife, though, psychological richness had become his beacon.</p>



<p>Yet, in crafting his patients’ stories, Sacks made his life about something larger than himself, Burns says. “He turned the mirror around [and said,] ‘I’m going to look outward in order to also look inward.’ ” Sacks had landed at the overlap between richness and meaning.</p>



<p>Then, in his late 70s, Sacks fell deeply, madly in love. After a lifetime of struggle, he finally felt he belonged, not just in literary or academic circles but within himself. In that adieu, Sacks remarked: “My predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written.”</p>



<p>Gratitude, research shows, is the language of happiness. At the sunset of his life, then, Sacks had arrived at the junction of those three paths.</p>



<p>He nailed the ending, Burns says. “That’s given to very, very few of us.”</p>

<h2>Environmental Sustainability of the “Right to Repair” Medical Equipment</h2>
<p>A medical <a href="https://www.repair.org/">Right-to-Repair</a> (RTR) movement can improve the sustainability and the environmental impact of the medical field.  Yet, the effective implementation of medical RTR remains challenging.  Healthcare systems are progressively relying on linear supply chains based on single-use disposable medical devices. This intrinsically unsustainable paradigm of manufacturing and use of medical equipment contributes to rising healthcare costs and worldwide ecological destruction. The effects imperil public health by contaminating the air, soil, and water, depleting resources, and causing catastrophic climate change. In this respect, sustainable development is making an urgent call to change the way in which the healthcare system satisfies its needs. Medical RTR would enable medical equipment to circulate through technical cycles of reuse, repair, re-purposing and recycling. Hence, medical RTR would make possible the transition of the healthcare system to a more circular economy furthering the goal of providing increasingly complex care in an environment-friendly future. The circular economy is an essential part of the sustainability agenda and has the potential to contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, effective implementation of medical RTR has powerful effects on achieving affordable and sustainable standards for the healthcare system.</p>
<p><strong>“Right To Repair” For A Circular Healthcare Economy:</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_12515" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12515" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-12515" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-300x248.png" alt="" width="300" height="248" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-300x248.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-1024x846.png 1024w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-768x634.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-110x90.png 110w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-640x529.png 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12515" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">The concept of “circular economy” incorporates the reuse, recycling, and repair of materials and products rather than single-use, via more circular production and consumption patterns.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, medical device companies responded by providing technical information and resources to biomedical technicians to meet the needs of front-line healthcare providers.  In the United States (U.S.) last year, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden introduced the RTR act calling manufacturers to provide the technical knowledge and tools necessary for hospitals to repair medical equipment.</p>
<p>Since then, there has been significant progress in the medical RTR movement. On July 9, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed a sweeping executive order urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish RTR regulations and to issue rules preventing manufacturers from imposing restrictions on their product’s repair.</p>
<p>In this respect, medical RTR yields the implementation of a <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept">circular economy model</a> of healthcare that ensures that medical equipment is maintained at the highest value application for a longer lifespan. It provides a way to maximize equipment’s productivity, minimize waste and achieve sustainable standards. The medical RTR can allow medical equipment to flow through technological cycles of repair, reprocessing and reuse. As a consequence, RTR legislation is expected to allow the healthcare sector in the US to become more sustainable, environment-friendly and affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the “Right To Repair” in The Medical Field:</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain systems proved to be vulnerable to disruptions from manufacturing shortages, interrupted transportation systems and price increases. In addition to Covid-19, climate change remains the most important threat to the global ecosystem, including the healthcare system. Therefore, it is critical we act with appropriate concern.</p>
<p>In 2003, large hospitals in the US made up less than 1% of all commercial buildings but used up to 4.3% of all commercial energy consumed in the US. In terms of global warming, US hospitals produced the equivalent of about 215 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 (Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey-CBECS).</p>
<p>Medical RTR appears to be a critical strategy to develop an environment-friendly healthcare sector in addition to fulfilling shortages in medical equipment. Reprocessing and repairs are found to be effective in eliminating waste and improving environmental sustainability. In fact, reprocessing companies in the United-States, Canada and Europe reduced hospital solid waste generation by almost 7,100 tons in 2018 (MacNeill et al., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges to Medical Right to Repair:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the importance of repairability for environmental sustainability, there are challenges to medical equipment’s repair. Safety, security and adaptability are the main challenging considerations to take into account when advancing RTR laws.</p>
<p>First, patient’s safety is a main priority when considering the implementation of medical RTR. Regulations and standards are crucial to ensure quality repairs allowing medical devices to function as planned. In contrast, inaccurate repairs may result in serious and life-threatening implications.</p>
<p>Second, the security consideration needs to be taken into account throughout the repair process. To this end, the patient’s privacy needs to be protected and security against hacking and other cybercrimes needs to be maintained.</p>
<p>Third, medical RTR must be adaptable to continuous healthcare innovations and to the needs of the healthcare system. Medical RTR should respect IP (intellectual property) rights as a way to continue innovation in the medical technology space. Original manufacturers may observe flaws and inefficiencies and innovate in response to clinical demands and the regulation should not inhibit these evolving specifications. However, in contexts where urgent repairs can be life-saving, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, medical RTR can help reconcile the need to preserve innovation with the need for repairability and openness in the setting of patient care.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map to A Circular Healthcare Economy:</strong></p>
<p>To make the medical RTR effective, wrong practices of design for programmed obsolescence have to disappear in order to achieve effective long-lasting sustainable development.</p>
<p>An action plan needs to include clear incentives for manufacturers to provide the spare parts, tools and necessary technical knowledge to allow hospitals to repair their equipment. Also, products should be designed to last in time and be able to be repaired multiple times before they have to be recycled. Thus, design for durability is a key feature of the circular economy.</p>
<p>In addition, rules and regulations related to medical RTR need to ensure that medical equipment is subject to high quality repairs and safety regulations. To this end, a collaboration between manufacturers and hospitals is necessary to ensure that biomedical technicians follow the same standards that manufacturers have adopted.</p>
<p><strong>To Sum Up:</strong></p>
<p>A circular healthcare economy based on medical RTR increases efficiency and offers an alternative to the unsustainable environmental consequences of current practices. An active role of the healthcare system in the ecological transition is most likely to involve a high level of concerted actions among different people and institutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radio-astronomy-history-cosmos-black-hole-planet-universe">How radio astronomy put new eyes on the cosmos</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">One can only imagine what Grote Reber’s neighbors thought when, in 1937, the amateur radio enthusiast erected in his yard a nearly 10-meter-wide shallow bowl of sheet metal, perched atop an adjustable scaffold and topped by an open pyramid of gangly towers. Little could his neighbors have known that they were witnessing the birth of a new way of looking at the cosmos.</p>



<p>Reber was building the world’s first dedicated radio telescope. Unlike traditional telescopes, which use lenses or mirrors to focus visible light, this contraption used metal and circuitry to collect interstellar radio waves, low frequency ripples of electromagnetic radiation. With his homemade device, Reber made the first map of the sky as seen with radio-sensitive eyes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/milky-way-earth">kicked off the field of radio astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>“Radio astronomy is as fundamental to our understanding of the universe as … optical astronomy,” says Karen O’Neil, site director at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. “If we want to understand the universe, we really need to make sure we have as many different types of eyes on the universe as we possibly can.”</p>



<p>When astronomers talk about radio waves from space, they aren’t (necessarily) referring to alien broadcasts. More often, they are interested in low-energy light that can emerge when molecules change up their rotation, for example, or when electrons twirl within a magnetic field. Tuning in to interstellar radio waves for the first time was akin to Galileo pointing a modified spyglass at the stars centuries earlier — we could see things in the sky <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/timeline-seeing-better">we’d never seen before</a>.</p>



<p>Today, radio astronomy is a global enterprise. More than 100 radio telescopes — from spidery antennas hunkered low to the ground to supersized versions of Reber’s dish that span hundreds of meters — dot the globe. These eyes on the sky have been so game-changing that they’ve been at the center of no fewer than three Nobel Prizes.</p>



<p>Not bad for a field that got started by accident.</p>



<p>In the early 1930s, an engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories named Karl Jansky was tracking down sources of radio waves that interfered with wireless communication. He <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/outer-space-radio-hiss">stumbled upon a hiss</a> coming from somewhere in the constellation Sagittarius, in the direction of the center of the galaxy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="447" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg" alt="black and white image of Karl Jansky working on his rotating radio antenna" class="wp-image-3102925" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-583x383.jpg 583w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-283x186.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102925">Karl Jansky, shown here with his rotating radio antenna, stumbled on a radio hiss coming from the direction of the center of the galaxy, marking the beginnings of radio astronomy.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102925">NRAO, AUI, NSF, Jeff Hellerman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The basic discovery that there was radio radiation coming from interstellar space confounded theory,” says astronomer Jay Lockman, also of Green Bank. “There was no known way of getting that.”</p>



<p>Bell Labs moved Jansky on to other, more Earthly pursuits. But Reber, a fan of all things radio, read about Jansky’s discovery and wanted to know more. No one had ever built a radio telescope before, so Reber figured it out himself, basing his design on principles used to focus visible light in optical scopes. He improved upon Jansky’s antenna — a bunch of metal tubes held up by a pivoting wooden trestle — and fashioned a parabolic metal dish for focusing incoming radio waves to a point, where an amplifier boosted the feeble signal. The whole contraption sat atop a tilting wooden base that let him scan the sky by swinging the telescope up and down. The same basic design is used today for radio telescopes around the world.</p>



<p>For nearly a decade — thanks partly to the Great Depression and World War II — Reber was largely alone. The field didn’t flourish until after the war, with a crop of scientists brimming with new radio expertise from designing radar systems. Surprises have been coming ever since.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="806" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber.jpg" alt="black and white image of first radio telescope" class="wp-image-3102930" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber-323x383.jpg 323w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber-380x450.jpg 380w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber-157x186.jpg 157w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber-489x580.jpg 489w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_reber-655x776.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102930">Grote Reber erected the world’s first dedicated radio telescope – shown here – in his yard in Wheaton, Ill.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102930">GBO, NSF, AUI</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“The discovery of interstellar molecules, that’s a big one,” says Lisa Young, an astronomer at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. Radio telescopes are well suited to peering into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/final-chemistry-frontier">the dense, cold clouds where molecules reside</a> and sensing radiation emitted when they lose rotational energy. Today, the list of identified interstellar molecules includes many complex organics, including some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/interstellar-chemical-resembles-building-blocks-life">thought to be precursors for life</a>.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes also turned up objects previously unimagined. Quasars, the blazing cores of remote galaxies powered by behemoth black holes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quasars-are-crazy">first showed up</a> in detailed radio maps from the late 1950s. Pulsars, the ultradense spinning cores of dead stars, made themselves known in 1967 when Jocelyn Bell Burnell noticed that the radio antenna array she helped build was picking up a steady beep … beep … beep from deep space every 1.3 seconds. (She was passed over when the 1974 Nobel Prize in physics honored this discovery — her adviser got the recognition. But an accolade came in 2018, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jocelyn-bell-burnell-physics-prize-pulsar-discovery-interview">she was awarded a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics</a>.)</p>



<p>Pulsars are “not only interesting for being a discovery in themselves,” Lockman says. They “are being used now to make tests of general relativity and detect gravitational waves.” That’s because anything that nudges a pulsar — say, a passing ripple in spacetime — alters when its ultraprecise radio beats arrive at Earth. In the early 1990s, such timing variations from one pulsar led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radio-pulses-hint-unseen-planets">the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the solar system</a>.</p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">brief blasts of radio energy primarily from other galaxies</a> have captured astronomers’ attention. Discovered in 2007, the causes of these “fast radio bursts” are still unknown. But they are already useful probes of the stuff between galaxies. The light from these eruptions encodes signatures of the atoms encountered while en route to Earth, allowing astronomers to track down <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts">lots of matter they thought should be out in the cosmos</a> but hadn’t found yet. “That was the thing that allowed us to weigh the universe and understand where the missing matter is,” says Dan Werthimer, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>





<p>And it was a radio antenna that, in 1964, gave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/remnants-primeval-fireball-believed-aglow">the biggest boost to the then-fledgling Big Bang theory</a>. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, engineers at Bell Labs, were stymied by a persistent hiss in the house-sized, horn-like antenna they were repurposing for radio astronomy. The culprit was radiation that permeates all of space, left behind from a time when the universe was much hotter and denser than it is today. This “cosmic microwave background,” named for the relatively high frequencies at which it is strongest, is still the clearest window that astronomers have into the very early universe.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes have another superpower. Multiple radio dishes linked together across continents can act as one enormous observatory, with the ability to see details much finer than any of those dishes acting alone. Building a radio eye as wide as the planet — the Event Horizon Telescope — led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the first picture of a black hole</a>.</p>

<p>“Not that anybody needed proof of the existence [of black holes],” Young says, “but there’s something so marvelous about actually being able to see it.”</p>



<p>The list of discoveries goes on: Galaxies from the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-active-galaxies-early-universe-may-have-finally-been-found">that are completely shrouded in dust and so emit no starlight</a> still glow bright in radio images. Rings of gas and dust encircling young stars are providing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protoplanetary-gas-disks-stars-gaps-newborn-planets">details about planet formation</a>. Intel on asteroids and planets in our solar system can be gleaned <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/liquid-center-mercury-has-molten-core-radar-reveals">by bouncing radio waves off their surfaces</a>.</p>



<p>And, of course, there’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">the search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>, or SETI. “Radio is probably the most likely place where we will answer the question: ‘Are we alone?’” Werthimer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="493" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc.jpg" alt="red planet-forming disk around HL Tauri" class="wp-image-3102929" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-528x383.jpg 528w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-621x450.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-257x186.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102929">The ALMA radio telescope network in the Atacama Desert in Chile captured this image of what appears to be a planet-forming disk around the young star HL Tauri.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102929">ESO, NAOJ, NRAO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That sentiment goes back more than a century. In 1899, inventor Nikola Tesla picked up radio signals that he thought were coming from folks on another planet. And for 36 hours in August 1924, the United States ordered all radio transmitters silent for five minutes every hour to listen for transmissions from Mars as Earth lapped the Red Planet at a relatively close distance. The field got a more official kickoff in 1960 when astronomer Frank Drake pointed Green Bank’s original radio telescope at the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, just in case anyone there was broadcasting.</p>



<p>While SETI has had its ups and downs, “there’s kind of a renaissance,” Werthimer says. “There’s a lot of new, young people going into SETI … and there’s new money.” In 2015, entrepreneur Yuri Milner <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-et-gets-financial-boost">pledged $100 million over 10 years</a> to the search for other residents of our universe.</p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-loss-big-deal-astronomy-video">collapse of the giant Arecibo Observatory in 2020</a> — at 305 meters across, it was the largest single dish radio telescope for most of its lifetime — was tragic and unexpected, radio astronomers have new facilities in the works. <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/">The Square Kilometer Array</a>, which will link up small radio dishes and antennas across Australia and South Africa when complete in the late 2020s, will probe the acceleration of the universe’s expansion, seek out signs of life and explore conditions from cosmic dawn. “We’ll see the signatures of the first structures in the universe forming the first galaxies and stars,” Werthimer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="399" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg" alt="rows of radio telescopes at the Square Kilometer Array" class="wp-image-3102927" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-653x383.jpg 653w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-317x186.jpg 317w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102927">The Square Kilometer Array will connect radio dishes and antennas across South Africa and Australia, offering an unprecedented look at the universe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102927">SKA Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But if the history of radio astronomy is any guide, the most remarkable discoveries yet to come will be the things no one has thought to look for. So much about the field is marked by serendipity, Werthimer notes. Even radio astronomy as a field started serendipitously. “If you just build something to look at some place that nobody’s looked before,” he says, “you&#8217;ll make interesting discoveries.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">Streetlights, especially super bright LEDs, may harm insect populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Moths flock to streetlights, bewitched by their luminous brilliance. But bathing in brightness all night seems to have consequences for the grounded forms of these fliers. Illuminated stretches of English roads housed up to <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/35/eabi8322/tab-article-info">52 percent fewer moth caterpillars</a> than adjacent dark patches, researchers report August 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Streetlights could be contributing to declining insect populations in developed areas, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Artificial light is generally not good for nocturnal insects. Recent work hints the glow can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nighttime-light-pollution-sabotages-sex-pheromones-moths">mess with mating</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-foil-plant-insect-hookups-and-not-just-night">disrupt pollination</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/15; SN: 8/2/17</em>). But whether night lights contribute to population decline is understudied, says Douglas Boyes, an entomologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boyes and colleagues compared 27 stretches of road that appeared identical except some parts were lit at night and others remained dark. Instead of looking at moth adults that can fly kilometers during their lives, the researchers counted caterpillars, which traverse just meters. At night, the team knocked dozens of species from roadside hedgerows or swept up larvae from grasses, catching nearly 2,500 caterpillars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hedgerows under bright LED lights contained 52 percent fewer caterpillars than dark sections, while areas under duller sodium lamps housed 41 percent fewer. On grassy sections, LED lights cut the population by 33 percent, while sodium lamps had little effect. LED lamps emit a broader spectrum of light than other lamps, which may explain their heightened influence. Caterpillars were fatter in lit sections, which probably indicates abnormal development, Boyes says, but how exactly LED light harms caterpillars remains unclear.</p>



<p>The United Kingdom’s moth population has shrunk by a third in 50 years, but since less than 3 percent of the country lies under strong illumination from streetlights, habitat loss and climate change are more likely to blame than the lights, Boyes says. Still, the work highlights a relatively easy way to give some insects a break, he says. Just turn down the lights, or place filters on LEDs that narrow the spectra of light they shine down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">These charts show that COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the coronavirus continues to surge across the United States, hospitals are again filling up with ill COVID-19 patients. And the vast majority of those patients are unvaccinated, as two new charts help make exceedingly clear.</p>



<p>One of those charts shows that from January 24 to July 24, vaccinated individuals were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.21262356v1.full.pdf">much lower cumulative rate than unvaccinated individuals</a>. And the difference in rates between the two groups has only grown over time. By late July, a total of about 26 adults per 100,000 vaccinated people had been hospitalized for COVID-19. That’s compared with about 431 hospitalized people for every 100,000 unvaccinated individuals — a rate roughly 17 times as high as for those who were vaccinated. The data&nbsp;come from 13 states, including California, Georgia and Utah.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Growing divide<em>  </em></h3>



<p>The gap in the cumulative hospitalization rates among unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults 18 years and older has been growing since COVID-19 vaccines started rolling out in late 2020. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>That trend held when the researchers charted hospitalization rates on a weekly basis too. From January to July, weekly hospitalization rates among unvaccinated people were six to 31 times as high as those in vaccinated people, the researchers report August 29 at medRxiv.org.</p>



<p>The accumulation of hospitalizations in each group over time, which that first chart shows, illustrates the risk of developing severe COVID-19 overall. And its message is clear: If you’re vaccinated during this pandemic, your risk of hospitalization is much, much lower than if you’re not vaccinated. The weekly rate, on the other hand, is a bit like the speedometer on a car — providing a glimpse of what&#8217;s happening week by week as the coronavirus spreads. Its message is also clear: The risk of a vaccinated person becoming hospitalized remains low at any given time, while the risk for unvaccinated people can fluctuate, probably as a result of community transmission.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Weekly trends </h3>



<p>Since January, weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rates have fluctuated in unvaccinated people but have been consistently higher than in vaccinated people. For instance, as the delta variant became the dominant variant in June, hospitalizations of unvaccinated adults 18 years and older spiked while rates for vaccinated remained steady and low. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>The findings, along with other recent research out of Los Angeles County, “remind us that if you are not yet vaccinated, you are among those highest at risk,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said August 24 in a White House news briefing. “Please do not underestimate the risk of serious consequences of this virus.”</p>



<p>As of August 26, more than <a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization">100,000 people are hospitalized for COVID-19</a> in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — a level not seen since January amid the winter surge. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate study, described August 24 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, </em>that focused on Los Angeles County also showed that while COVID-19 vaccines don’t always stop infections, the shots still prevent people from landing in the hospital. That’s even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant, which has raised concerns among public health officials because some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">vaccinated people who get infected can transmit the coronavirus</a> to others (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 25, when the delta variant was prevalent in the county, unvaccinated people were nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e5.htm?s_cid=mm7034e5_w">30 times as likely to be hospitalized</a> as vaccinated people, the researchers found. Only one vaccinated person for every 100,000 people was hospitalized for COVID-19. Among unvaccinated people, there were around 29 hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals. In that same study, unvaccinated people were five times as likely to be infected as vaccinated people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While the vaccines don’t protect against infection as well as they do against severe disease, the shots are keeping people off ventilators and from dying, Kathryn Edwards, an infectious disease pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said August 26 in a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “We cannot lose the forest for the trees.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780197555767">On the Fringe</a><br><em>Michael D. Gordin</em><br><em>Oxford Univ., $18.95</em></p>



<p>There is no such thing as pseudoscience, and Michael Gordin has written a book about it.</p>



<p>In <em>On the Fringe</em>, Gordin, a historian at Princeton University, does not deny that there are endeavors afoot in the world that are labeled pseudoscience. Rather he shows that the term has no precise meaning, and that there is no unambiguous, universal test for delineating true science from the false versions on its fringe.</p>





<p>Many well-known examples of pseudoscience, he notes, were once mainstream scientific disciplines. Astrology, for instance, was for centuries respected or practiced by the most prominent scientific thinkers of their time.</p>



<p>Astrology’s time is long past, of course. So Gordin refers to it, and alchemy, and eugenics, as vestigial sciences — once regarded as totally scientific, but cast aside into the pseudoscience realm by the advance of knowledge.</p>



<p>Other pseudosciences arise having never attained respectable scientific status. Some are ideologically driven “hyperpoliticized” sciences; some, like creationism, are “counterestablishment” ventures that feign scientific trappings; others are wishful thinking delusions like extrasensory perception.</p>





<p>Advocates for many such pseudosciences seek legitimacy by imitating the scientific process — holding conferences, publishing journals and claiming to cite evidence (though presented in ways riddled with logical fallacies).</p>



<p>The problem is, “real” science also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">sometimes suffers from errors of rigor and logic</a>, as recent concerns about reproducing experimental results have demonstrated (<em>SN: 3/27/10, p. 26</em>). So drawing a sharp line between real and pseudo remains a difficult task.</p>



<p>Gordin provides neat, quick summaries of all these issues in his brief but thoughtful and enjoyable book. Most valuable of all is his first chapter, in which he demolishes the notion that philosopher Karl Popper’s “falsifiability” criterion allows a clear demarcation between science and non- (or pseudo-) science. <em>Falsifiable</em>, Gordin points out, is undefinable. If nothing else, every working scientist (and science journalist) should read this chapter to learn that the refrain “if it’s not falsifiable, it’s not science” is philosophically unsound gibberish, a sign of a weak argument.</p>



<p>Still, some pseudoscience is clearly out of bounds. And some would say the scientific revolution of the 17th century established new rules that filtered bad science from the good. But it still took a while for modern science to do away with astrology and alchemy. Later, eugenics and even ESP were for a time taken seriously by some “modern” scientists. Sometimes it just takes time to identify bad science and discard it.</p>



<p>As Gordin writes, science is not a “fixed repository of information,” but a dynamic enterprise focused to a large extent on “refuting or revising past knowledge.” So in a sense the scientific revolution did not really render the science of the ancient Greeks or Middle Ages pseudoscience, but rather just revealed it to be primitive science, awaiting better methods, technologies and insights. As science historian Steven Shapin opened his 1996 book on that topic, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">New ideas on what makes a planet habitable could reshape the search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When considering where to look for extraterrestrial life, astronomers have mostly stuck with what’s familiar. The best candidates for habitable planets are considered the ones most like Earth: small, rocky, with breathable atmospheres and a clement amount of warmth from their stars.</p>



<p>But as more planets outside the solar system have been discovered, astronomers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">debated the usefulness of this definition</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>). Some planets in the so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are right for liquid water, are probably not good for life at all. Others outside that designated area might be perfectly comfortable.</p>



<p>Now, two studies propose revising the concept of “habitable zone” to account for more of the planets that astronomers may encounter in the cosmos. One new definition brings more planets into the habitable fold; the other nudges some out.</p>



<p>“Both papers focus on questioning the classical idea of the habitable zone,” says astronomer Noah Tuchow of Penn State University. “We should extend the range of places that we look, so we don’t miss habitable planets.”</p>





<p>Some overlooked planets could be much bigger than Earth, and potentially receive no starlight at all. Astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge and colleagues propose a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfd9c">new category of possibly habitable planet</a> that could be found at almost any distance from any kind of star.</p>



<p>These hypothetical planets have a global liquid-water ocean nestled under a thick <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-hydrogen-rich-atmosphere-alien-life">hydrogen-rich atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/20</em>). Madhusudhan calls them “Hycean” planets, for “hydrogen” and “ocean.” They could be up to 2.6 times the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive, Madhusudhan and colleagues report August 25 in the<em> Astrophysical Journal. </em>That thick atmosphere could keep temperatures right for liquid water even with minimal input from a star, while the ocean could protect anything living from crushing atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>“We want to expand beyond our fixated paradigm so far on Earthlike planets,” Madhusudhan says. “Everything we’ve learned about exoplanets so far is extremely diverse. Why restrict ourselves when it comes to life?”</p>



<p>In the search for alien life, Hycean planets would have several advantages over rocky planets in the habitable zone, the team says. Though it’s difficult to tell which worlds definitely have oceans and hydrogen atmospheres, there are many more known exoplanets in the mass and temperature ranges of Hycean planets than there are Earthlike planets. So the odds are good, Madhusudhan says.</p>



<p>And because they are generally larger and have more extended atmospheres than rocky planets, Hycean planets are easier to probe for biosignatures, molecular signs of life. Detectable biosignatures on Hycean planets could include rare molecules associated with life on Earth like dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide. These tend to be too low in concentration to detect in thin Earthlike atmospheres, but thicker Hycean atmospheres would show them more readily.</p>



<p>Best of all, existing or planned telescopes could detect those molecules within a few years, if they’re there. Madhusudhan already has plans to use NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch later this year, to observe the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">water-rich planet K2 18b</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>That planet’s habitability was debated when it was reported in 2019. Madhusudhan says 20 hours of observations with JWST should solve the debate.</p>



<p>“Best-case scenario, we’ll detect life on K2 18b,” he says, though “I’m not holding my breath over it.”</p>



<p>Astronomer Laura Kreidberg of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, thinks it probably won’t be that easy. Planets in the Hycean size range tend to have cloudy or hazy atmospheres, making biosignatures more difficult to pick up.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if Hycean planets actually exist in nature. “It is a really fun idea,” she says. “But is it just a fun idea, or does it match up with reality? I think we absolutely don’t know yet.”</p>



<p>Rather than inventing a new way to bring exoplanets into the habitable family, Tuchow and fellow Penn State astronomer Jason Wright are kicking some apparently habitable planets out. The pair realized that the region of clement temperatures around a star changes as the star evolves and changes brightness.</p>



<p>Some planets are born in the habitable zone and stay there their entire lives. But some, possibly most, are born outside their star’s habitable zone and enter it later, as the star ages. In the August <em>Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</em>, Tuchow and Wright suggest calling those worlds “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ac1ea2">belatedly habitable planets</a>.”</p>



<p>When astronomers point their telescopes at a given star, the scientists are seeing only a snapshot of the star’s habitable zone, the pair say. “If you just look at a planet in the habitable zone in the present day, you have no idea how long it’s been there,” Tuchow says. It’s an open question whether planets that enter the habitable zone later in life can ever become habitable, he explains. If the planet started out too close to the star, it could have lost all its water to a greenhouse effect, like Venus did. Moving Venus to the position of Earth won’t give it its water back.</p>



<p>On the other end, a planet that was born farther from its star could be entirely covered in glaciers, which reflect sunlight. They may never melt, even when their stars brighten. Worse, their water could go straight from frozen to evaporated, a process known as sublimation. That scenario would leave the planet no time with even a cozy wet puddle for life to get started in.</p>



<p>These planets are “still in the habitable zone,” Tuchow says. “But it adds questions about whether or not being in the habitable zone actually means habitable.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/664405518/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4145243-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>On 18 March 2020, schools in Finland closed. On 14 May 2020, they reopened successfully. Why was Finland successful in transitioning to distance education and then back to face-to-face learning and teaching?</p><p>There is an a priori answer. Finns have a view of education and learning that often contradicts common wisdom (such as worrying less about the standardized performance of children and teachers&#8217; accountability) to truly serve the wellbeing of children by empowering the highly selective and trained teacher force with trust.</p><p>Finns are passionate about face-to-face education even in the age of technology-driven educational services. They have invested heavily in new or refurbished twenty-first century superschools, which create superb and highly resourced teaching and learning environments that facilitate the face-to-face and digital interactions between teachers and students. Together with a serendipitous policy mix of national, local, and school decisions, the school is no longer only a place to teach and learn subjects but also a phenomenon where the whole learning experience and children&#8217;s growth occur. They put a lot of effort into making sure that the children feel safe under a relaxed culture of interaction between students and teachers.</p><p>The Finns have invested in two structural foundations to facilitate the pedagogic interaction: a powerful teaching force and a technological infrastructure (sound broadband internet access and educational tools so that teachers can navigate different pedagogic proposals and environments). They have reduced the number of smaller, less well-resourced schools, and instead, they have established large superschools to house more resources for many students. Fewer, well-resourced schools, rather than many low-resourced schools, is one of their key ideas.</p><p>Digitalization in schools followed digitalization in life—but schools went one step further. More screen time is not learning. Therefore, Finnish schools decided to provide digital access for everyone and train teachers and students with skills on how to use this technology for learning and wellbeing. They don&#8217;t force digitalization but make sure that if teachers and students want to explore digital means, all the schools are ready for them.</p><p>Since collaboration among all school agents (teachers, students, and parents) has always been essential in the Finnish model of education, and since the society and parents have a high value of education (for example, the teaching profession is one of the most highly demanded fields of university studies by high school students), it was not very difficult for schools and teachers to communicate with parents and students during the pandemic.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated the turn-of-the-century trends: more digitalization, flexible technology, teamwork, and a focus on the wellbeing of students and teachers. So, what should we expect in the future? In the short term, new spaces for outdoor activities, more digital skills, more constant formative evaluations for students, and more strategic planning for future crises in the long term.</p><p>Here are the key learnings shared by Finnish teachers, experts, and principals during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>The need to keep the information and communication channels open and frequent among all people.</li><li>The need to bring the newly acquired skills into daily lives, perhaps with remote sessions once a week or per school term, as modern technology companies do.</li><li>The knowledge that we are living, in part, the normality of the future.</li><li>The pandemic is a phenomenon with solid consequences: loneliness kills.</li><li>A school is a place to learn academic skills and, perhaps more importantly, grow and share with others. A school is a place where one can safely fail and recover.</li><li>Teachers took a tremendous digital leap.</li><li>The majority opinion seems to be that closing schools hurt students.</li><li>Face-to-face teaching and learning is the correct form of education and deep learning.</li><li>Although the pandemic has driven the digital leap at all educational levels, the coronavirus will not change school curricula. The issue is how to approach rather than change the school curricula.</li><li>Education has been, and continues to be, the number one priority in Finland.</li><li>When everyone (students, parents, teachers, community) works together, we can get the best results.</li><li>Lifelong learning is not just a phrase; it is a necessity for every one of us.</li></ul><p>Face-to-face education is so important to achieve. Digitalization is an instrument, a means to an end. Digital technology complements the work of teachers. The dual vision of digital preparedness and children&#8217;s wellbeing, backed by the already-in-place teachers&#8217; pedagogic command, facilitated the successful transition back and forth between distance and face-to-face learning during the 2020-2021 coronavirus crisis.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/664405518/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/664405518/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2fpexels-julia-m-cameron-4145243-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/science-denial-why-it-happens-and-5-things-you-can-do-about-it/">Science denial: why it happens and 5 things you can do about&#xA0;it</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/what-does-the-history-of-victory-day-tell-us-about-russias-national-identity/">What does the history of Victory Day tell us about Russia&#8217;s national identity?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/shape-and-societal-recovery-from-crises/">SHAPE and societal recovery from crises</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p><strong>The shrinking mass of Pluto</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shrinking-mass-pluto">Science News</a></em>, August 28, 1971</p>



<p>Pluto was the last of the planets to be discovered (in 1930). If astronomers continue to make it lighter, it may be the first to disappear.… [The latest measurement] brings Pluto down to 0.11 of Earth’s mass, less than an eighth of its former self.… The wide discrepancies among the figures presented for the mass of Pluto illustrate the particular difficulties of measuring its mass.… If a planet has satellites, its mass can be determined from studying their motions.… But Pluto has no known satellites.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon-believed-found-pluto">discovery of Pluto’s moon Charon</a> in 1978 (<em>SN: 7/15/78, p. 36</em>) finally allowed astronomers to accurately calculate the planet’s mass: about 0.2 percent of Earth’s mass. Decades after scientists resolved Pluto’s heft, the planet received arguably the greatest demotion of all — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">a downgrade to dwarf planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/06, p. 149</em>). Some astronomers have since proposed alternate definitions for the term “planet” that, if widely adopted, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">restore Pluto to its former rank</a>.</p>

                <p>A coral the size of a carousel is the widest known in the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>Found just off the coast of Goolboodi Island in Northeast Australia, this reef-building <em>Porites</em> measures 10.4 meters in diameter — earning it the nickname Muga dhambi, or “big coral,” from the Indigenous custodians of the island, the Manbarra people.</p>



<p>In addition to its record-setting width, Muga dhambi stands a little over 5 meters tall, making it the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94818-w">sixth tallest coral in the Great Barrier Reef</a>, researchers report August 19 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a stand-alone coral … and we don&#8217;t see many that size,” says marine scientist Nathan Cook of Reef Ecologic, a climate and environmental consulting firm in Townsville, Australia.</p>



<p>Based on Muga dhambi’s height and estimated growth rate, Cook and colleagues calculate that the creamy brown, boulderlike coral is about 421 to 438 years old. It predates European colonization of Australia and has survived as many as 80 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-powerful-pacific-cyclones-may-fuel-global-warming">cyclones</a> (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>) and 99 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">coral bleaching events</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/21</em>), the team says.</p>



<p>Many of the recent stories about corals in the Great Barrier Reef read like obituaries, Cook says. “Knowing that these things [like Muga dhambi] exist, and have persisted for a long time, helps to provide a renewed sense of hope for the future.”</p>

                <p class="">A brain aneurysm is a weakened area in the lining of a blood vessel in the brain where blood accumulates, causing a bulging of the blood vessel wall. Most brain aneurysms do not cause any symptoms, but a ruptured aneurysm can lead to bleeding into the area surrounding the brain—a dangerous condition known as subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this video, I discuss the characteristics, formation, rupture, and treatment of brain aneurysms.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We’re famously bad at spotting lies (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/05/14/skilled-liars-make-great-lie-detectors/">well, most of us are; skilled liars are better</a>). That doesn’t stop us thinking we know when someone’s spinning us a line, of course. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797621994770">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> reveals that we take an angry denial to be a sign that the accused is lying. And yet, Katherine A. DeCelles at the University of Toronto and colleagues also report, anger in response to a false accusation is in fact a sign of <em>innocence</em>.</p>



<span id="more-43365"></span>



<p>In initial studies on more than 4,000 online participants, the team established that anger is consistently taken as a sign of guilt. This held across a variety of contexts, including a fictional courtroom situation with an accusation of armed robbery, and also scenarios involving accusations of infidelity and theft. In each case, the participants read about how the confronted individuals reacted, and made judgments about their guilt. Fictional people who’d made angry denials were taken to be guiltier than those who’d made &#8220;irritated&#8221; denials (characterised by a raised voice and less vehement protests), and they were in turn taken to be guiltier than those who’d calmly professed their innocence.</p>



<p>Perhaps, though, professionals who often have to make guilt judgements in their jobs react differently? A fresh study on 136 such people, including fraud investigators, police and lawyers, found this not to be the case. These participants judged that an employee described as having reacted angrily to an accusation of theft was guiltier than one who reacted calmly. In fact, the &#8220;angry&#8221; employee was considered just as guilty as a &#8220;silent&#8221; employee who’d refused to respond when confronted.</p>



<p>If anger actually is a sign of guilt then these results would suggest a useful clue to truthfulness, of course. However, in a subsequent study, participants who were asked to reflect on situations in their own lives reported feeling and also displaying more anger when they had been falsely vs justly accused of a misdeed. It didn’t matter whether the deed was trivial (taking a room-mate’s food, for example) or serious — cheating on a spouse, say, or workplace misconduct.</p>



<p>In a final study, participants took part in an in-person lab-based experiment in which some were falsely accused of making mistakes on a text-based task; this group reported feeling angrier than those who were correctly accused of making errors.</p>



<p>Overall, then, as the researchers write, anger does seem to be used as invalid cue of guilt while being a valid cue of innocence.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand what is — and isn’t — a genuine sign of innocence vs guilt in all kinds of situations, of course. But there are a few reasons to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from this new work. For example: the &#8220;angry&#8221; denials that the participants read in the initial experiments were pretty angry, featuring explicit language and expressing outrage. Their anger level was a lot higher than that reported by participants in the latter studies in response to being falsely accused themselves. Even those who’d reflected on being falsely accused of a serious transgression did not report such extreme anger. <em>Hamlet</em> springs to mind, and Queen Gertrude’s classic line: “The lady doth protest too much…” An emotional over-reaction that doesn’t match the scale of an accusation might yet be a sign of guilt; at least, this paper doesn’t show that it isn’t.</p>



<p>However, it’s true that people who reacted with irritation were taken to be guiltier than those who responded calmly. So until more work is done in this area, it seems worth at least trying not to use someone’s anger level in response to an accusation as a sign of guilt.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration with <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a>, a new company that is introducing &#8220;Smart Citations.&#8221; These new citations not only show how many times an article has been cited, but <i>how</i> it has been cited by other publications. This is done by showing the citation context from the citing article, the section of the paper the citation appears in, and whether the citing paper provides supporting or contrasting evidence to the cited claim. These Smart Citations have already been integrated by various publishers and preprint servers to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, arXiv readers can now easily see how millions of preprints have been cited by opening the corresponding scite report. Once on the report, users can quickly read citation statements from each citing paper to see how an article and its findings have been discussed or used, find co-citations, filter by citation types (supporting, contrasting, and mentioning), and more.</p>
<p>To build the tool, scite has processed millions of full-text articles in order to extract and analyze citation statements. To date, scite has analyzed over 26M full-text articles and extracted and analyzed nearly 900M citation statements across a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Josh Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of scite says, &#8220;We’re happy to be working in collaboration with arXiv to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings. arXiv hosts some of the world’s most important research and we are happy to contribute to making that researcher easier to interpret and evaluate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to be working with scite to help provide more context to how articles have been received in the literature,&#8221; said Eleonora Presani. Presani continued, &#8220;scite makes it easy to understand and quickly see how an article has been cited. By opening this information up so that it is easily accessible and digestible we think that will improve research itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transgender-youth-mental-health-gender-affirming-care-laws">Gender-affirming care improves mental health for transgender youth</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Daniel’s birth certificate is marked “female,” but Daniel is nonbinary — not exclusively male nor female. “I’m masculine leaning,” says the 18-year-old.</p>



<p>The disconnect between Daniel’s gender identity and physical appearance, which was apparent to them around age 4, became unbearable during puberty. “I hated showers because I didn’t like looking at my body,” Daniel says. “I just felt really uncomfortable with the idea of being female.” At 13, Daniel came out to their mother as transgender, someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>



<p>About a month after coming out, Daniel started seeing a therapist who specialized in gender identity. A year later they were referred to an endocrinologist, who prescribed the sex hormone testosterone. For Daniel, the most important effect was a deeper voice. “My biggest problem with getting misgendered was that my voice was really high,” Daniel says.</p>



<p>Before starting hormone therapy, Daniel considered suicide. With masculinizing hormones, they say they’re happier with life. “I definitely feel more like myself. Like I was just existing before, but now I’m living, now that I’m open to everyone about who I am, and most importantly I’m open to myself,” says Daniel, whose last name is being withheld for medical privacy. “Starting testosterone, for me, saved my life.”</p>





<p>Daniel’s hormone therapy is just one method that doctors use to bring a person’s body into alignment with their gender identity, an approach known as gender-affirming health care. This kind of care looks different for people of different ages. For young children, it is limited to allowing them to socially express their gender, with perhaps a name and pronoun change. Adolescents may take medications to delay puberty, followed by gender-affirming hormones and possibly surgery. While researchers are still investigating potential risks, existing evidence suggests that these treatments could have life-saving mental health benefits.</p>



<p>Over the last 20 years or so, gender-affirming treatment has become the standard of care for transgender people in the United States. That change has followed increasing recognition in the medical community that being transgender is a normal example of human diversity and not a mental disorder. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm">1.8 percent of American high schoolers are transgender</a>, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Despite findings from the United States and Europe that show the positive mental health effects of gender-affirming care, a recent groundswell of state legislation has sought to curb access to gender-affirming health care for those who want it. In April, Arkansas became the first state to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors. Similar bills have been proposed in more than a dozen other states. Although several of those proposals failed — and a federal judge blocked the Arkansas law in July — they may still exact a mental health toll on many transgender youth, experts say.</p>



<p>“Even if the bills don’t pass, even if they die in committee, the damage is being done,” says Jason Klein, a pediatric endocrinologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. “Many people across this country are already going to be hurt just by the ideas being put out by these bills.”</p>

<p>Proponents of health care restrictions for transgender youth say they want to protect children from life-altering procedures they may later regret, as well as medical risks, which may include impacts on fertility and bone health. But the <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-speaks-out-against-bills-harming-transgender-youth/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and the <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2021/endocrine-society-condemns-efforts-to-block-access-to-medical-care-for-transgender-youth">Endocrine Society</a> have endorsed gender-affirming care, arguing that the restrictions would endanger a population already at severe risk of depression and self-harm.</p>



<p>Transgender youth are three to four times as likely as their peers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/transgender-children-are-greater-risk-mental-health-problems">to have depression or anxiety</a> (<em>SN Online: 3/1/17</em>). Among 13,600 transgender and nonbinary youth who participated in a national survey in 2020, 52 percent had considered suicide in the previous year, and 21 percent had attempted it.</p>



<p>Gender-affirming health care could improve those alarming statistics across age groups, says Jack Turban, a child and adolescent psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine. “All existing research suggests that gender-affirming medical interventions improve the mental health of transgender youth.”</p>



<h4>Transitioning in childhood</h4>



<p>For children who haven’t yet started puberty, gender-affirming health care involves no medical treatments. It entails parents and doctors supporting a child through a social transition. This may mean calling the child by a new name, using the pronouns that fit their gender identity and allowing the child to dress or wear their hair however feels most authentic to them.</p>



<p>Mental health care professionals can help families through this process. “Sometimes, the kids need more conversation and time to think about their gender identity and their goals for themselves,” Klein says. “Sometimes, the parents need that — the kids are very solid and steady and know exactly who they are, and the parents might need some time to kind of adjust.”</p>

<p>Being supported through a social transition appears to boost young people’s mental health. Levels of depression and self-worth reported by more than 100 socially transitioned transgender children from across the United States and Canada were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856716319414#!">about the same as for their nontransgender, or cisgender, siblings and peers</a>, researchers reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em>. Transgender kids who have not socially transitioned, on the other hand, have historically shown high levels of depression.</p>



<p>Opponents of gender-affirming health care have cited studies suggesting that as many as 80 percent of people who identify as transgender in early childhood will not continue to do so when they grow up. But others have pointed out that those studies included many children who may have been considered transgender based on outdated and overly broad criteria, thus skewing the results. Researchers are still investigating how gender identity evolves with age.</p>



<p>“We have to be honest. We don’t know so much about it,” says Annelou de Vries, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Thus, nonpermanent gender-affirming treatment options may allow children time to safely explore their identity as they approach adolescence, proponents say.</p>



<h4>Pausing puberty</h4>



<p>At the start of puberty, children who are transgender or questioning their gender identity may begin taking medications that suppress the natural release of estrogen and testosterone, sex hormones that cause the body to change. Such puberty blockers can be taken through an injection once a month or every few months, or through a small implant inserted in the upper arm and replaced annually.</p>



<p>“These medications are fully reversible,” says Russell Toomey, a family studies and human development researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson. When someone stops taking them, the body picks up where it left off and proceeds through puberty.</p>



<p>Delaying puberty allows transgender children to go through their early teenage years without experiencing potentially distressing body changes not aligned with their gender identity, Toomey says. For adolescents who later receive hormones, puberty blockers can limit the development of physical features such as breasts that would require surgery to change later.</p>



<p>Puberty blockers are among the gender-affirming treatments forbidden by the latest bills. But these medications are not new and are not just for transgender youth. They have been used for decades to treat children who start showing signs of puberty before age 8 or 9, a condition known as precocious puberty. For transgender youth, these time-tested medications can be a lifeline. Transgender adolescents who had access to puberty blockers <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/2/e20191725?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=3&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token">were 70 percent less likely to consider suicide</a> than those who could not get the medications, according to a 2020 study in <em>Pediatrics</em>. Of the more than 20,000 U.S. transgender adults surveyed, nearly 17 percent had wanted puberty blockers while growing up, but just 2.5 percent of them received the medications.</p>



<p>Youth who visited a gender identity clinic but hadn’t started treatment had more emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, and suicidal tendencies than their cisgender peers, a study of 1,100 youth in the Netherlands found. In contrast, children receiving puberty blockers at that clinic <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30027-6/fulltext">showed similar or better psychological functioning</a> than cisgender kids, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>

<h3>Closer to OK&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Emotional problems, such as depression or anxiety, that would qualify for mental health care were much more common among transgender teens who had not been treated with puberty blockers than among those who had received those medications, in a study of Dutch youth. Similarly, a higher percentage of transgender teens who had not received puberty blockers expressed suicidal thoughts than trans peers who had received the medications and than cisgender, or nontransgender, teens. </p>



<h6>Differences in mental health among Dutch adolescents</h6>

<p>Daniel wishes they’d had the opportunity to take the medications. “I really do believe if I’d been on [puberty] blockers, things would have been a lot easier for me,” Daniel says. “I would have still struggled, but it would have been easier to handle.”</p>



<p>One possible side effect of puberty blockers is delayed bone development. The medications interrupt the rapid buildup in bone density that generally occurs during puberty, potentially leading to weaker bones in adulthood. But long-term data from people treated for precocious puberty suggest that bone development catches up once people stop taking puberty blockers.</p>



<p>Likewise, early data on transgender youth indicate that hormone therapy helps bone growth catch up once teens stop taking puberty blockers, de Vries says. Long-term data don’t yet exist to comprehensively assess the impacts in transgender adults.</p>



<p>To be safe, Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who practices pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, gives special instructions to her patients starting puberty blockers. “We have them take vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and we stress the importance of weight-bearing exercise, which is critical for shoring up bone density.”</p>



<h4>Reversible and not</h4>



<p>Older transgender adolescents can start taking gender-affirming hormones, as Daniel did. A new law in Tennessee bans such hormones for prepubescent children. Yet current medical guidelines do not recommend hormone therapy earlier than about age 14 to 16.</p>



<p>Masculinizing hormone therapy involves taking testosterone to promote changes like voice deepening and facial hair growth, while suppressing menstruation and breast development. Daniel takes testosterone through injections, but the hormone can also be absorbed via skin ointment or a patch.</p>



<p>Feminizing hormone therapy involves taking estrogen through a pill, patch or injection, often with a separate drug to block the body’s natural testosterone. This causes breast development, slows body hair growth and decreases muscle mass. Some effects of hormone therapy, such as facial hair growth, voice deepening and breast development, are permanent, whereas changes in muscle mass and fat distribution are reversible if treatment stops.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Body changes&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Transgender teens about 14 to 16 years old may start taking the masculinizing hormone testosterone or the feminizing hormone estrogen to promote body changes that align with their gender identity.</p>

<p>Twenty-one out of 47 transgender youth in a study at a Missouri children’s hospital expressed suicidal tendencies before starting hormone therapy, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-52280-009">while six did after treatment</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology</em>. Another study at a Texas clinic found that 86 transgender teens on hormone therapy surveyed were <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/4/e20193006">happier with their bodies</a> after about one year of treatment than they were before, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Pediatrics</em>. On a body dissatisfaction scale from 0 (none) to 116 (highest dissatisfaction), teens’ self-reported ratings fell 20 points on average, from about 71 before treatment to about 51 afterward.</p>



<p>While studies like these and many others on the mental health effects of gender-affirming health care are small, taken together they suggest the treatments have a positive impact, even as research efforts continue, says Lauren Beach, a sexual and gender minority health researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “When we consider the incredibly heightened risk that trans youth face for suicide in general, those studies are incredibly compelling.”</p>

<p>Hormone therapy is generally considered safe, but it’s not risk-free. Testosterone and estrogen can both affect fertility, but the effects vary from person to person. People who want to preserve their fertility can freeze eggs or bank sperm before starting gender-affirming hormones — although adolescents who have taken puberty blockers may be less likely than those who have gone through uninterrupted puberty to produce viable eggs or sperm.</p>



<p>“In my experience, most people do not pursue fertility preservation techniques — whether that’s because of their own wants or needs, or because of financial constraints, insurance constraints [or] time constraints,” Klein says. Recent research echoes that observation. At one clinic, of 72 transgender adolescents <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X16309582">counseled on fertility preservation options</a>, just two used them, researchers reported in 2017 in the<em> Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<p>Transgender individuals taking hormones may have a higher-than-before risk of common gender-associated diseases. For example, trans women who take estrogen may be at higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, but not higher risk than other women, says Joshua Safer, who directs the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York City. Trans women who take estrogen also have a slight risk of developing blood clots, but not higher than cisgender women’s risk of developing blood clots from taking estrogen-containing birth control. Transgender men taking testosterone may, like other men, have a higher risk of high cholesterol, Safer says, but existing data cannot say for sure.</p>



<p>Beyond hormone therapy, gender-affirming treatment can involve surgery for some transgender people. Current medical guidelines do not recommend genital surgery for minors, but some adolescents may have masculinizing chest surgery if they experience severe distress or discomfort from unwanted breast development. “This is a major decision that requires careful coordination between a family and their physicians,” Turban says.</p>



<p>Like other aspects of gender-affirming health care, surgery has been shown to improve mental health and quality of life for many. All but one of 58 individuals who had masculinizing chest surgery reported the procedure had an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30286047/">overall positive impact on their lives</a> in a survey published in <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em> in 2019.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Right timing&nbsp;</h3>



<p>For young children, gender-affirming health care is limited to providing support through a change in name and pronouns and clothing style, but no medication. Older adolescents may receive medical treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery, if appropriate.</p>



<h5 class="has-text-align-center">When health care support is considered</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Age (years)</strong></td><td><strong>Options</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&lt;8</td><td>Social transition</td></tr><tr><td>8–14</td><td>Puberty blockers</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;14</td><td>Hormone therapy</td></tr><tr><td>18 (with exceptions)</td><td>Surgery</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
</div>



<h4>Risk of regret</h4>



<p>Medical guidelines recommend that every stage of gender affirmation, from social transition to surgery, involves extensive conversations among children and their parents, physicians and mental health care providers — and informed consent from both adolescents and their parents for any medical procedures. “It’s not that you decide on your 12th birthday where you are when you’re 21,” de Vries says.</p>



<p>Some lawmakers who have pushed bills to ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors have argued that children who receive gender-affirming treatment may regret it when they grow up. Regret is a risk. But current research says that regret following gender-affirming medical and surgical care is rare, Turban says.</p>



<p>One team tracked the development of 55 transgender adults in the Netherlands who received puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones in adolescence, followed by transition-related surgery in early adulthood. After surgery, participants had similar quality of life and happiness as their cisgender peers. All were satisfied with their appearance and <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696">none regretted treatment</a>, according to a 2014 report in <em>Pediatrics</em>. A recent review of more than two dozen studies that include nearly 8,000 transgender patients who had gender-affirming surgeries similarly <a href="https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret_after_gender_affirmation_surgery__a.22.aspx">showed that only about 1 percent regretted treatment</a>, researchers reported in March in<em> Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery-Global Open</em>.</p>



<p>A small percentage of people do choose to discontinue therapy. Among more than 800 adolescents who visited a gender identity clinic in the Netherlands over a 40-year period from 1972 to 2015, 1.9 percent of those who started taking puberty blockers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/">did not proceed with hormone therapy</a>, researchers reported in 2018 in the<em> Journal of Sexual Medicine</em>. And some adults who undergo gender-affirming treatments later decide to return to living as the gender assigned to them at birth, a process called detransitioning.</p>



<p>In a survey of nearly 28,000 transgender adults in the United States, about 2,200 had detransitioned. About 36 percent cited pressure from parents as a reason. Close to 33 percent reported pressure from community and 27 percent said they had trouble getting a job. Just under 11 percent said that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794108/">fluctuations in their gender factored into their detransition</a>, Turban and colleagues report in the June<em> LGBT Health</em>.</p>





<h4>Legal ramifications</h4>



<p>Legislation aiming to restrict gender-affirming health care may have more widespread consequences than preventing minors in some states from receiving treatment. Bills that portray gender-affirming health care as experimental or dangerous may make people who are questioning their gender reluctant to ask for help, Klein says. The bills may also make parents reluctant to seek help for their children even in places where treatment has not been made illegal.</p>



<p>These health care bills are just one aspect of a wave of legislation that some LGBTQ advocates say discriminates against the transgender community. A new law passed in Tennessee, but temporarily halted by a federal judge, requires businesses and government facilities to post signs if they allow transgender people to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. And several states, including Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee, now forbid transgender kids from playing on sports teams that match their gender identity. In late July, a federal judge prevented West Virginia from enforcing its sports ban.</p>

</div>



<p>“We know that a major driver of mental health problems among transgender youth is rejection of their gender identity,” Turban says. “Imagine that you heard powerful politicians pronouncing on the national stage that you’re confused, invalid and dangerous to people in bathrooms and sports leagues. It’s extraordinarily difficult for a child not to be negatively impacted by this rhetoric.”</p>



<p>Research is just emerging on how recent anti-trans legislation may affect transgender youth and their families. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350306037_I_am_afraid_for_those_kids_who_might_find_death_preferable_Parental_Figures'_Reactions_and_Coping_Strategies_to_Bans_on_Gender_Affirming_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse_Youth">Parents of transgender children expressed anxiety about the increased stigma their kids may face</a>, and the potential health impacts of lack of access to gender-affirming care, according to a small online survey published on July 29 in <em>Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity</em>. “I am afraid for those kids who might find death preferable to being forced to go through the bodily changes of puberty for the wrong gender,” says a Texas mother quoted in the study.</p>



<p>Daniel can relate. “It’s frustrating. It angers me,” they say. “But it’s also so confusing, because what is the point of stopping people from being who they are, and doing things that could possibly save their life?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/female-hummingbird-flashy-feathers-males-harassment-attacks">Female hummingbirds may sport flashy feathers to avoid being harassed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some female hummingbirds don flashy feathers to avoid being bothered by other hummingbirds, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Male white-necked jacobin hummingbirds (<em>Florisuga mellivora</em>) have bright blue heads and throats. Females tend to have more drab hues, but some sport the blue coloring too. Appearing fit and fine to impress potential mates can often explain animals’ vibrant colors. But mate choice doesn’t seem to drive these females’ pretty plumage since males don’t appear to prefer the blue females. Instead, bright colors <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01033-2">may help lady birds blend in with the guys, and as a result, feed for longer without harassment</a> from other hummingbirds, researchers report August 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond vying for mates, animals often also compete for territory, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/piggybacking-tadpoles-are-epic-food-beggars">parental attention</a>, social ranks and food (<em>SN: 4/7/16</em>). Mating choices don’t capture all those other interactions and can’t always explain animals’ looks, says Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>To begin investigating why some female jacobins have colorful blue plumage, Falk and colleagues captured and released over 400 of the birds in Gamboa, Panama, using genetics to determine their sex. Most females had drab colors — olive green heads and backs and mottled throats. But nearly 30 percent of females had the shimmery blue noggins that all juveniles have and that are characteristic of adult males.</p>



<p>These birds develop the bright colors in their adolescence, when the birds aren’t yet looking for mates, and for some lady hummers, the colors persist into adulthood when most females drop the bright colors. If these colors in females were driven by mate choice, then this is “the exact opposite of what you would expect,” says Falk, who did the work while at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="294" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of a female bird with normal coloration, a male bird with a blue head and throat and a juvenile bird with a blue head and a peach throat" class="wp-image-3103061" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1-330x143.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103061">Female white-necked jacobins (one illustrated at left) typically have a drab, olive green head and back, paired with a mottled throat. But about 30 percent of females have shiny blue heads and throats and look similar to adult males (center) as well as juveniles of both sexes (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103061">Jillian Ditner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In another experiment, the team set a taxidermy bird that was either a drab female, male or a blue-headed female at each of a pair of hummingbird feeders and compared how live birds reacted to the stuffed dummies. Male birds seemed to prefer drab-looking females, sometimes performing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/costas-hummingbirds-singing-tail-feathers">swooping courtship dives</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). Visitors to the feeders more frequently attempted to mate with green female body doubles than males or females with male-mimicking blue coloration.</p>



<p>White-necked jacobins can also be very aggressive, Falk says. Personality-wise, they’re “like the show-off jocks of the hummingbird world.” At the feeders, preserved females with dull green hues more frequently endured attacks when the feeder next door featured a stuffed male or a blue-colored female. Harassment came not only from jacobins but also from other hummingbird species, suggesting an even greater benefit of bright colors. “It’s really cool that these other species are paying attention to the differences between males and females,” Falk says.</p>





<p>The researchers next implanted tiny tracking tags into wild birds so that the team could tally up birds’ time at feeders that detected the tags. Brightly colored females made more visits to feeders, particularly ones with more sugary nectar, and spent more time there than their muted counterparts, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Being able to fly under the radar and eat in peace more frequently may make the brighter female birds more fit than other females. “Hummingbirds have the highest metabolic rate of any vertebrate on Earth,” says Ola Fincke, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman who was not part of the study. Greater access to better food could make those animals healthier, though the new study looked only at hummingbird feeders, and it’s not clear whether the same trend would apply to foraging from flowers in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though it’s not clear yet what drives such feather finery — whether genetics, hormones or something else — this is an “exciting example” of an evolved trait that helps females blend in with males to avoid harassment, says Sara Lipshutz, an evolutionary biologist at Loyola University Chicago who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>The study also helps put the focus on female birds, which haven’t garnered as much research attention as males. For a long time, Lipshutz says, researchers “have been ignoring females — 50 percent of vertebrate animals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-surfing-shock-wave-physics-particle-laser">Physicists caught protons ‘surfing’ on shock waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons can surf some truly gnarly waves.</p>



<p>A new experiment suggests that the subatomic particles can be accelerated by a process akin to surfers catching waves. The protons get a speed boost not from ocean swells, but from shock waves within plasma, a mixture of electrically charged particles. Such shock waves are sonic boom–like disturbances marked by an abrupt increase in density, temperature and pressure.</p>



<p>The research could help scientists better understand some of the high-energy particles that zip through the cosmos. Shock waves in space are thought to propel charged particles, but it’s still not fully understood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-death-giant-lasers-explosive-mysterious-physics">how particles get their pep</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>In the experiment, which mimicked certain types of cosmic shock waves, protons reached energies up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01325-w">80,000 electron volts</a>, physicists report August 19 in <em>Nature Physics</em>. In space, similar shock waves occur where the outflow of charged particles from the sun meets the Earth’s magnetic field, for example, and also where those particles slow down dramatically as they approach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/voyagers-view">the edge of the solar system</a>, at what’s called the termination shock (<em>SN: 10/4/13</em>).</p>





<p>The scientists used powerful lasers to re-create the physics of such cosmic shock waves on a smaller scale. In the experiment, a laser blast vaporized a target, sending a burst of plasma careening into a cloud of hydrogen gas. As the plasma plowed through the gas, a shock wave formed, and protons from the gas sped up, measurements indicated.</p>



<p>Scientists had predicted that protons could be accelerated by a process called the shock surfing acceleration, which happens in the presence of a magnetic field. A particle is pushed along by the shock wave’s electric field, and the magnetic field helps the particle stay on course. If the particle glides away from the shock wave, the magnetic field twists the particle’s trajectory to return it to the wave, so the proton can surf again.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no such automatic return for human surfers, says Julien Fuchs of CNRS and the Laboratory for the Use of Intense Lasers, in Palaiseau, France. It’s too bad, he muses: “I think they would like that.”</p>



<p>Still, the measurements alone didn’t pinpoint if shock surfing was responsible for the protons’ speedup. “The challenge is always in the interpretation, so what exactly caused that acceleration,” says plasma physicist Frederico Fiuza of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif.,&nbsp;who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>So Fuchs and colleagues created computer simulations of the experiment. Comparing the simulations and the real data suggests that the protons were surfing the shock wave.</p>



<p>“This is definitely an exciting result,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz&nbsp;of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She says she hopes that further research would be able to uncover more direct evidence that doesn’t rely on computer simulations. “It’s very promising for future work.”</p>

<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unparalleled challenge not only to our health systems, but also to our lives as a community. During the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen a lot of misinformation and polarization around topics related to the virus and its spread. In a commendable effort to shed some light on this issue, Escandón from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia, and colleagues present a comprehensive, engaging and well documented review that deconstructs six common COVID-19 false dichotomies: 1) Health and lives vs. economy and livelihoods, 2) Indefinite lockdown vs. unlimited reopening, 3) Symptomatic vs. asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4) Droplet vs. aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 5) Masks for all vs. no masking, and 6) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection vs. no reinfection. As a take-home message, the authors highlight the critical need for meaningful public health communication and science-informed policies that recognize shades of gray, uncertainties, local context, and social determinants of health.</p>

<p>The last report from the United Nations assessing climate change estimates a global average increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. Urgent climate actions are needed and governments should prepare to secure food sources with the ability to thrive under high temperature environments. In their study, Gonzalo and colleagues from Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain focus on one of the most important horticultural crops worldwide, the tomato. The researchers exposed 219 tomato varieties to high temperature stress in controlled greenhouse experiments and measured reproductive traits such as flower and fruit number production to evaluate their heat tolerance. Although extreme high temperatures strongly decrease these traits in most varieties, 15 of them showed significant heat tolerance as well as good agronomic performance in open field cultivation under moderate temperature stress. The study also includes a transcriptomic analysis that offers a wide look into the genetic control of the heat tolerance mechanisms, making it a valuable source for future breeding programs.</p>

<p>Even before COVID-19 severely impaired our social connections, solitary home deaths from preventable causes have been on the rise in recent years, especially in the elderly population. In this article, Dr. Nakazawa and colleagues from University of Tokyo, Japan, present a balanced discussion about how wearable devices offer a promising platform for reducing solitary deaths in socially isolated individuals by swiftly connecting them to a broader range of health and social services.</p>
<p>The affordability, availability and functionality of these devices make them invaluable tools, but the authors point out that a successful social implementation will require closing the digital divide and tailoring devices to user preferences. In addition, the use of wearable devices must respect the autonomy and personhood of users and there is a need for proper governance of the information produced by the devices, such as policies to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which that data can be used.</p>

<p>As the second cause of death due to cancer worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is still in need of advanced prevention and treatment strategies. Here, Purushothaman and colleagues from University of California, San Diego, USA, assess the accumulative carcinogenic effect from vitamin D deficiency related to inadequate UVB exposure from sunlight.</p>
<p>By using UVB estimates data for 186 different countries obtained from NASA EOS Aura Spacecraft, authors modelled Vitamin D deficiency’s effects as a function of time where long-term chronic deficiencies correlate with increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Increasing age and environmental factors such as lower exposure to UVB radiation (e.g. living at higher latitudes) directly translated into a higher incidence of colorectal cancer. This association was more prominent in age groups over 45 years, even after taking into account factors such as life expectancy, smoking, skin pigmentation or stratospheric ozone.</p>
<p>The study highlights the need for adequate public health programs to avoid vitamin D inadequacy at national and global levels, especially in regions with lower UVB exposure.</p>

<p>The global incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases like Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease has been steadily increasing, prompting a great deal of research into treatment regimens.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by immune dysregulation and alterations in the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used increasingly to treat intestinal disorders such as UC but previous studies only use invasive endoscopic or enema-based approaches. In this prospective pilot study, Crothers from University of Vermont Medical Center, USA and colleagues set out to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of frozen, encapsulated oral FTM as treatment for UC. After 2 weeks of ambulatory oral FTM treatment, researchers observed sustained donor-induced shifts in fecal microbial composition. These changes persisted up to for 4 weeks longer than the intervals reported in previous studies using only colonoscopy FTM treatments. Longitudinal phenotyping analysis of peripheral T-cell populations also showed a correlation between decreased IL-17A and IFNγ mucosal-associated invariant T cell positivity and clinical scores improvement in patients after oral FTM.</p>
<p>Although this is a pilot study conducted on a small number of study subjects, it provides early evidence that warrants further studies on oral FTM treatments for UC.</p>

But it is more important than ever to understand why some people deny, doubt or resist scientific explanations—and what can be done to overcome these barriers to accepting science.</p><p>In our book “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/science-denial-9780190944681">Science Denial: Why It Happens and What to Do About It</a>,” we offer ways for you to understand and combat the problem. As <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzHZpAEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">two research</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VBvoFacAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">psychologists</a>, we know that everyone is susceptible to forms of it. Most importantly, we know there are solutions.</p><p>Here’s our advice on how to confront five psychological challenges that can lead to science denial.</p><h2>Challenge #1: social identity</h2><p>People are social beings and tend to align with those who hold <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119011071.iemp0153">similar beliefs and values</a>. Social media <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d43978-021-00019-4">amplify alliances</a>. You’re likely to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309214/the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser/">see more of what you already agree with</a> and fewer alternative points of view. People live in information filter bubbles created by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/02/08/code-dependent-pros-and-cons-of-the-algorithm-age/">powerful algorithms</a>. When those in your social circle share misinformation, you are more likely to believe it and share it. Misinformation multiplies and science denial grows.</p><p>Action #1: Each person has multiple social identities. One of us talked with a climate change denier and discovered he was also a grandparent. He opened up when thinking about his grandchildren’s future, and the conversation turned to economic concerns, the root of his denial. Or maybe someone is vaccine-hesitant because so are mothers in her child’s play group, but she is also a caring person, concerned about immunocompromised children.</p><p>We have found it effective to listen to others’ concerns and try to find common ground. Someone you <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-015-9312-x">connect with is more persuasive</a> than those with whom you share less in common. When one identity is blocking acceptance of the science, leverage a second identity to make a connection.</p><h2>Challenge #2: mental shortcuts</h2><p>Everyone’s busy, and it would be exhausting to be vigilant deep thinkers all the time. You see an article online with a clickbait headline such as “Eat Chocolate and Live Longer” and you share it, because you assume it is true, want it to be or think it is ridiculous.</p><p>Action #2: Instead of sharing that article on how GMOs are unhealthy, learn to slow down and monitor the quick, intuitive responses that psychologist <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557">Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 thinking</a>. Instead turn on the rational, analytical mind of System 2 and ask yourself, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2020.1730181">how do I know this is true</a>? Is it plausible? Why do I think it is true? Then do some fact-checking. Learn to not immediately accept information you already believe, which is called <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175">confirmation bias</a>.</p><h2>Challenge #3: beliefs on how and what you know</h2><p>Everyone has <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Epistemic-Cognition/Greene-Sandoval-Braten/p/book/9781138013421">ideas about what they think knowledge is</a>, where it comes from and whom to trust. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315795225-9/epistemic-cognition-psychological-construct-advancements-challenges-barbara-hofer">Some people think dualistically</a>: There’s always a clear right and wrong. But scientists view <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/0163853X.2019.1629805">tentativeness as a hallmark</a> of their discipline. Some people may not understand that scientific claims will change as more evidence is gathered, so they may be distrustful of how public health policy shifted around COVID-19.</p><p>Journalists who present “both sides” of settled scientific agreements can unknowingly persuade readers that the science is more uncertain than it actually is, turning <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001">balance into bias</a>. Only 57% of Americans surveyed accept that climate change is caused by human activity, compared with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/17/do-scientists-agree-on-climate-change/">97% of climate scientists</a>, and only <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/">55% think that scientists are certain that climate change is happening</a>.</p><p>Action #3: Recognize that other people (or possibly even you) may be operating with misguided beliefs about science. You can help them adopt what philosopher of science <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://leemcintyrebooks.com">Lee McIntyre</a> calls a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/scientific-attitude">scientific attitude</a>, an openness to seeking new evidence and a willingness to change one’s mind.</p><p>Recognize that very few individuals rely on a single authority for knowledge and expertise. Vaccine hesitancy, for example, has been successfully <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/time-doctors-take-center-stage-covid-19-vaccine-push">countered by doctors</a> who persuasively contradict erroneous beliefs, as well as by friends who explain why they <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://addisonindependent.com/joanna-colwell-i-didnt-vaccinate-my-child-and-then-i-did-0">changed their own minds</a>. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.churchleadership.com/leading-ideas/5-ways-churches-can-play-a-critical-role-in-vaccination-efforts/">Clergy can step forward</a>, for example, and some have offered places of worship as vaccination hubs.</p><h2>Challenge #4: motivated reasoning</h2><p>You might not think that how you interpret a simple graph could depend on your political views. But when people were asked to look at the same charts depicting either housing costs or the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over time, interpretations differed by political affiliation. Conservatives were more likely than progressives to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apadiv15.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/APA-2020-Hockey-Stick-1.pdf">misinterpret the graph</a> when it depicted a rise in CO2 than when it displayed housing costs. When people reason not just by examining facts, but with an unconscious bias to come to a preferred conclusion, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/what-is-motivated-reasoning-how-does-it-work-dan-kahan-answers">their reasoning will be flawed</a>.</p><p>Action #4: Maybe you think that eating food from genetically modified organisms is harmful to your health, but have you really examined the evidence? Look at articles with both pro and con information, evaluate the source of that information, and be open to the evidence leaning one way or the other. If you give yourself the time to think and reason, you can short-circuit your own motivated reasoning and open your mind to new information.</p><h2>Challenge #5: emotions and attitudes</h2><p>When Pluto got <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://theconversation.com/nasa-missions-may-re-elevate-pluto-and-ceres-from-dwarf-planets-to-full-on-planet-status-36081">demoted to a dwarf planet</a>, many children and some adults responded with anger and opposition. Emotions and attitudes are linked. Reactions to hearing that humans influence the climate can range from anger (if you do not believe it) to frustration (if you are concerned you may need to change your lifestyle) to anxiety and hopelessness (if you accept it is happening but think it’s too late to fix things). How you feel about climate mitigation or GMO labeling aligns with whether you are for or against these policies.</p><p>Action #5: Recognize the role of emotions in decision-making about science. If you react strongly to a story about stem cells used to develop Parkinson’s treatments, ask yourself if you are overly hopeful because you have a relative in early stages of the disease. Or are you rejecting a possibly lifesaving treatment because of your emotions?</p><p>Feelings shouldn’t (and can’t) be put in a box separate from how you think about science. Rather, it’s important to understand and recognize that emotions are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393709810">fully integrated ways of thinking and learning</a> about science. Ask yourself if your attitude toward a science topic is based on your emotions and, if so, give yourself some time to think and reason as well as feel about the issue.</p><p>Everyone can be susceptible to these five psychological challenges that can lead to science denial, doubt and resistance. Being aware of these challenges is the first step toward taking action to meet them.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>The research landscape constantly evolves as researchers build on prior findings, incorporate new methods, resources, and technologies, and respond to the needs of our global communities. PLOS keeps a watchful and enthusiastic eye on emerging research, and we update our policies as needed to address new challenges and opportunities that surface. In doing so, we work to advance our core mission and values aimed at transforming research communication and promoting Open Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, I summarize a few key updates we made between 2016-2021. For a more in-depth discussion of each, see the links in the &ldquo;Further reading&rdquo; section.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><br><strong>Open Science initiatives</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Partnering with bioRxiv for early access. </strong>Timely and widespread access to research output helps to inform ongoing investigations and ensure that resources and findings are used to their utmost potential. As has been exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid dissemination of research can directly impact clinical care and may in some cases have life-or-death consequences. All published PLOS articles are freely available under a CC BY license, but there is an inherent delay between research completion and peer-reviewed publication. To address this, PLOS partnered with <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> in May 2018 to give authors the option of posting submitted manuscripts as preprints. For authors who opt in, PLOS transfers manuscripts to bioRxiv after initial submission checks are complete.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Publishing peer review history. </strong>While Open Science ideals call for transparency, the industry standard has historically been to maintain the confidentiality of peer review. This provides important protections for the objectivity of the review process, enabling reviewers to contribute critical feedback without risk of personal retribution. However, it also withholds from readers information about the depth, quality, and content of the review process, and impedes research on peer review itself. PLOS has always published handling editors&rsquo; names on our articles, and we give reviewers the option to disclose their identities to authors. In May 2019, PLOS took a leap toward opening up peer review by giving authors the option to have peer review history (reviews, decision letters) published with accepted articles. Reviewers can still elect to keep their identity confidential.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Encouraging complementary research. </strong>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for multiple research groups to study the same or highly similar topics. Per traditional publishing standards, only the first report is accepted for publication and subsequent manuscripts tend to be rejected based on redundancy or lack of novelty. Viewing the same issue from another perspective, replication by independent research groups provides evidence as to the reproducibility and robustness of results. Recognizing the value of this for the scientific community, <em>PLOS Biology</em> innovated a Complementary Research policy in 2018. Under this policy, submissions are considered for publication even if a redundant or closely related study has been published or posted as a preprint within six months of the PLOS submission. This policy was expanded to all PLOS journals in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Publication ethics</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Formation of the Publication Ethics team.</strong> In January, 2018, <em>PLOS ONE</em> formed an editorial team dedicated to publication ethics. This team, whose scope expanded in 2020 to support all PLOS journals, addresses concerns raised about PLOS content, and contributes to internal policy discussions as well as external initiatives pertaining to ethics and integrity. Through this work, the team continually gains insights as to issues that commonly arise in submitted or published work and where policy or workflow updates may help. As a few examples, in 2020-21 we updated our Content and Licensing policy to clarify issues pertaining to confidential and proprietary content; elaborated our policy on Corrections, Expressions of Concern, and Retractions; and added submission guidelines about citation of retracted or corrected work.</p>



<p><strong>Blot and gel data policy.</strong> Image integrity concerns &ndash; whether due to honest errors or misconduct &ndash; present a substantial burden to the scientific and publishing communities and are often identified only after publication. Original uncropped and unadjusted image data can be instrumental in clarifying these issues, but as time passes it becomes increasingly difficult for researchers to retrieve image data from old computers and laboratory records. Toward improving the integrity and transparency of image data reporting, <em>PLOS ONE</em> and <em>PLOS Biology </em>implemented a policy in July 2019 whereby authors must provide original image data to support all reported blot and gel results. The raw images are available to editors before publication, and remain accessible indefinitely after publication in supporting information or data repositories. This provides additional assurance as to the results as well as protection for authors should post-publication questions arise. Importantly, this policy also presents a barrier against publication of fabricated results for which raw image data do not exist.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Responding to attribution needs of diverse contributors</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Identifying authors via ORCIDs. </strong>Publications are an important currency by which a researcher&rsquo;s work is measured and evaluated. However, issues around author names can hinder the discoverability and recognition of one&rsquo;s contributions. Open Researcher and Contributor IDs, or <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCIDs</a>, disambiguate research records for individuals who have the same or similar names and serve as stable identifiers through which researchers can record and promote their contributions to the public record over the course of their careers, even after name changes. Since 2013, we have given authors the option of listing ORCIDs on PLOS publications. In 2016 we began to require ORCIDs for corresponding authors, and we also started including ORCIDs with manuscript data we submit to CrossRef, which enables authors&rsquo; ORCID profiles to be automatically updated with their newly published PLOS articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Updated name change policy. </strong>For some researchers, the use of ORCIDs may not suffice to address attribution needs after mid-career name changes. For example, for transgender and non-binary gender individuals, publications under a deadname may not be identified as their own following a name change, and identifying with such publications via an ORCID or resume may reveal an aspect of one&rsquo;s personal history that the author prefers to keep private. There are also circumstances wherein an individual may find themselves at risk due to their involvement in controversial research or work that is not accepted within their community. PLOS is committed to providing an inclusive publishing environment for all researchers. To this end, in October 2020 PLOS was among the first publishers to update our Authorship policy to allow silent author name changes under certain circumstances, including for transgender and non-binary authors and authors who may be at risk. In such cases, we republish the article with the updated author list, and to honor authors&rsquo; privacy we do not notify co-authors or publish notices of republication.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Closing remarks</strong></h4>



<p>PLOS strives to address the changing needs of our communities, and we continually seek opportunities to improve research communications, including via updates to our policies and practices. We sincerely thank our contributors and partners for ongoing input and support.<br></p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Overcoming psychological barriers to vaccination remains a significant hurdle for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Any given COVID-19 news feature will remind you that vaccine hesitancy is rife, especially in countries such as the United States. Compounding the issue further, even those who fully intend to get their jab can be forgetful or procrastinate, further hampering efforts to get shots in arms.</p>



<p>As such, it’s vital to develop an effective toolbox to make it as effortless and appealing as possible for patients to book and turn up for their appointments. And though they may seem insignificant, one of the most useful behavioural nudges we have at our disposal is the mighty reminder message.</p>



<p>Crafting the wording of a reminder that packs a punch is no easy feat. As with most things in psychology, individual differences can greatly affect the response to any given nudge. But, thanks to research from Hengchen Dai at UCLA and team, we now have a better impression of how text-message reminders can impact vaccine uptake, as well as how to word them.</p>



<span id="more-43345"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03843-2">Their study</a>, published in Nature, describes two sequential randomised control trials on the topic. In the first study, the investigators recruited a massive 93,354 participants who had received an initial notification that they were eligible for their vaccine. The team randomly allocated participants in a 4:1 ratio to either a group that was sent a booking reminder text-message one day later, or a control group that received no reminder message.</p>



<p>Within the group that received the message, the authors looked at how different types of information provision and language affected uptake. All messages included two main points: a reminder of vaccine availability, and a link to an appointment scheduling website which allowed participants to book their slot right away. A subset of these also included language intended to induce a feeling of ownership over vaccines — specifically, the phrase “claim your dose”. This isn’t the first time this approach has been used; similar phrasing has been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101165118">shown to increase uptake</a> of flu vaccines.</p>



<p>To combat hesitancy and misunderstandings, a two-minute video aiming to dispel common vaccine misconceptions was also provided alongside a subsection of reminder messages, both with and without ownership induction phrases. Unfortunately, the authors note that only 21% of participants actually chose to watch it.</p>



<p>The team were interested in whether or not participants booked their vaccination appointment within six days following the first reminder, and whether they actually turned up and got their first dose within four weeks of the reminder. And they found that the messages worked: only 7.2% of those who didn’t receive a reminder booked within those six days, but this increased by 6.07 percentage points among those who received a reminder. Similarly, 13.89% of the non-reminder group had received their vaccine within four weeks, but this increased by 3.57 percentage points among those who received the text message.</p>



<p>Better yet, the reminders containing language inducing feelings of ownership over the vaccines appeared to be most effective, boosting appointment and vaccination rates by 6.83 and 4.13 percentage points, respectively, relative to those that received no reminder. This provides a strong endorsement for this type of phrasing in vaccination reminders.</p>



<p>Though these results are very promising, the study found no evidence to suggest that provision of information addressing vaccine hesitancy alongside these reminders was more effective at increasing uptake. However, given the small number of participants who actually watched the videos, this topic merits further investigation.</p>



<p>The second RCT (N=67,092) looked at additional reminder messages, sent eight days after initial vaccine eligibility to those who had not yet booked their first dose and may have been procrastinating or hesitant. The second, further reminder increased booking and vaccination rates by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively, compared to those who didn’t get a second message.</p>



<p>Further studies will be needed to fully understand whether this approach holds across other cultures outside of California. Establishing a feeling of ownership over vaccination decisions may be more or less motivating in different countries, and even in different areas within the United States, which could significantly affect the potency of this approach. Within this study, at least, analyses suggest that these increases in uptake were not largely affected by race or age, which may be promising for wider application.</p>



<p>Overall, these findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions. Not only are reminders clearly valuable tools in our arsenal, but wording that is crafted to induce feelings of ownership over vaccines appears to be particularly effective in increasing uptake. Adopting this as a standard approach for COVID-19 vaccine messaging in the USA, the authors estimate, could result in an additional 4.73 to 7.42 million people taking up the vaccine within a month of the reminder. In a moment where even small increases in vaccine uptake can have a tangible impact on the health of the population, research such as this serves to underline the impact that psychology can have when practically applied.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-stolen-fossil-big-head-walking-flying">This big-headed pterosaur may have preferred walking over flying</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2013, a police raid at Santos Harbor in Brazil recovered about 30,000 smuggled fossils, including the most intact specimen of a type of big-headed pterosaur ever found. A new analysis of the fossil provides <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254789">insight into the flying reptile’s foraging style, flight capability and anatomy</a>, researchers report August 25 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>Identified as <em>Tupandactylus navigans</em>, the fossil is a member of a group of pterosaurs called tapejarids. These pterosaurs are known for their oversize, crested skulls, and hail from the early Cretaceous Period, which lasted from about 145 million to 100 million years ago.</p>



<p>Some well-preserved tapejarid fossils have been found in China, but they aren’t as complete as the newly analyzed fossil, and the pterosaur’s anatomy hadn’t been fully described. “This is the first time we have the full skull and the full [body],” says Victor Beccari, a paleontologist at the NOVA School of Science &amp; Technology in Caparica, Portugal.</p>



<p>When Beccari’s team received the fossil in 2016, it had already been cut into six blocks. “It’s a shame,” Beccari says, “but we used it to our advantage.” The researchers fit the sliced pieces inside a CT scanner, and then used the scans to produce a 3-D model of the pterosaur’s skeleton that revealed parts still buried inside rock.</p>

Beccari</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previous studies suggested that tapejarids had a short, stout neck to support their large head during flight. But Beccari’s team showed that the neck accounted for over half of the spine’s length, which could have made sustained flight difficult. The fossil’s long hind legs and relatively short arms hint that tapejarids could have been comfortable walking.</p>



<p>These observations suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> may have behaved similarly to peacocks, Beccari says. The tapejarid’s crest probably attracted mates, and the pterosaur may have flown to treetops to look for food or escape from predators, he says. “But it spent most of its time walking on the ground.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-skeleton-woman-indonesia-peopling-southeast-asian-islands">Ancient DNA shows the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was surprisingly complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A young woman who lived on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi as early as around 7,300 years ago had a surprisingly ancient East Asian pedigree, mixed with a dash of Denisovan ancestry, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Researchers excavated the woman’s partial skeleton from South Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03823-6">analysis of her DNA</a> shows that she was a descendent of mainly East Asian <em>Homo sapiens</em> who probably reached the tropical outpost at least 50,000 years ago, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, many scientists thought that skilled mariners and farmers called Austronesians first spread East Asian genes through Wallacea, a group of islands between mainland Asia and Australia that includes Sulawesi, Lombok and Flores, around 3,500 years ago.</p>



<p>The ancient Sulawesi woman’s DNA “provides the first indication that an Asian ancestry was present in Wallacea long before the Austronesian expansion,” says archaeologist Adam Brumm of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.</p>



<p>Indonesian archaeologists who unearthed the skeleton — and who coauthored the new study with Brumm, population geneticist Selina Carlhoff of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and other colleagues — nicknamed the young woman, who was 17 or 18 years old when she died, Besse (pronounced BESS-eh). In ethnic communities of South Sulawesi, Besse is an affectionate term for individual girls and women.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="737" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg" alt="researchers working at Leang Panninge cave" class="wp-image-3102934" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-535x383.jpg 535w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-629x450.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-260x186.jpg 260w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-811x580.jpg 811w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102934">Researchers work at the entrance to Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. Ancient DNA was extracted from a hunter-gatherer’s skeleton excavated inside the cave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102934">Leang Panninge research team</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After arriving on Sulawesi, the woman’s ancestors mated with Denisovans who already inhabited the island, the investigators suspect. Known mainly from ancient DNA samples, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fossil-denisovan-skull-cave-siberia">Denisovans</a> are a group of mysterious ancient hominids who date to as early as around 300,000 years ago in Siberia and survived on nearby Papua New Guinea until as late as 30,000 to 15,000 years ago (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>The discovery of Besse shows that the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was much more complex than has typically been appreciated, says population geneticist Lluis Quintana-Murci of Collége de France and the Pasteur Institute, both in Paris. “Wallacea was probably a key habitat region for Denisovan-related groups,” adds Quintana-Murci, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>The researchers estimate that the ancient Sulawesi woman inherited about 2.2 percent of her DNA from Denisovans. That’s a bit less than some other groups in the region. Indigenous groups in the Philippines carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">the highest known levels of Denisovan ancestry, topping out at about 5 percent</a> (<em>SN: 8/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Earlier genetic evidence suggested that different Denisovan populations interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> groups in the Philippines and on a land mass that included what’s now Papua New Guinea and Australia. The Sulawesi woman’s DNA indicates that interbreeding occurred in Wallacea as some Stone Age <em>H. sapiens</em> made their way toward Papua New Guinea and Australia. “The major gene flow from Denisovans into ancestors of Papuans and Aboriginal Australians most likely took place once [<em>H. sapiens</em>] reached the Wallacea islands,” says population geneticist and study coauthor Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>





<p>The woman’s DNA more closely resembles that of present-day Papuans and Indigenous Australians than of any current mainland East Asians, the scientists say. Those comparisons indicate that she belonged to a previously unknown, distinct genetic line of humans that emerged around 37,000 years ago, roughly the same time as a previously estimated evolutionary split of Papuans from Indigenous Australians. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Carefully crafted stone points that had been placed in the ancient woman’s grave identify her as a member of South Sulawesi’s Toalean hunter-gatherer people, Brumm says. Toalean stone artifacts date to between roughly 8,000 and 1,500 years ago. Evidence of Toalean culture disappears after that.</p>



<p>The Indonesian coauthors of the new study excavated the ancient woman’s partial skeleton from 2015 to 2019. Surviving fossils mainly came from the skull and pelvis. DNA was extracted from a dense bone in the base of the skull that’s known to preserve genetic material especially well. Fossils in tropical climates like Indonesia’s rarely yield ancient DNA because the fragile genetic material doesn’t typically survive those conditions.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of a burned seed from a common Southeast Asian tree, which was found near the skeleton, provided an age estimate of between around 7,300 and 7,200 years.</p>



<p>It’s not known if ancestors of Besse created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-cave-painting-art-pig-found-indonesia">previously discovered Sulawesi rock art of a pig that dates to at least 45,500 years ago</a>, one of the oldest known artistic depictions of a real-world organism (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). So the artists of that work remain a mystery, for now.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Imposter syndrome — the feeling that you don&#8217;t belong or aren&#8217;t capable at work or in education — can affect anybody. But people from underrepresented backgrounds are more likely to experience imposter syndrome: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">first generation university students</a>, for example, or <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-09930-002">people of colour</a>.</p>



<p>Imposter syndrome can be particularly acute in academia, where intellectual flair is prized. In fact, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-70498-001">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Educational Psychology</em> finds that in fields in which intellectual “brilliance” is perceived to be a prerequisite to success, imposter syndrome is more likely to strike women and early-career academics.</p>



<span id="more-43350"></span>



<p>Participants were 4,870 academics from nine universities in the United States, all of which had a medical school, were research intensive, and were ranked in the country’s top 100 institutions. After noting down their field of research, participants completed a measure of imposter feelings, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am afraid people important to me may find out that I am not as capable as they think I am”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, they filled in measures of belonging (how accepted they felt by others in their field) and self-efficacy (how confident they were in their ability to succeed). Finally, participants indicated to what extent they felt brilliance was required for success in their field, again indicating agreement or disagreement with statements such as “being a top scholar of [my discipline] requires a special aptitude that just can’t be taught” and “I think that with the right amount of effort and dedication, anyone can be a top scholar of [my discipline]”.</p>



<p>Overall, women reported more imposter feelings than men. And women reported greater feelings of being an imposter the more that they believed their field was oriented towards natural brilliance rather than hard work. Those early on in their careers also reported more imposter feelings than those on faculty or in more secure positions, and again reported greater imposter feelings the more that they felt their field required natural brillance. People who reported more imposter feelings were also likely to rate themselves as lower in self-efficacy and lower in feelings of belonging to their wider field.</p>



<p>The gender differences were even starker when the team looked at the ethnic background of academics, too: compared to White or Asian women, women from underrepresented minority backgrounds experienced even greater levels of imposter syndrome in fields perceived as emphasising brilliance. So although the results were only correlational, the more a field was perceived to have an emphasis on or need for raw brilliance or genius, the more certain groups — women, people from ethnic groups underrepresented in academia, and early-career academics — were likely to experience imposter feelings and a lack of belonging.</p>



<p>Beyond the potential distress or stress that imposter feelings can cause, there could also be other ramifications. Low levels of self-efficacy and belonging are likely to impact not only productivity but likelihood of continuing in the field. Indeed, the team notes that the lower level of&nbsp; imposter feelings among established academics could be down to a survivorship bias: those who never feel like they don’t belong are more likely to pursue a further career in academia than those who feel a lack of community or lack of ability. A longitudinal study could explore this further. If those who feel a lack of belonging are also more likely to belong to underrepresented groups, this could also hinder efforts to make particular fields more diverse.</p>



<p>It could also be that we need to reframe how we think about imposter syndrome altogether. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.1924137">Other research</a>, for example, has suggested that &#8220;imposterism&#8221; is a bad lens through which to view the struggles Black doctoral students face in racist environments. Rather than framing imposter feelings as an internal phenomenon, it may be more helpful to think about those barriers that stand in the way of certain people feeling comfortable and successful in their fields – and to try to break those barriers down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">Racism lurks in names given to plants and animals. That’s starting to change</a></h4>

              
                <p>With lemon and black plumage, the Scott’s oriole flashes in the desert like a flame. But the bird’s name holds a violent history that Stephen Hampton can’t forget. He used to see the orioles often, living in California. Now that he lives outside the bird’s range, “I’m kind of relieved,” he says.</p>



<p>Hampton is a birder and registered citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Winfield Scott, a U.S. military commander and the bird’s namesake, drove Hampton’s ancestors and other Native Americans from their land in the 1800s during a series of forced marches now known as the Trail of Tears. The journey killed over 4,000 Cherokee, displacing <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/482714?refreqid=excelsior%3Af88ed89a5d19437b33a44e3a3f1c42c0">as many as 100,000</a> people in the end.</p>



<p>“So much of the Trail of Tears is already erased,” Hampton says. “There’s a few historical sites, but you’d have to be an archaeologist to figure out where the actual stockades were.” Linking Scott’s legacy to a bird “is just adding to the erasure by putting another layer over it.” </p>



<p>The oriole is just one of dozens of species that scientists are considering renaming because of racist or other offensive connotations. In a groundswell of revision, scientists are wrestling with this heritage. </p>





<p>Racist relics can infuse both scientific and common names. But in contrast to scientific names — which are internationally standardized in Latin — common names live in the vernacular. They vary by language and region, and have a smaller scope than scientific names’ international reach, making them arguably simpler to change. Some get immortalized in field guides and formally recognized by scientific societies. These common names provide a useful shared language for scientists and the public, but they can also enshrine harmful legacies. Advocates for change see some names as barriers to inclusion and distractions from the organisms themselves. But those advocates also see opportunities in renaming.</p>



<p>“We can choose language that reflects our shared values,” says Jessica Ware, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and president-elect of the Entomological Society of America, or ESA. Name changes themselves are nothing new; scientific and common names both shift as scientists learn more about a species. The ESA keeps a list of English common names for insects, updated annually.</p>



<p>In July, the ESA removed the pejorative term “gypsy,” what many consider to be a slur for Romani people, from its common name list for two insects, the moth <em>Lymantria dispar</em> and the ant <em>Aphaenogaster araneoides</em>. The ESA has invited new name suggestions from the public. In the meantime, the insects will go by their internationally recognized scientific names.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a moral, necessary and long-overdue change,” says Margareta Matache, a Roma rights activist and scholar at Harvard University. It’s a “small yet historic” step to rectify portrayals where “Roma have been denied humanity or depicted as less than human,” she says.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">Better Common Names Project</a>, the ESA now prohibits names perpetuating negative stereotypes, and welcomes public input about which names to change next. So far, over 80 insensitive names have been identified, and over 100 name ideas for <em>L. dispar</em> have streamed in, Ware says. With a “bottom-up swelling of names” to choose from, “everybody is included,” she says.</p>



<p>But racist legacies lurk in lingo.<strong> </strong>Some scorpions, birds, fishes and flowers are known by the label Hottentot, a term of abuse for Indigenous Khoikhoi people in southern Africa. The Digger pine tree bears a pejorative for the Paiute people in the western United States, once derisively called diggers by white settlers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Changing offensive common names of species is nothing new</h3>



<p>It’s not unusual for common names, or even Latin names, of species to change. Sometimes new information about a species prompts a name change, but as the following examples show, names deemed offensive have been revised for at least two decades.</p>



<p><strong>Pikeminnow</strong> (<em>Ptychocheilus</em>): Four pikeminnow fish species were once called “squawfish,” using an offensive term for Native American women. In 1998, the American Fisheries Society changed the name, as an “exceptional” example of a violation of “good taste.”</p>



<p><strong>Long-tailed duck</strong> (<em>Clangula hyemalis</em>): In 2000, the American Ornithological Society renamed the derogatory “Oldsquaw” duck after urging from Indigenous communities — but not officially because the name was offensive. “Long-tailed duck” was already used in Europe, so the reasoning of maintaining consistency was accepted.</p>



<p><strong>Goliath grouper</strong> (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>): This 800-pound fish was formerly known as the “jewfish.” The American Fisheries Society changed the name in 2001, after a petition citing the name’s offensiveness.</p>
</div>



<p>The bird world, in particular, has been reckoning with such legacies. Birds named for people proliferated in 19th century ornithology, glorifying the namers themselves or figures they favored. Today, 142 North American bird names endure as verbal monuments to people. Some names — such as Scott’s oriole, chosen by naturalist and U.S. military officer Darius Nash Couch — lionize people who participated in genocide. Others — such as Bachman’s sparrow, named after Lutheran minister and naturalist John Bachman — venerate people who defended slavery. “Blacks and Native Americans would have always been opposed to these names,” Hampton says.</p>



<p>Since 2020, supporters of the grassroots campaign <a href="https://birdnamesforbirds.wordpress.com/">Bird Names for Birds</a> have advocated for a solution — replace all eponymous bird names with descriptive ones. “It&#8217;s not a be-all-end-all solution” to removing barriers to birding for minority communities, says Robert Driver, an evolutionary biologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C. But it’s one gesture of “consideration for everyone who&#8217;s out there with binoculars.”</p>



<p>The American Ornithological Society initially rejected Driver’s proposal to revise the name of a brownish-gray bird called McCown’s longspur, named after Confederate general John P. McCown. But after the 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide reflection on systemic racism and as some Confederate monuments were removed and sports teams with offensive epithets were renamed, the ornithology society changed its policies to consider a namesake’s role in “reprehensible events” as grounds for revision. Now, the bird is known as the thick-billed longspur. <strong></strong></p>



<p>Driver wants Scott’s oriole to be next — but for now, English bird name changes have paused while a committee with the society <a href="https://americanornithology.org/english-bird-names/whats-next-for-english-bird-names/">recommends a new name-changing process</a>. “We are committed to changing these harmful and exclusionary names,” says Mike Webster, an ornithologist at Cornell University and president of the society.</p>



<p>Removing harmful terms offers long-term stability in common names, Ware says. With thoughtful criteria, scientists and others can craft names built to last. “So it might be uncomfortable now,” Ware says. “But hopefully, that only happens once.”</p>



<p>As for Hampton, he doesn’t see Scott’s oriole anymore, now that he lives in Washington State. But he still can’t escape these types of names. Sometimes while birding, he spies Townsend’s solitaire — a bird that favors juniper berries. It’s named after American naturalist John Kirk Townsend, who collected Indigenous people’s skulls in the 1830s for cranial measurements that were used to justify pseudoscientific racial hierarchies. “Every time I see one [of the birds], I&#8217;m thinking, ‘That should be juniper solitaire,’” Hampton says. In his mind’s eye, Scott’s oriole is the yucca oriole. “I can&#8217;t wait for those to be changed.”</p>
