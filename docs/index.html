              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insulin-longevity-aging-ant-queens">A clever molecular trick extends the lives of these ant queens</a></h4>

              
                <p>For some ant queens, the secret to long life might be a self-produced insulin blocker.</p>



<p>Ant queens are famously long-lived, even though they shouldn’t be. Generally, animals that put lots of energy into reproduction sacrifice some time off their life. But ant queens produce millions of eggs and live an extraordinarily long time compared with worker ants that don’t reproduce.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have shown how one ant species pulls off this anti-aging feat. When queens and wannabe queens of the species <em>Harpegnathos saltator</em> gear up to reproduce, a part of what’s called the insulin signaling pathway <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8767">gets blocked</a>, slowing aging, the researchers report in the Sept. 2 <em>Science</em>. That molecular pathway has long been implicated in aging in mammals, including humans.</p>





<p>“There’s been a need to understand why queens, or reproductives, in social insects can live for so amazingly long,” says Marc Tatar, a biologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved with the study. Some ant species have queens that survive 30 times as long as their workers. Other social insects such as bees and termites also have long-lived queens.</p>



<p>In a rare behavior for ants, when a queen <em>H. saltator </em>dies, some female workers begin competing in duels for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/insect-queens-sterilize-workers-similar-chemical">the chance to replace her</a> (<em>SN: 1/17/14</em>). These hopeful royals develop ovaries, start laying eggs and transition into queenlike forms called gamergates. When a worker transitions to a gamergate, her life span becomes five times as long as it was. But if she doesn’t end up becoming queen and reverts back to a worker, her life span shortens again.</p>



<p>The researchers exploited this behavior to investigate the molecular underpinnings of anti-aging in these ants. <em>H. saltator </em>gamergates, it turns out, extend their life spans by taking advantage of a split in the insulin signaling pathway, the chain of chemical reactions that drive insulin’s effects on the body. One branch of this pathway is involved with reproduction, while the other is implicated in aging.</p>



<p>“Insulin comes with our life — [after] we eat, we have high insulin,” says Hua Yan, a biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “But a constant high level of insulin is bad for longevity.”</p>



<p>Examining patterns of gene activity, Yan and colleagues found that gamergates have more active insulin genes than regular worker ants and, as a result, have increased metabolic activity and ovary development. But the secret sauce protecting the ants from the insulin’s aging effects appears to be a molecule called Imp-L2, which blocks the branch of the insulin pathway linked to aging, experiments showed. The branch involved in reproduction, however, remains active.</p>



<p>“What we don’t understand is how Imp-L2 can act on one aspect of the pathway and not on the other,” says study coauthor Claude Desplan, a developmental biologist at New York University.</p>



<p>These results represent a leap forward in our understanding of extreme social insect longevity, the researchers say, while also showcasing an anti-aging evolutionary adaptation that hasn’t been seen in the wild before.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538754153">The Milky Way</a><br><em>Moiya McTier</em><br><em>Grand Central Publishing, $27</em></p>



<p>Meet the Milky Way in its own words.</p>



<p><em>The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy</em> takes a tour of our home in the cosmos from an unexpected perspective. Astrophysicist and folklorist Moiya McTier presents herself not as the author, but as the lucky human vessel through which the Milky Way has chosen to tell its story. Then she lets the galaxy take it away, with humor, heart and a huge dose of snark.</p>





<p>The book alternates chapters between science and mythology, reflecting McTier’s dual specialties (her bio says she was the first student in Harvard University’s history to study both). “Many of you don’t realize this, but myths were some of your species’ first attempt at scientific inquiry,” the Milky Way tells us.</p>



<p>The Milky Way is telling its story now because it’s sick of being ignored. Once upon a time, humans looked to the glittering smudge of stars in the sky for insight into when to plant crops or avoid floods. We told stories about the Milky Way’s importance in the origin and fate of the world.</p>



<p>Our galaxy ate it up: For an entity that spends most of its time ripping up smaller galaxies and watching its own stars die, “your stories made me feel loved and needed and, perhaps for the first time in my long existence, more helpful than I was ruinous.” But in the last few centuries, technology and light pollution have pulled humankind away. “At first, I thought it was just a phase,” the Milky Way says. “Then I remembered … that several hundred years is actually a long time for humans.”</p>





<p>So the Milky Way decided to remind us why it’s so important. Its autobiography covers big-picture scientific questions about galaxies, like where they come from (“When a gas cloud loves itself very much,” the Milky Way explains, “it hugs itself extra tight, and after a few hundred million years, a baby galaxy is born. Leave the storks out of it, please.”). It also gets into what galaxies are made of, how they interact with other galaxies, and how they live and die. The book then zooms out to cover the origins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-end-everything-explores-ways-universe-could-perish">possible ends of the universe</a>, mysteries like dark matter and dark energy, and even humankind’s search for other intelligent life (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The author takes pains to explain scientific jargon and the technical tools that astronomers use to study the sky. A lot of popular astronomy writing glosses over how astronomers think about cosmic distance or exactly what a spectrum is, but not this book. If you’ve ever been curious about these insider details, <em>The Milky Way</em> has you covered.</p>



<p>McTier’s version of our home galaxy is heavily anthropomorphized. The Milky Way is brash, vain and arrogant in a way that may hide a secret insecurity. Its central black hole is characterized as the physical embodiment of the galaxy’s shame and regrets, a source of deep existential angst. And its relationship with the Andromeda galaxy is like a long-term, long-distance romance, with each galaxy sending stars back and forth as love notes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole-collision-simulation">until the two can eventually merge</a> (<em>SN: 3/05/21</em>).</p>



<p>This could have felt gimmicky. But McTier’s efforts to make the metaphors work while keeping the science accurate and up-to-date made the premise endearing and entertaining.</p>



<p>I laughed twice on Page 1. I learned a new word on Page 2. I dog-eared the endnotes early on because it became instantly clear I would want to read every one. I read this book while traveling in rural upstate New York, where the sky is much clearer than at my home outside of Boston. <em>The Milky Way</em> reminded me to look up and appreciate my home in the universe, just like its narrator wanted. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-cheers-the-ostp-memorandum/">PLOS cheers the OSTP memorandum “Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research”</a></h4>

              
                <p>We were thrilled last Thursday to read Dr. Alondra Nelson&rsquo;s United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">memorandum</a> on the subject of &ldquo;Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vision expressed in the memo represents a tremendous step toward the future of scientific research communication that PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/about/">has been working toward</a> since our founding in 2001. It truly is a watershed moment for the US research community and everyone who has a stake in scientific communications.</p>



<p>The memo requires US federal granting bodies to develop and implement new policies making all tax-payer funded scholarly research and underlying raw data freely and publicly available without embargo by 2026. Importantly, the guidance applies to all federal agencies with R&amp;D expenditures, regardless of budget size or the subject area of the research being funded.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks and months, we will consider and expand on what this memo, and other policy advancements around the world, mean for Open Scholarship and Open Science, and how we can all play our part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, we want to confirm that <strong>publishing in any</strong> <strong>PLOS journal already meets or exceeds the requirements outlined in the OSTP memo.</strong> Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Free public access to scholarly publications</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should update or develop new public access plans for ensuring&hellip;that all peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or coauthored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally funded research </em><strong><em>are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without any embargo or delay after publication.</em></strong><em>&rdquo;</em> (emphasis in the original) p. 3</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS is and always has been a fully Open Access publisher. Everything we publish is available under a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-access/">CC BY</a> copyright license. That means the research is not only publicly accessible&mdash;it&rsquo;s also freely available for redistribution, remixing, and reuse.</p>



<p>PLOS began publishing journals precisely to provide venues that would lead this kind of transformation in science communication. You might even say <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">we were born for this</a> moment. We helped catalyze a change in scholarly publishing when we launched <em>PLOS Biology</em> in 2003. Since then, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio to include <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">12 journals</a> serving researchers in all areas of science and medicine to make all high quality and impactful research openly accessible to everyone.</p>



<h2>No delays or embargos</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><em>&ldquo;OSTP recommends that federal agencies&hellip;make publications and their supporting data resulting from federally funded research publicly accessible without an <strong>embargo on their free and public release</strong>.&rdquo; </em>(emphasis in the original) p. 1</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>At PLOS, everything we publish is freely available for anyone, anywhere in the world to read, cite, share, or iterate upon, right from the very start.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve always believed knowledge should be available to all without barriers. PLOS publishes research that meets the highest standards of methodological and ethical rigor, without restrictions, delays, or reader fees. We also support preprint-posting across each of our journals so you can make your work available as soon as you&rsquo;re ready.</p>



<h2>Machine readable</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right">&ldquo;<em>Federal agencies should aim &ldquo;to maximize equitable reach of public access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications, including by providing free online access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications in formats that allow for machine-readability.&rdquo;</em> p. 3-4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>All PLOS articles and published peer reviews are fully machine readable, indexed, and archived to enhance discoverability, and enable further parsing, cross-referencing, processing, and analysis. Plus, our entire corpus is available for download through the <a href="https://github.com/PLOS/allofplos">AllofPLOS</a> project in order to facilitate meta-analysis of the research we publish, and meta-research into publishing patterns.</p>



<h2>Public data</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Scientific data underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from federally funded research should be made freely available and publicly accessible by default at the time of publication&rdquo;</em> p. 4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>Since 2014, PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">Data Availability</a> policy has required that the raw data underlying each study we publish be made publicly available upon publication.</p>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research. Data are key for verification, replication and reanalysis, to inform future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Demonstrating that level of transparency with the research community signals integrity and inspires trust in return.</p>



<h2>Research integrity through metadata</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should take actions to ensure that these elements of scientific and research integrity are in place in order to strengthen public trust in federally funded science&hellip;The public should be able to identify which federal agencies support given investments in science, the scientists who conduct that research, and the extent to which peer-review was conducted.&rdquo;</em> p. 5-6</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS prominently displays data availability, funding, and competing interest statements on each article we publish. We use ORCID IDs to identify and distinguish individual researchers, and the CRediT classification system to describe each author&rsquo;s specific contributions to the work. DOIs and sub-DOIs make it easy to cite our articles, figures, and datasets, as well as the associated Published Peer Review History. Our partnerships, together with our archival and indexing standards enable bi-directional linking to and from each article, and its related research products on other sites, including preprints, Open Data, Open Methods, Open Code.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Moving Open Science beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Of course, we recognize a transition to OA publication comes with many other considerations for researchers who have not done so before. The features above are embedded in our journals and publishing process to make it as easy as possible for authors, and we are always working with research communities to improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, we acknowledge Article Processing Charges (APCs) pose a barrier for many researchers and we are experimenting with new business models designed to reflect the true cost of publication, and to allocate costs more fairly, making Open Access publishing accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>PLOS already has partnerships with many US institutions to make the cost of publishing free for those researchers. Check our list of <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/#us">partner institutions</a> to see if your institution has an existing agreement. We are always reaching out to new institutions to expand coverage for authors.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/meet-the-editor-in-chief-plos-medicine/">Meet the new Editor-in-Chief of PLOS Medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are delighted to be introducing the new Editor-in-Chief of <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/?utm_id=323&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=323med0922&amp;utm_content=in_copy_link">PLOS Medicine</a></em>, Prof. Dr. Till B&auml;rnighausen! He brings with him a wealth of expertise and experience in the major drivers of good health, as well as interventions that can improve and support health at population level. He is committed to increasing the uptake of open science practices in the medical community, and advocates for more transparency in the process of research practice.</p>



<p>Till has kindly answered some of our burning questions about himself, his background, and what he plans to bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. Get to know him a little better with this short interview.</p>



<h3>What is the specific background and expertise do you bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>



<p>I originally trained as a family physician and bring research domain competence on many of the major global disease burdens &ndash; including HIV, diabetes, hypertension, and depression &ndash; to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, paired with broad methods competence for the design and evaluation of interventions and policies that address these burdens. I have research expertise and experience in multiple disciplines, such as epidemiology, data science, economics, health systems research, and design and implementation research.</p>



<h3><br>How do you align with the Executive Editor&rsquo;s expertise and interests? And can you anticipate what will be the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy you and the Executive Editor are developing?</h3>



<p>Raffaella Bosurgi (Executive Editor) and I share expertise and interests in the major biological, behavioural, social, and environmental drivers of good health, as well as the interventions and policies that can substantially boost health at the population level. I anticipate that the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy will focus thematically on the most promising solutions to the massive preventable and curable disease burdens that continue to persist and increase; in particular in the world&rsquo;s resource-poorest communities and countries. </p>



<p>Major new movements in health systems worldwide &ndash; such as healthcare in everyday places, health promotion through social networks, and digital and mobile approaches to reach resource-poor and left-behind populations &ndash; require design research to create interventions and evaluation research to establish causal impact, performance, and social and economic value.<em> PLOS Medicine</em> should strive to be the first choice for researchers to publish ground-breaking research on solutions to the world&rsquo;s largest and most pressing health problems. </p>



<p>Methodologically, I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus equally strongly on high-quality clinical evidence, such as from efficacy trials and large clinical cohorts, and on population evidence, such as from health policy experiments and quasi-experiments. Last but not least I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus on the important and complex relationships between human health and the environment and how both can thrive in respect of each other in order to build more resilient societies and futures.</p>



<h3><br>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</h3>



<p>Part of the PLOS family of journals, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has been at the forefront of the Open Science movement since its inception in 2004. As this movement advances, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has an opportunity to further broaden its &lsquo;openness&rsquo;. As Editor-in-Chief, I will work with the Executive Editor and the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> leadership team, editorial board, reviewers and authors to consider initiatives for open engagement of other societal actors in publishing scientific articles on health and medicine. For instance, the beneficiaries of findings published in the journal could be invited comment, providing novel perspectives on the value and usefulness of a particular piece. Similarly, themes for special issues could be decided in open engagement with patient representatives, health professionals, and funders of science.</p>



<p><br><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is already strongly and visibly committed to open peer review and open data. It could further boost the &lsquo;openness&rsquo; of the knowledge that it publishes by trialling and implementing novel approaches to sharing documentation of the processes that have generated data and the analytical code that has turned data into results.</p>



<h3><br>What developments are occurring in Medicine or your field of expertise that excite you at this time?</h3>



<p>I am excited by the promise (and fearful of the perils) of &lsquo;high tech&rsquo; for health promotion, and disease prevention and treatment. For interventions: digital approaches for health literacy and personalized health promotion, contextual social marketing for healthy lives, and for linking patients for mutual and real-time treatment support. For insight, such as wearables and sensors to measure exposures and outcomes in far greater detail and with far greater time resolution than in traditional visit-based studies. I am also excited by the potential of &lsquo;low tech&rsquo; for population health. Things such as salt reduction and substitution to reduce blood pressure, green and blue space exposure to boost mental resilience and health, and delayed prescriptions to reduce antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance.</p>



<h3><br>What is a topic in medical research you wish you knew more about?</h3>



<p>Network science. In particular how we can better use physical, biological, cognitive, and social network information to understand more deeply what drives population health &ndash; and how we can leverage networks for health interventions and policies.</p>



<h3><br>What is a fun fact about you?</h3>



<p>My favourite past time activities are skiing and playing old-fashioned board games with our kids, Amelie, Elias and Leo.</p>



<h3><br>What&rsquo;s on your reading list for the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> community?</h3>



<p>This summer I am reading three books. <em>A shot to save the world</em> by Gregory Zuckerman, which describes the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. I expect this will hold some important lessons on developing future systems to respond to new threats to population health. <em>Theory and reality</em> by Peter Godfrey-Smith, a wonderfully written survey of the major intellectual movements that have conceived science, and how they have challenged each other. I am rereading this book. <em>The art of gathering</em> by Priya Parker, which includes many recommendations for making meetings matter more. This book seems particularly timely as we are emerging from the COVID-related restrictions to our gatherings and have an opportunity to redesign how we meet in the coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">Who has the highest risk of long COVID? It’s complicated</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of people, COVID-19 doesn’t end with a negative test. Weeks or months after traces of the virus disappear from noses and throats, symptoms can persist or come back. New ones might pop up and stick around for months. People suffering from long COVID are unwillingly in it for the long haul — and it’s still unclear who’s at the highest risk for the condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers don’t yet have an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">official definition for long COVID</a>, and its symptoms are wide-ranging (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). Some people struggle with extreme fatigue that interferes with their daily lives. Others can’t concentrate or struggle with memory amid thick brain fog. Still others have organ damage or a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.</p>





<p>“There are a variety of different kinds of ways that people can have long COVID. It’s not just the one thing,” says Leora Horwitz, an internal medicine physician at New York University Langone Health. “That’s what makes it so hard to study.”</p>



<p>This spectrum of symptoms makes pinning down who’s at high risk for long-term health problems from the disease especially hard. Some post-COVID conditions may stem from virus-induced damage or from the stress of being hospitalized with severe disease. In other cases, the body’s own immune response to the virus could drive the damage. Or the virus may be hiding somewhere in the body, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">possibly the gut</a>, helping symptoms to persist (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). Different causes may have different risk groups, says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group studying long COVID.</p>



<p>There are some broad hints about who’s at risk. Studies suggest that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2022.2081454">women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms</a>. COVID-19 patients with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y">more than five symptoms in the first week of infection</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30836-0">preexisting health conditions such as asthma</a> may be more likely to develop long COVID. Age also appears to be a risk factor, though results are mixed regarding <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/nine-factors-could-boost-your-risk-long-covid">whether the burden falls on older people or middle-aged people</a>. Populations that were disproportionally hit by COVID-19 overall — including Black and Hispanic people — may similarly face disparities for long COVID. And while vaccination seems to protect people from developing long COVID, Horwitz says, it’s still unclear by how much.</p>



<p>Age is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html">more than 30 health problems</a>, including cancer and lung disease, that also raise the risk. “So many researchers assume that those [risk factors] will be the same for long COVID and there’s no scientific basis for that,” Davis says. There are many more that researchers could be missing when it comes to long COVID.</p>



<p>Using health records and exams, and knowledge of ailments with symptoms similar to long COVID, experts are on the hunt for those risk factors. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Examining health</h4>



<p>When it comes to getting a better handle on who’s at risk for long COVID — which also goes by the wonky alias Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection — electronic health records may hold important clues.</p>



<p>Horwitz is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER initiative that <a href="https://recovercovid.org/">aims to understand the long-term impacts</a> of COVID-19. One arm of the study involves mining millions of electronic health records to find potential patterns.</p>



<p>Studying millions of these records should pinpoint potential risk factors that are rare in the population overall but perhaps more common for people with long COVID, Horwitz says. “That’s hard even in a cohort study of thousands.”</p>



<p>But health records aren’t perfect: They depend on physicians logging that patients are having trouble sleeping or focusing, or that they’re exhausted. “The things people are complaining about, we’re really bad at writing down those diagnoses on the record,” Horwitz says. “So we miss that.” &nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>To account for health records’ deficiencies, Horowitz and colleagues are also directly studying thousands of people. Participants answer a questionnaire every three months so that the team can identify what kinds of symptoms people have and whether they’re getting better or worse.</p>



<p>Then blood, urine, stool and saliva samples can reveal what’s happening in the body. Tests on those samples can uncover if the coronavirus is still around and causing trouble, or if the immune system has learned to attack the body itself. Participants with abnormal test results will undergo additional, targeted testing.</p>



<p>“Unlike electronic health records where it’s hit or miss, like somebody might have had a CAT scan or might not, here we say, ‘OK, you have trouble breathing. We will take a look at your lungs,’” Horwitz says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study includes a range of participants: adults and kids, pregnant people, those currently with COVID-19 and people who died after having the disease.</p>



<p>Some of the potential risk factors that the team is looking for include autoimmune diseases and other viral infections. The list may grow as more people join the study. “We’re trying to balance the fishing versus making sure that we’re at least fishing for things that could be in the water,” Horwitz says.</p>



<p>Among short supply, though, are people who never caught the virus — important “controls” to highlight what’s different about people who got COVID-19.</p>



<p>So far, more than 7,000 people have signed up, and the group plans to recruit around 10,000 more. It’s a lot of data, but early results may soon start coming in.</p>



<p>“We’ll probably try to do an interim peek at those data this fall,” Horwitz says. “It’s tricky because we deliberately wanted to enroll 18,000 people so we would have enough power to really look at the things we care about. I don’t want to cheat and look too early, but we also know that there’s a lot of interest.”</p>



<h4>Striking similarities</h4>



<p>Some long COVID symptoms — brain fog, fatigue and trouble sleeping — mirror another illness: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS. Other long COVID symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness, fall in the category of nervous system disorders called dysautonomia. Similar symptoms could belie similar risk factors.</p>



<p>Yet potential risk factors for those conditions are largely missing from long COVID research, says Davis, who has had long COVID since March 2020. Among the possibilities that scientists are considering are things like Epstein-Barr virus, migraines and some autoimmune diseases.</p>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus could be a big one, Davis says. Infections last a lifetime because the virus can go into hiding in the body and possibly reemerge. That virus has been linked to ME/CFS for decades, though the connection is tenuous, Davis says.</p>

<p>Some early hints of a link between Epstein-Barr virus and long COVID already exist. Multiple studies have found evidence in blood samples from some long COVID patients that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276660v2">the immune system recently battled with Epstein-Barr virus</a>, which can cause infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by extreme fatigue. Other studies have <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00072-1?">found signs of the virus itself</a>. And in 2021, Davis and colleagues found that 40 out of 580 people with symptoms of long COVID who responded to an online survey reported having <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext">a current or recent Epstein-Barr virus infection</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With ME/CFS, it’s possible that another illness caused by a different virus triggers the Epstein-Barr virus, which then causes the fatigue syndrome. Given the parallels between that condition and long COVID, some scientists are wondering if the two are actually the same disease, with the coronavirus now known as one trigger.</p>



<p>Examining health conditions that raise the chances of long COVID could provide answers for both diseases, says Nancy Klimas, an immunologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. That’s in part because researchers can more easily identify people who developed lingering symptoms after a bout of COVID-19 compared with unknown infections that may precede ME/CFS.</p>



<p>Also, “there’s a huge difference in these two fields and it’s money,” Klimas says. She now has funding from the CDC to compare long COVID patients with people who have ME/CFS. The team hopes that physical exams and specialized tests will reveal whether the two diseases are indeed the same and be a step toward understanding the mechanisms behind the lingering symptoms.</p>



<p>Still, since long COVID as a whole encompasses such a wide range of symptoms, it will take time to uncover who is at risk of what.</p>



<p>If COVID-19 were just one disease impacting the lungs, heart or brain, the research might be easier, Horwitz says. “But we have to test everything.”</p>

<h3><b><i>‘’</i></b> <b><i>What is one piece of advice you would give to reviewers as an EBM overseeing peer review ?“ </i></b></h3>
<p>Here are their replies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise reviewers to think about how the manuscript at hand could be improved. The ultimate goal is to make published research better, such that the benefit to the public is maximized. I believe this can be achieved by being unbiased, open-minded, and thorough in assessing submitted work”. </span><strong>Dr Christiana Kartsonaki, senior statistician, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat every manuscript like treating your own paper. It’s vital to not only point out defects, but also to appreciate merits in each piece of work. Reviewers are not just making a choice between Accept and Reject. Instead, reviewers could offer valuable suggestions that are to the point and help authors improve the quality of the paper. Reviewers are not the opponents of authors, but teachers and friends who work side-by-side”. </span><strong>Prof Guo-wei Tu, Chief Physician and Associate Professor of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would advise reviewers to only commit to the review process if they have the time and required expertise for the specific manuscript. It is disheartening and inconvenient when reviewers agree to handle a manuscript but then don’t return any comments or provide very little feedback to the authors. The reviewing process should be constructive for the authors and it would be more beneficial if more highly experienced scientists were engaging with this”. </span><strong>Dr Stavroula Kanoni, Lecturer in Nutrigenetics and Cardiovascular Health, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts &amp; the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All reviewers, including me, are expected to abide by the ethical guidelines for peer reviewers published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). They are expected to spend adequate time to avoid missing anything. The history of medicine cannot forget the rejection of Sir Hans Adolf Krebs’ article by a prestigious journal in 1937, where he described the discovery which led him to obtain the Nobel prize. We should not let such egregious or even minor errors at lower scales be repeated”. </span><strong>Prof Elaheh Malakan Rad, Professor of Pediatric Interventional Cardiology, Children’s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would recommend reviewers pay more attention to the content of the paper and the validity of the proposed research rather than focus on the presentation. Some papers are written impeccably, but lack novelty or relevant research. I also suggest taking the right amount of time to review a paper since it is often the result of the authors&#8217; significant effort that must not be disregarded”. </span><strong>Prof Stafano Omboni, Director of the Italian Institute of Telemedicine, Italy and Professor of Cardiology, First Moscow State Medical University, Russia </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reviewers are precious to every Journal because their judgements and comments represent an important part in the review process of a manuscript. For this reason, fulfilling the task of Reviewers requires time and dedication in terms of knowledge and engagement. Exhaustive comments received quickly help the authors progress in their research. I would hence recommend potential Reviewers to take some courses to learn how to become experts in the job. Also our Journal offers some training courses available online”. </span><strong>Dr Aldo Bonaventura, Division of Internal Medicine, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese, Italy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would generally recommend learning how to become an expert in reviewing. This is not an easy task. There are a few training courses available online. We must be focused on both the scientific approach and the manuscript&#8217;s quality. The published data can impair clinical practice and bring suffering to our patients. We are responsible to uphold the faith of the people in public health and must be careful in decision-making to prevent any complications deteriorating our patients&#8217; quality of life”. </span><strong>Dr John Alexander Kharlamov, De Haar Research Task Force, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Tallinn, Estonia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The advice I would give to any reviewer is: accept reviewing a manuscript when you have specific expertise on the topic and the ability to appraise the methods and results presented critically. It is always ok to apologize and decline to review if you are unable to handle a manuscript, or because of conflict of interest. Another critical point is to try to finalize your recommendations in time. We have all been in these situations where our paper&#8217;s decision is delayed because of the one reviewer who did not complete his review. Please do not be that reviewer”. </span><strong>Dr Michael Megaly, Interventional Cardiology Fellow and Clinical Instructor Faculty, Banner University Medical Center and UA College of Medicine-Phoenix, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise a timely and constructive review for an efficient editorial process. Sometimes, the reviewers ignore adding a note to the editor, which might help make editorial decisions”. </span><strong>Dr Gaurav Sharma, early-career researcher, Advanced Imaging Research Centre, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember that reviewing means being at the service of the authors. The first question a reviewer should ask themselves is whether the paper is out of scope or unsuitable for publication in that particular journal. If this is the case, do not delay your decision, as this will only harm the authors’ effort to find the right journal for their work. If the paper and journal are a good (or at least a possible) match, take the time to analyze the paper thoroughly, before making your decision and give feedback that will improve the author’s work”. </span><strong>Dr Claudio Montalto, Cardiology resident, University of Pavia, Italy and Interventional Cardiology Fellow, Oxford University Hospital NHS Trust, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The peer-review process is critical for publishing exciting and authentic scientific findings, and the reviewer&#8217;s role is crucial here. Reviewer&#8217;s comments are the building blocks of the editorial board&#8217;s decision. My advice to all potential reviewers is: accomplish the assignment on time; keep an unbiased approach; provide comprehensive and constructive scientific comments in a friendly manner; highlight the significance of an article you review, thereby helping the associate editor make a final decision; inform the EBM if you cannot handle or understand any specific part of the manuscript, such as statistical and bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, if needed, reviewers should enroll in various training courses available online at various journals, including those available at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, to improve the skills required for best and ethical review practice”. </span><strong>Dr Gourav Bhardwaj, senior research investigator, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, USA</strong></li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/demon-duck-mihirung-australia-bird-fossil">Ancient ‘demon ducks’ may have been undone by their slow growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant flightless birds called mihirungs were the biggest birds to ever stride across what is now Australia. The animals, which weighed up to hundreds of kilograms, died out about 40,000 years ago. Now researchers might have a better idea why.</p>



<p>The birds may have grown and reproduced <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25047">too slowly to withstand</a> pressures from humans’ arrival on the continent, researchers report August 17 in the<em> Anatomical Record</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mihirungs are sometimes called “demon ducks” because of their great size and close evolutionary relationship with present-day waterfowl and game birds. The flightless, plant-eating birds lived for more than 20 million years.</p>





<p>Over that time, some species evolved into titans. Take Stirton’s thunderbird (<em>Dromornis stirtoni</em>). It lived about 7 million years ago, stood 3 meters tall and could exceed 500 kilograms in weight, making it the largest-known mihirung and a contender for the largest bird ever to live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most research on mihirungs has been on their anatomy and evolutionary relationships with living birds. Little is known about the animals’ biology, such as how long they took to grow and mature, says Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a paleobiologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Chinsamy-Turan and colleagues at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia took samples from 20 fossilized leg bones of<em> D. stirtoni</em>, from animals of varying life stages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even after millions of years of fossilization, the microscopic structure of fossil bones generally remains intact,” and it can be used to decipher important clues about extinct animals’ biology, Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team examined the thin bone slices under a microscope, detailing the presence or absence of growth marks. These marks provide information on how fast the bone grew while the birds were alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>D. stirtoni</em> took 15 years or more to reach full size, the team found. It probably became sexually mature a few years before that, based on the timing of a shift from rapidly growing bone to a slower-growing form that’s thought to be associated with reaching reproductive age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results differ from the team’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/5/219/htm">earlier analysis</a> of the bones of another mihirung, <em>Genyornis newtoni</em>. That species — the last-known mihirung — was less than half the size of <em>D. stirtoni</em>. It lived as recently as about 40,000 years ago and was a contemporary of the continent’s earliest human inhabitants. <em>G. newtoni</em> grew up much faster than its giant relative, reaching adult size in one to two years and growing a bit more in the following years and possibly reproducing then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difference in how fast mihirung species that were separated by millions of years developed may have been an evolved response to Australia developing a drier, more variable climate over the last few million years, the researchers say. When resources are unpredictable, growing and reproducing quickly can be advantageous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, that seeming pep in the developmental step of more recent mihirungs was still slower than that of the emus they lived alongside. Emus grow up quickly, reaching adult size in less than a year and reproducing not long after, laying large numbers of eggs.</p>



<p>This difference may explain why <em>G. newtoni</em> went extinct shortly after hungry humans arrived in Australia, yet emus continue to thrive today, the team says. Even though over millions of years, mihirungs as a group seem to have adapted to growing and reproducing quicker than they used to, it wasn’t enough to survive the arrival of humans, who probably ate the birds and their eggs, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“Slowly growing animals face dire consequences in terms of their reduced ability to recover from threats in their environments,” Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientists’ research on other giant, extinct, flightless birds thought to have met their end thanks to humans — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-reveal-what-it-was-grow-dodo">dodos of Mauritius</a> (<em>Raphus cucullatus</em>) and the largest of Madagascar’s elephant birds (<em>Vorombe titan</em>) — shows that they too grew relatively slowly (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/29/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is very interesting to see this pattern repeating again and again with many large, flightless bird groups,” says Thomas Cullen, a paleoecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>Modern ratite birds seem to be the exception in their ability to handle similar pressures, he says. Other ratites besides emus that have survived until the present day — such as cassowaries and ostriches — also grow and reproduce quickly (<em>SN: 4/25/14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">Physicists dispute a claim of detecting a black hole’s ‘photon ring’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first image of a black hole may conceal treasure — but physicists disagree about whether it’s been found.</p>



<p>A team of scientists say they’ve unearthed a photon ring, a thin halo of light around the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87. If real, the photon ring would provide a new probe of the black hole’s intense gravity. But other scientists dispute the claim. Despite multiple news headlines suggesting the photon ring has been found, many physicists remain unconvinced.</p>





<p>Unveiled in 2019 by scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a> revealed a doughnut-shaped glow from hot matter swirling around the black hole’s dark silhouette (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). But according to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a thinner ring should be superimposed on that thick doughnut. This ring is produced by photons, or particles of light, that orbit close to the black hole, slung around by the behemoth’s gravity before escaping and zinging toward Earth.</p>



<p>Thanks to this circumnavigation, the photons should provide “a fingerprint of gravity,” more clearly revealing the black hole’s properties, says astrophysicist Avery Broderick of the University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. He and his colleagues, a subset of scientists from the EHT collaboration, used a new method to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7c1d">tease out that fingerprint</a>, they report in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Creating images with EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">isn’t a simple point-and-shoot affair</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Researchers stitch together data from EHT’s squad of observatories scattered across the globe, using various computational techniques to reconstruct an image. Broderick and colleagues created a new black hole image assuming it featured both a diffuse emission and a thin ring. On three out of four days of observations, the data better matched an image with the added thin ring than one without the ring.</p>



<p>But that method has drawn harsh criticism. “The claim of a photon ring detection is preposterous,” says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>A main point of contention: The photon ring is brighter than expected, emitting around 60 percent of the light in the image. According to predictions, it should be more like 20 percent. “That’s a giant red flag,” says physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. More light should come from the black hole’s main glowing doughnut than from the thin photon ring.</p>



<p>This unexpected brightness, Broderick and colleagues say, occurs because some of the light from the main glow gets lumped in with the photon ring. So the ring’s apparent brightness doesn’t depend only on the light coming from the ring. The researchers note that the same effect appeared when testing the method on simulated data.</p>



<p>But that mishmash of purported photon ring light with other light doesn’t make for a very convincing detection, critics say. “If you want to claim that you’ve seen a photon ring, I think you have to do a better job than this,” says astrophysicist Dan Marrone of the University of Arizona, a member of the EHT collaboration who was not a coauthor on the new paper.</p>



<p>The new result suggests only that an added thin ring gives a better match to the data, Marrone says, not whether that shape is associated with the photon ring. So it raises the question of whether scientists are seeing a photon ring at all, or just picking out an unrelated structure in the image.</p>



<p>But Broderick argues that the features of the ring — the fact that its size and location are as expected and are consistent day-to-day — support the photon ring interpretation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a similar, independent analysis, Gralla and physicist Will Lockhart, also of the University of Arizona, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09989">find no evidence for a photon ring,</a> they report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org. Their analysis differed from Broderick and colleagues’ in part because it limited how bright the photon ring could be.</p>



<p>To convincingly detect the photon ring, some scientists propose adding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-could-help-spot-photon-ring-black-hole-ever-imaged">telescopes in space</a> to the EHT’s crew of observatories (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). The farther apart the telescopes in the network are, the finer details they may be able to pick out — potentially including the photon ring.</p>



<p>“If there were a photon ring detection,” Lupsasca says, “that would be the best thing in physics this year, if not for many years.”</p>

But how do the various environments and ever changing conditions faced by these small cetacean impact their genetic diversity and have they adapted to their specific environment? This <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution </em>seascape genomic study uses genome wide and environmental data at the population level to look at selective pressure, adaptive population structure and population diversity in the common dolphin in southern Australia. Four key variables are identified to have an impact on genomic variation:  sea surface temperature, primary productivity, current velocity and salinity. These data can in turn help to inform on the impact of specific factors such as pollution and assist in the conservation efforts. This study lead to the identification of five populations of common dolphin to be considered as priority for population management and conservation. As a near top predator, dolphins are key players in their environments and a vital part of the food chain. Thus, impacts from anthropogenic activities such as fisheries or climatic disruptions on dolphin populations could have long standing effects on the whole of the marine ecosystem.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12972" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-768x509.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-640x424.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Thailand is one of the world’s largest food exporter and sees a high usage of pesticides to boost productivity, especially herbicides.  The highest imported herbicide is Glyphosate. Glyphosate is a weak organic acid, often supplemented by adjuvants to increase its herbicidal properties. It is generally composed of an isopropylamine salt and a surfactant that is toxic to humans. Upon entrance into the body, Glyphosate is absorbed through the cell membrane and enters the bloodstream eventually spreading to the tissues and organs before being excreted by the body, primarily through urination and defecation.  Primary exposure to Glyphosate is through the skin and respiratory system while using herbicides and it has been linked to various illnesses, especially respiratory system afflictions. This <em>BMC Public Health </em>longitudinal pre-post study was conducted in maize farmer in Thailand using information from questionnaires, urine, blood samples and lung function assessment a day before and a day after glyphosate usage. As expected, exposure to glyphosate had negative impacts on oxidative stress, inflammation and lung function.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress can cause damage to cells and tissues and thus impact the body leading to increased inflammation. One of the by-product of oxidative damage is the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Upon oxidative stress, cells defend themselves by producing antioxidants in order to destroy damaging free radicals. Glutathione (GHS) plays a vital role in this process and acts to protect cells from oxidative stress. Glyphosate was shown to negatively impact the regulation of oxidative stress at different levels as exposure to glyphosate was shown to lead to a significant increase in the level of serum MDA and oxidative stress as well as a significant decrease in serum level of GHS. Furthermore, a statistically significant increase in inflammation was identified after glyphosate exposure as well as an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation which increases upon tissue injury, causes monocyte activation as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of complement. Last but not least, lung function was significantly decreased after application of glyphosate.</p>
<p>This study focused on the short term effects of acute exposure thus further studies on the long-term effect of glyphosate exposure are warranted.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of microbiome studies, little is known about the impact of the presence of bacterial DNA in human blood and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The association between chronic diseases and CVD has been extensively studied and a number of risk factors are known to be associated an increase in CVD mortality such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, physical activity, history of heart diseases etc… In this <em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em> case-cohort study spanning over nearly 10 years, blood samples from men of a mean age of 70 were collected and their microbiome analysed in order to investigate a putative association with CVD mortality. Over 80% of the blood samples collected contained bacterial DNA from a whole range of bacteria originating from the gut, skin, oral cavity or the environment. Three genera were significantly associated with CVD mortality but the two most prevalent genera isolated, <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> were not and are part of the commensal microbiota.  The presence of two genera in blood, <em>Kocuria</em> and <em>Enhydrobacter</em>, was associated with an increased CVD mortality whereas it was the opposite for the third genera, <em>Paracoccus</em>. Interestingly, these correlations were identified independently of other know health and lifestyle risk factors for CVD mortality. This study reflects on the risk through a lifetime as it looks at older men and it will be useful to inform on of which genera to pursue in future research projects.</p>

This condition was traditionally diagnosed upon observation of an increase in blood pressure and high level of proteins in urine. Recent studies have found an association between temperature and the risk of preeclampsia. Indeed, it has now been shown that the risk of preeclampsia increases for women who have conceived in warmth months and delivered in cold months based on the study of seasonal or monthly temperature data. In this <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> study, the effect of short-term temperature exposure on the risk of preeclampsia was investigated using daily temperature data. The authors reported that there was a significantly larger number of hospital admissions for preeclampsia on cold days than on hot ones. Indeed, the highest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was observed on days where the mean temperature was lower than 10°C. Furthermore, the lowest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was on days where the mean temperature was higher than 30°C. The lag effect of low temperature preeclampsia risk was also identified as a significant risk factor.  Thus the recommendation was that in low temperature, pregnant women should stay warm and pay attention to their blood pressure and go to the hospital if it raises. This information could be used in order for governments to increase publicity on the impact of low temperature on the risk of preeclampsia and thus help to reduce that risk.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12970" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Estuaries are changing environments characterised by large variations in salinity levels due to the mixture of marine and fluvial waters. Thus their inhabitants have had to develop strategies to adapt to such fluctuations. This <em>BMC Genomics</em> study set out to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for the strong salinity tolerance of <em>Scatophagus argus</em>, the spotted cat fish, a recently developed mariculture specie by looking at differentially expressed proteins. They uncovered that cellular ion regulation transport as well as ATP synthesis are key players in the osmoregulatory process of its specialised gills that act as the main osmoregulatory organ. These gills have developed different strategies to enable the fish to adapt to different salinity level. Under hypo saline conditions, Na+ efflux is maintained through Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) increased activity leading to a reduction in the intracellular osmotic pressure. Simultaneously, an increased NKA internalisation prevents excessive ion loss. Upon hypersaline stress, excess ions are excreted through active transport and reduced NKA activity resulting in an increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Thus this fish has developed different osmoregulatory strategies in order to handle hypoosmotic as well as hyperosmotic stresses and thus adapt to an environment subject to large fluctuations in salinity levels. These result provide valuable insights on <em>Scatophagus argus</em> and the strategies used by estuarine fishes that should prove helpful to the expansion of commercial aquaculture.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-infection-471-days-coronavirus-evolution-variants">The curious case of the 471-day coronavirus infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>As <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron subvariant BA.5</a> continues to drive the coronavirus’ spread in the United States, I’ve been thinking about what could come next. Omicron and its offshoots have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed.">topping the variant charts</a> since last winter. Before that, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta reigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have a few ideas for how new variants emerge. One involves people with persistent infections — people who test positive for the virus over a prolonged period of time. I’m going to tell you about the curious case of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 for at least 471 days and what can happen when infections roil away uncontrolled.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That lengthy infection first came onto epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh&#8217;s radar in the summer of 2021. His team had been analyzing coronavirus strains in patient samples from Yale New Haven Hospital when Grubaugh spotted something he had seen before. Known only as B.1.517, this version of the virus never got a name like delta or omicron, nor rampaged through communities quite like its infamous relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after springing up somewhere in North America in early 2020, B.1.517 tooled around in a handful of regions around the world, even sparking an outbreak in Australia. But after April 2021, B.1.517 seemed to sputter, one of the who-knows-how-many viral lineages that flare up and then eventually fizzle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.1.517 might have been long forgotten, shouldered aside by the latest variant to stake a claim in local communities. “And yet we were still seeing it,” Grubaugh says. Even after B.1.517 had petered out across the country, his team noticed it cropping up in patient samples. The same lineage, every few weeks, like clockwork, for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One clue was the samples’ specimen ID. The code on the B.1.517 samples was always the same, Grubaugh’s team noticed. They had all come from a single patient.</p>



<p>That patient, a person in their 60s with a history of cancer, relapsed in November of 2020. That was right around when they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After seeing B.1.517 show up again and again in their samples, Grubaugh worked with a clinician to get the patient’s permission to analyze their data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the patient has <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.22276868v1.full">remained infected for 471 days</a> (and counting), Grubaugh, Yale postdoctoral researcher Chrispin Chaguza and their team reported last month in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Because of deteriorating health and a desire to maintain their anonymity, the patient was not willing to be interviewed, and Grubaugh has no direct contact with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all those samples collected over all those days told an incredible tale of viral evolution. Over about 15 months, at least three genetically distinct versions of the virus had rapidly evolved inside the patient, the team’s analyses suggested.</p>



<p>Each version had dozens of mutations and seemed to coexist in the patient’s body. “Honestly, if any one of these were to emerge in a population and begin transmitting, we would be calling it a new variant,” Grubaugh says.</p>



<p>That scenario is probably rare, he says. After all, lots of prolonged infections have likely occurred during the pandemic, and only a handful of concerning variants have emerged. But the work does suggest that persistent viral infections can provide a playground for speedy evolutionary experimentation — perhaps taking advantage of weakened immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grubaugh’s work is “probably the most detailed look we’ve had at a single, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 so far,” says Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved with the work.</p>

<p>The study supports an earlier finding about a different immunocompromised patient — one with a persistent <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.22275533v1">omicron infection</a>. In that work, researchers documented the evolution of the virus over 12 weeks and showed that its descendant infected at least five other people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the studies lay out how such infections could potentially drive the emergence of the next omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am pretty well convinced that people with persistent infection are important sources of new variants,” Friedrich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who exactly develops these infections remains mysterious. Yes, the virus can pummel people with weakened immune systems, but “not every immunocompromised person develops a persistent infection,” says Viviana Simon, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who worked on the omicron infection study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, doctors and scientists have no idea how common these infections are. “We just don’t really have the numbers,” Simon says. That’s a huge gap for researchers, and something Mount Sinai’s <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/research/microbial-genomics-pathogen-surveillance">Pathogen Surveillance Program</a> is trying to address by analyzing real-time infection data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying patients with prolonged infections could also tell scientists where SARS-CoV-2 evolution is heading, Friedrich says. Just because the virus evolves within a person doesn’t mean it will spread to other people. But if certain viral mutations tend to arise in multiple people with persistent infections, that could hint that the next big variant might evolve in a similar way. Knowing more about these mutation patterns could help researchers forecast what’s to come, an important step in designing future coronavirus vaccine boosters.</p>

<p>Beyond viral forecasting, Grubaugh says identifying people with prolonged infections is important so doctors can provide care. “We need to give them access to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs,” he says. Those treatments could help patients clear their infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identifying persistent infections is easier said than done, he points out. Many places in the world aren’t set up to spot these infections and don’t have access to vaccines or treatments. And even when these are available, some patients opt out. The patient in Grubaugh’s study received a monoclonal antibody infusion about 100 days into their infection, then refused all other treatments. They have not been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the patient remained infectious over the course of the study, their variants never spread to the community, as far as Grubaugh knows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while untreated chronic infections might spawn new variants, they could emerge in other ways, too, like from animals infected with the virus, from person-to-person transmission in groups of people scientists haven’t been monitoring, or from “something else that maybe none of us has thought of yet,” he says. “SARS-CoV-2 has continued to surprise us with its evolution.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-anus-saccorhytus-coronarius-evolution">This bizarre ancient critter has been kicked out of a group that includes humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>No ifs, ands or butts about it: A teeny roughly 530-million-year-old critter that lacks an anus is not, as previously thought, the oldest member of a wide-ranging animal group that includes everything from starfish to humans.</p>



<p>Despite its absent anus, <em>Saccorhytus coronarius</em> had no shortage of holes on its wrinkly potato-shaped body, including a ring of small openings around its gaping mouth. Previously, those holes had been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinhead-sized-sea-creature-was-bag-mouth">identified as an early version of gill slits</a>, typically used for respiration (<em>SN: 2/3/17</em>). Gill slits are commonly found in deuterostomes, so their presence seemingly nailed the critter’s spot on the animal family tree.</p>





<p>But a new 3-D reconstruction of the half-millimeter-long species based on fossil imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05107-z">shows those holes are instead remnants of broken spines</a>, researchers report August 17 in <em>Nature</em>. The identification of the spines helped shift the creature into a group with arthropods and nematodes, called Ecdysozoa.</p>



<p>After millions of years, fossils can look very different from the original specimens, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">makes it challenging to identify biological features</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/22</em>). Most <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils have been flattened “like a very sad balloon that&#8217;s collapsed in on itself,” says paleontologist Philip Donoghue of the University of Bristol in England. The 3-D reconstruction brings <em>S. coronarius</em> to life — even if it does look something like an angry minion, he says.</p>



<p>Donoghue and his colleagues took X-rays of many <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils representing different stages of the organisms’ decay. The images revealed that an inner skin layer once pushed through pores and extended outward, forming spines. During fossilization, that inner layer was lost, and the holes were left behind.</p>



<p>While the spines pretty much lock <em>S. coronarius </em>into its new group, a puzzle remains: the absent anus. It’s not inherently weird —&nbsp;the absence has evolved independently in many species such as jellyfish, which vomit their food waste. But both deuterostomes and ecdysozoans usually have anuses, making <em>S. coronarius </em>an uncomfortable fit in either group.</p>



<p>Still, “if you haven&#8217;t got an anus,” Donoghue jokes, “you&#8217;re not going to be very comfortable anywhere.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">The Tonga eruption may have spawned a tsunami as tall as the Statue of Liberty</a></h4>

              
                <p>The massive Tonga eruption generated a set of planet-circling tsunamis that may have started out as a single mound of water roughly the height of the Statue of Liberty.</p>



<p>What’s more, the explosive eruption triggered an immense atmospheric shock wave that spawned <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822014810">a second set of especially fast-moving tsunamis</a>, a rare phenomenon that can complicate early warnings for these oft-destructive waves, researchers report in the October <em>Ocean Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano erupted</a> in the South Pacific in January, it displaced a large volume of water upward, says Mohammad Heidarzadeh, a civil engineer at the University of Bath in England (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). The water in that colossal mound later “ran downhill,” as fluids tend to do, to generate the initial set of tsunamis.</p>





<p>To estimate the original size of the mound, Heidarzadeh and his team used computer simulations, as well as data from deep-ocean instruments and coastal tide gauges within about 1,500 kilometers of the eruption, many of them in or near New Zealand. The arrival times of tsunami waves, as well as their sizes, at those locations were key pieces of data, Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>The team analyzed nine possibilities for the initial wave, each of which was shaped like a baseball pitcher’s mound and had a distinct height and diameter. The best fit to the real-world data came from a mound of water a whopping 90 meters tall and 12 kilometers in diameter, the researchers report.</p>



<p>That initial wave would have contained an estimated 6.6 cubic kilometers of water. “This was a really large tsunami,” Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>Despite starting out about nine times as tall as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-waves-2">the tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region of Japan</a> in 2011, the Tongan tsunamis killed only five people and caused about $90 million in damage, largely because of their remote source (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>).</p>



<p>Another unusual aspect of the Tongan eruption is the second set of tsunamis generated by a strong atmospheric pressure wave.</p>



<p>That pressure pulse resulted from a steam explosion that occurred when a large volume of seawater infiltrated the hot magma chamber beneath the erupting volcano. As the pressure wave raced across the ocean’s surface at speeds exceeding 300 meters per second, it pushed water ahead of it, creating tsunamis, Heidarzadeh explains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082522_sp_tonga-explosion_inline1.gif" alt="animation showing the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and the accompanying pressure wave, like a huge ripple" class="wp-image-3116693" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116693">The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano also triggered an atmospheric pressure wave that in turn generated tsunamis that traveled quicker than expected.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116693">NASA Earth Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Along many coastlines, including some in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, these pressure wave–generated tsunamis arrived hours ahead of the gravity-driven waves spreading from the 90-meter-tall mound of water. Gravity-driven tsunami waves typically travel across the deepest parts of the ocean, far from continents, at speeds between 100 and 220 meters per second. When the waves reach shallow waters near shore, the waves slow, water stacks up and then strikes shore, where destruction occurs.</p>



<p>Pressure wave–generated tsunamis have been reported for only one other volcanic eruption: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/krakatau-1883-shock-felt-round-world">the 1883 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/83</em>).</p>



<p>Those quicker-than-expected arrival times — plus the fact that the pressure-wave tsunamis for the Tongan eruption were comparable in size with the gravity-driven ones — could complicate early warnings for these tsunamis. That’s concerning, Heiderzadeh says.</p>



<p>One way to address the issue would be to install instruments that measure atmospheric pressure with the deep-sea equipment already in place to detect tsunamis, says Hermann Fritz, a tsunami scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>With that setup, scientists would be able to discern if a passing tsunami is associated with a pressure pulse, thus providing a clue in real time about how fast the tsunami wave might be traveling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">COVID-19 gave new urgency to the science of restoring smell</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the juice that tipped him off. At lunch, Ícaro de A.T. Pires found the flavor of his grape juice muted, flattened into just water with sugar. There was no grape goodness. “I stopped eating lunch and went to the bathroom to try to smell the toothpaste and shampoo,” says Pires, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Hospital IPO in Curitiba, Brazil. “I realized then that I couldn’t smell anything.”</p>



<p>Pires was about three days into COVID-19 symptoms when his sense of smell vanished, an absence that left a mark on his days. On a trip to the beach two months later, he couldn’t smell the sea. “This was always a smell that brought me good memories and sensations,” Pires says. “The fact that I didn’t feel it made me realize how many things in my day weren’t as fun as before. Smell can connect to our emotions like no other sense can.”<br><br>As SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, ripped across the globe, it stole the sense of smell away from millions of people, leaving them with a condition called anosmia. Early in the pandemic, when Pires’ juice turned to water, that olfactory theft became one of the quickest ways to signal a COVID-19 infection. With time, most people who lost smell recover the sense. Pires, for one, has slowly regained a large part of his sense of smell. But that’s not the case for everyone.</p>





<p>About 5.6 percent of people with post–COVID-19 smell loss (or the closely related taste loss) are still <a></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-069503">not able to smell or taste normally six months later</a>, a recent analysis of 18 studies suggests. The number, reported in the July 30 <em>British Medical Journal</em>, seems small. But when considering the estimated 550 million cases and counting of COVID-19 around the world, it adds up.</p>



<p>Scientists are searching for ways to hasten olfactory healing. Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have a better idea of how many people are affected and how long it seems to last. Yet when it comes to ways to rewire the sense of smell, the state of the science isn’t coming up roses.</p>



<p>A method called olfactory training, or smell training, has shown promise, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom. The technique has been around for a while; the coronavirus isn’t the first ailment to snatch away smell. But with newfound pressure from people affected by COVID-19, olfactory training and a host of other newer treatments are now getting a lot more attention.</p>



<p>The pandemic has brought increased attention to smell loss. “If we have to provide a silver lining, COVID is pushing the science at a speed that’s never happened before,” says Valentina Parma, an olfactory researcher and assistant director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “But,” she cautions, “we are really far from a solution.”</p>



<h4>Nasal attack</h4>



<p>Compared with sight or hearing, the sense of smell can seem like an afterthought. But losing it can affect people deeply. “Your world really changes if you lose the sense of smell, in ways that are usually worse,” Parma says. The smell of a baby’s head, a buttery curry or the sharp salty sea can all add emotional meaning to experiences. Smells can also warn of danger, such as the rotten egg stench that signals a natural gas leak.</p>



<p>As an ear, nose and throat doctor, Pires recalls a deaf patient who lost her sense of smell after COVID-19 and enrolled in a clinical trial that he and colleagues conducted on smell training. She worked in a perfumery company — her sense of smell was crucial to her job and her life. “At the first appointment, she said, with tears in her eyes, that it felt like she wasn’t living,” Pires recalls.</p>



<p>Unlike the cells that detect color or sound, the cells that sense smell can replenish themselves. Stem cells in the nose are constantly pumping out new smell-sensing cells. Called olfactory sensory neurons, these cells are dotted with molecular nets that snag specific odor molecules that waft into the nose. Once activated, these cells send messages through the skull and into the brain.</p>



<p>Because of their nasal neighborhood, olfactory sensory neurons are exposed to the hazards of the environment. “They may be covered with a little layer of mucus, but they’re sitting out there being constantly bombarded with bacteria and viruses and pollutants and who knows what else,” says Steven Munger, a chemosensory neuroscientist at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville.</p>



<p>Exactly how SARS-CoV-2 damages the smell system isn’t clear. But recent studies suggest the virus’s assault is indirect. The virus can infect and kill nose support cells called sustentacular cells, which are thought to help keep olfactory neurons happy and fed by delivering glucose and maintaining the right salt balance. That attack can inflame the olfactory epithelium, the layers of cells that line parts of the nasal cavity.</p>



<p>Once this tissue is riled up, the olfactory sensory neurons <a></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00135-0">get wonky</a>, even though the cells themselves haven’t been attacked. After an infection and ensuing inflammation, these neurons slow down the production of their odor-catching nets, a decrease that could blind themselves to odor molecules, scientists reported in the March 17 <em>Cell</em>.</p>



<p>With time, the inflammation settles down, and the olfactory sensory neurons can get back to their usual jobs, researchers suspect. “We do think that for post-viral smell disorders, the most common way to recover function is going to be spontaneous recovery,” Munger says. But in some people, this process doesn’t happen quickly, if ever.</p>



<p>That’s where smell training comes in.</p>



<h4>A nose workout</h4>



<p>One of the only therapies that exists, smell training is quite simple — a good old-fashioned nose workout. It involves deeply smelling four scents (usually rose, eucalyptus, lemon and cloves) for 30 seconds apiece, twice a day for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one study, 40 people who had smell disorders came away from the training with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.20101">improved smelling abilities</a>, on average, compared with 16 people who didn’t do the training, olfactory researcher Thomas Hummel and his colleagues reported in the March 2009 <em>Laryngoscope</em>.</p>



<p>Since then, the bulk of studies has shown that the method helps between 30 and 60 percent of the people who try it, says Hummel, of Technische Universität Dresden in Germany. His view is that the method can help some people, “but it does not work in everybody.”</p>



<p>One of the nice things is that there are no harmful side effects, Hummel says. That’s “the charming side of it.” But to do the training correctly takes discipline and stamina. “If you don’t do it regularly, and you give up after 14 days, this is futile,” he says.</p>



<p>Pires in his recent trial had hoped to speed up the process, which usually takes three months, by adding four more odors to the regimen. For four weeks, 80 participants received either four or eight smells. Both groups improved, but <a></a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19458924221113124">there was no difference between the two groups</a>, the researchers reported July 21 in the <em>American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not known how the technique works in the people it seems to help. It could be that it focuses people’s attention on faint smells; it could be stimulating the growth of replacement cells; it could be strengthening some pathways in the brain. Data from other animals suggest that such training can increase the number of olfactory sensory neurons, Hummel says.</p>



<p>Overall, this nose boot camp may be a possible approach for people to try, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom, Munger says. “In my view, it’s very important to be up front with patients about the very real possibility this therapy may not lead to a restoration of smell, even if they and their doctor feel it is worth trying,” he says. “I am not trying to discourage people here, but I also think we need to be very careful not to give unwarranted promises.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smell training doesn’t come with harmful biological side effects, but it can induce frustration if it doesn’t work, Parma says. In her practice, “I have been talking to a lot of people who say, ‘I did it every day for six months, twice a day for 10 minutes. I met in groups with other people, so we kept each other accountable, and I did that for six months. And it didn’t work for me.’” She adds, “I would want to address the frustration that this induces in patients.”</p>



<h4>Beyond training</h4>



<p>Other potential treatments are coming under scrutiny, such as steroids, omega-3 supplements, growth factors and vitamins A and E, all of which might encourage the recovery of the nasal epithelium.</p>



<p>More futuristic remedies are also in early stages of research. These include epithelial transplants designed to boost olfactory stem cells, treatments with platelet-rich plasma to curb inflammation and promote healing, and even an “electronic nose” that would detect odor molecules and stimulate the brain directly. This cyborg-smelling system takes inspiration from cochlear implants for hearing and retinal implants for vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many people, the sense of smell is appreciated only after it’s gone, Parma says, an apathy that’s illustrated in stark terms by a recent study of about 400 people. The vast majority of respondents — nearly 85 percent — would rather give up their sense of smell than sight or hearing. About 19 percent of respondents said they would prefer to give up their sense of smell than their cell phone. The survey results “dramatically illustrate the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/3">negligible value</a> people place on their sense of smell,” researchers wrote in the March <em>Brain Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Even as a doctor who treats people with smell loss, Pires has a newfound fondness for a good whiff. “Having lost it for a while made me appreciate it even more.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-atmosphere">The James Webb telescope spotted CO2 in an exoplanet’s atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has gotten the first sniff of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet in another solar system.</p>



<p>“It’s incontrovertible. It’s there. It’s definitely there,” says planetary scientist and study coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “There have been hints of carbon dioxide in previous observations, but never confirmed to such an extent.”</p>



<p>The finding, submitted to arXiv.org on August 24, marks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11692">the first detailed scientific result published from the new telescope</a>. It also points the way to finding the same greenhouse gas in the atmospheres of smaller, rockier planets that are more like Earth.</p>





<p>The planet, dubbed WASP-39b, is huge and puffy. It’s a bit wider than Jupiter and about as massive as Saturn. And it orbits its star every four Earth days, making it scorching hot. Those features make it a terrible place to search for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">evidence of extraterrestrial life</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>). But that combination of puffy atmosphere and frequent passes in front of its star makes it easy to observe, a perfect planet to put the new telescope through its paces.</p>



<p>James Webb, or JWST, launched in December 2021 and released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first images in July 2022</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). For about eight hours in July, the telescope observed starlight that filtered through the planet’s thick atmosphere as the planet crossed between its star and JWST. As it did, molecules of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbed specific wavelengths of that starlight. </p>



<p>Previous observations of WASP-39b with NASA’s now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope had detected just a whiff of absorption at that same wavelength. But it wasn’t enough to convince astronomers that carbon dioxide was really there.</p>



<p>“I would not have bet more than a beer, at most a six pack, on that weird tentative hint of carbon dioxide from Spitzer,” says astronomer Nicolas Cowan of McGill University in Montreal, who was not involved with the new study. The JWST detection, on the other hand, “is rock solid,” he says. “I wouldn’t bet my firstborn because I love him too much. But I would bet a nice vacation.”</p>



<p>The JWST data also showed an extra bit of absorption at wavelengths close to those absorbed by carbon dioxide. “It’s a mystery molecule,” says astronomer Natalie Batalha of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the team behind the observation. “We have several suspects that we are interrogating.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Carbon dioxide bump</h3>



<p>The spectrum of light that filtered through the atmosphere of exoplanet WASP-39 b shows strong evidence for containing carbon dioxide. The large bump in the middle of the spectrum shows that the planet’s atmosphere absorbed light with wavelengths around 4.3 micrometers — a clear sign of CO<sub>2</sub>. A smaller bump (shown as three dots above the best-fit line) to the left of the CO<sub>2</sub>, around 4 micrometers, could represent a mystery molecule.</p>

<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet’s atmosphere can reveal details about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">how the planet formed</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>). If the planet was bombarded with asteroids, that could have brought in more carbon and enriched the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. If radiation from the star stripped away some of the planet atmosphere’s lighter elements, that could make it appear richer in carbon dioxide too.</p>



<p>Despite needing a telescope as powerful as JWST to detect it, carbon dioxide might be in atmospheres all over the galaxy, hiding in plain sight. “Carbon dioxide is one of the few molecules that is present in the atmospheres of all solar system planets that have atmospheres,” Batalha says. “It’s your front-line molecule.”</p>



<p>Eventually, astronomers hope to use JWST to find carbon dioxide and other molecules in the atmospheres of small rocky planets, like the ones <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trappist-1-earth-sized-planets-top-science-stories-2017-yir">orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). Some of those planets, at just the right distances from their star to sustain liquid water, might be good places to look for signs of life. It&#8217;s yet to be seen whether JWST will detect those signs of life, but it will be able to detect carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“My first thought when I saw these data was, ‘Wow, this is gonna work,’” Batalha says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deaths-head-hawkmoths-fly-migration-navigate-dark-airplane">How death’s-head hawkmoths manage to fly straight for miles in the dark</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sitting alone in the cockpit of a small biplane, Martin Wikelski listens for the pings of a machine by his side. The sonic beacons help the ecologist stalk death’s-head hawkmoths (<em>Acherontia</em> <em>atropos</em>) fluttering across the dark skies above Konstanz, Germany —&nbsp;about 80 kilometers north of the Swiss Alps.</p>



<p>The moths, nicknamed for the skull-and-crossbones pattern on their backs, migrate thousands of kilometers between northern Africa and the Alps during the spring and fall. Many migratory insects go where the wind takes them, says Ring Carde, an entomologist at the University of California, Riverside who is not a member of Wikelski’s team. Death’s-head hawkmoths appear to be anything but typical.</p>



<p>“When I follow them with a plane, I use very little gas,” says Wikelski, of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Munich. “That shows me that they are supposedly choosing directions or areas that are probably supported by a little bit of updraft.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="360" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2.jpg" alt="map showing the path Martin Wikelski in his plane as he tracked a death’s-head hawkmoth migrating south across the Alps from Germany" class="wp-image-3116622" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline2-330x175.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116622">The purple line marks the path ecologist Martin Wikelski followed in his biplane as he tracked a death’s-head hawkmoth migrating south from Kostanz, Germany, into the Alps.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116622">Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A new analysis of data collected from 14 death’s-head hawkmoths suggest that these insects indeed pilot themselves, possibly relying in part on an internal compass attuned to Earth’s magnetic field. The moths not only <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn1663">fly along a straight path</a>, they also stay the course even when winds change, Wikelski and colleagues report August 11 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The findings could help predict how the moths’ flight paths might shift as the globe continues warming, Wikelski says. Like many animals, death’s-head hawkmoths will probably move north in search of cooler temperatures, he suspects.</p>



<p>To keep tabs on the moths, Wikelski’s team glued radio transmitters to their backs, which is easier to do than one might expect. “Death’s-head hawkmoths are totally cool,” Wikelski says. They’re also huge. Weighing as much as three jellybeans, the moths are the largest in Europe. That makes attaching the tiny tags a cinch, though the moths don’t like it very much. “They talk to you, they shout at you a little bit,” he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1.jpg" alt="close-up image of a death’s-head hawkmoth as a researcher places a tracker on its back" class="wp-image-3116623" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/081722_ao_hawkmoth_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116623">Researchers tracked death’s-head hawkmoths like this one by gluing radio transmitters to the insects’ backs.

<p>Once the researchers set the newly tagged and slightly annoyed moths free, Wikelski took off after them in a plane. As the insects flew south toward the Alps, a device onboard pinged the transmitters at a frequency related to the moths’ distance from the plane.</p>



<p>While detailed tracking of eight of the moths allowed him to follow the insects for about 63 kilometers on average, he pursued one for just under 90 kilometers. That’s the longest distance that an insect has been continuously tracked, he says. “It’s outrageously crazy work,” he says of the night flights at low altitude. “It’s also a little dangerous and it&#8217;s just showing it&#8217;s possible.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">NASA’s Artemis I mission sets the stage for our return to the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Artemis I blasts off into the sky over Florida, it may launch a new era of lunar science and exploration with it.</p>



<p>The NASA mission, now scheduled to launch in September after a scrubbed first attempt, is the first of three planned flights aimed at landing humans on the moon for the first time since 1972. No astronauts will fly on the upcoming mission. But the flight marks the first test of the technology — the rocket, the spacesuits, the watery return to Earth — that will ultimately take people, including the first woman and the first astronaut of color, to the lunar surface.</p>





<p>The test includes the first flight of NASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, and its Orion spacecraft, a rocket and crew capsule that have been decades in the making. These craft have been delayed, blown through their budgets and been threatened with cancellation more than once. Even within the spaceflight community, a lot of people feared they would never fly.</p>



<p>To see a human-capable moon rocket finally on the launchpad is “pretty astonishing,” says Casey Dreier, a Seattle-based space policy expert at the Planetary Society. “This is a reality that most of us alive on Earth today have never experienced.”</p>



<p>And if the Artemis program works, opportunities for science will follow.</p>



<p>“Because humans have to come back, alive, you have a huge opportunity to bring samples back with you,” Dreier says. Sending human astronauts may be a wedge to open the door for pure learning.</p>



<h4>The launch</h4>



<p>Artemis I was slated to lift off on August 29 at 8:33 a.m. EDT, but trouble with one if its engines led NASA to cancel that attempt. The next opportunity to launch is now September 3 at 2:17 p.m. EDT.</p>



<p>When it does blast off, the SLS rocket will lift Orion into space, where the crew capsule will separate from the rocket and continue to an orbit around the moon. After circling the moon for about two weeks, Orion will slingshot back to Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego. The whole mission will last about 42 days.</p>



<p>Orion will stay in space longer than any other human-rated spacecraft has without docking to another spaceship, like the International Space Station. At its closest approach, the spacecraft will fly about 100 kilometers above the lunar surface. It will also go up to 64,000 kilometers past the moon, farther from Earth than any spacecraft built for humans. The previous record, set by Apollo 13 in 1970, was 16,000 kilometers beyond the far side of the moon.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Lunar liaison</h3>



<p>The Orion spacecraft’s outbound trajectory (green) will take it about 100 kilometers from the moon’s surface (<strong>1</strong>) before looping around and going into lunar orbit (<strong>2</strong>). After about two weeks circling the moon (gray), the capsule will leave lunar orbit (<strong>3</strong>) and start its return trip to Earth (blue). On its way back, the spacecraft will fire its engine, buzz the moon one more time (<strong>4</strong>) and then coast back to Earth for a watery landing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3116587" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082322_lg_artemis_inline1-330x186.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3116587">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>The main goal of the mission is to prove that everything works. That includes Orion’s heat shield, which will need to protect astronauts as the capsule comes screaming through Earth’s atmosphere at 40,000 kilometers per hour and heats up to more than 2700° Celsius on its return trip. It also includes the procedure for retrieving the capsule and its crew and cargo after splashdown.</p>



<p>Even though it has no astronauts, the mission won’t be flying empty. Just beneath the Orion capsule are 10 CubeSats, small, simple spacecraft each about the size of a shoebox. After Orion separates from the SLS rocket, those CubeSats will go their separate ways to study the moon, the radiation environment in space and the effects of that radiation on organisms like yeast. One CubeSat will unfurl a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-sunshine">solar sail</a> and take off to explore a near-Earth asteroid (<em>SN: 8/26/11</em>).</p>



<h4>The “crew”</h4>



<p>Inside the Orion capsule ride three humanoid passengers. In the commander’s seat is faux astronaut Moonikin Campos, named for Arturo Campos, a NASA engineer who played a key role in returning the Apollo 13 moon mission safely to Earth after its in-flight disaster in 1970. The “moonikin” — a mashup of <em>moon</em> and <em>manikin </em>— is based on a firefighter training rescue manikin, says NASA engineer Dustin Gohmert. &nbsp;Moonikin Campos will be wearing the new flight suit that was designed for the Artemis missions.</p>

<p>The spacesuit is like a personalized spacecraft, says Gohmert, of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. It’s meant to be worn during takeoff, landing and any time there is an emergency in the cabin. The suit may look familiar to anyone who watched space shuttle launches, Gohmert says, because it does a very similar job: “It’s an orange suit that acts like a balloon that’s shaped like your body.”</p>



<p>The main difference is that the Orion suit, plus the accompanying helmet, seat and connection to the Orion spacecraft itself, are designed to keep a crew member alive for up to six days, the time it could take to get back to Earth if something goes wrong in deep space. Astronauts visiting the International Space Station, by contrast, were never more than a few hours from Earth.</p>



<p>To help make that week tolerable, each suit will be custom fit to the astronaut. “I’d like to say the word ‘comfort,’ but that’s a difficult word to use,” Gohmert says. “Nothing will be comfortable about six days in a spacesuit, no matter what you do.”</p>



<p>The suit and spacecraft will provide the astronauts with oxygen and scrub the astronauts’ air of carbon dioxide. The suit will also have a tube for the astronauts to eat liquid food and a way for them to collect urine and feces, although Moonikin Campos won’t test those aspects. He will be equipped with radiation sensors, while his seat will have sensors to detect acceleration and vibration throughout the mission.</p>

<p>The suit, helmet and seat all take safety lessons from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/after-tragedy">space shuttle Columbia disaster</a>, Gohmert says (<em>SN: 9/22/2003</em>). A junior engineer at the time, Gohmert worked on the suits the Columbia astronauts wore and saw the seven-member crew off to the launchpad. “It was a pivotal point for all of us, of course, who were there at the time,” he says. “If we didn’t take lessons from that, we wouldn’t be doing them justice.”</p>



<p>Moonikin Campos will be accompanied by a pair of mockup female torsos named Helga and Zohar. Their mission is to report back on space risks that are unique to female bodies, which have never been near the moon. NASA plans to send a woman on the first crewed Artemis flight, and women have different cancer risks from space radiation than men.</p>

<p>The two torsos are figures used in medicine called anthropomorphic phantoms, which are made from materials that simulate human bone, tissue and organs. “They are in principle identical twins,” said physicist Thomas Berger of the German Aerospace Center in Cologne in a briefing on August 17. But Zohar — whose name means “light” or “radiance” in Hebrew — will wear a radiation protection vest provided by the Israel Space Agency and the private company StemRad, based in Tampa, Fla.</p>



<p>The vest is made of a polymer designed to deflect protons that the sun releases during solar storms and has more shielding over radiation-sensitive organs like breasts and ovaries. Each phantom will also carry more than 6,000 small radiation detectors to build a 3-D picture of the dose of charged particles a female astronaut might receive on a trip to the moon and back. Comparing the radiation levels each phantom receives will help refine the vest’s design for future astronauts.</p>



<p>Orion will also carry two other nonhuman passengers — the British stop motion television character&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ESA_names_first_astronaut_to_fly_on_the_Artemis_I_lunar_mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaun the sheep</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/snoopy-to-fly-on-nasas-artemis-i-moon-mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoopy</a>, who will serve as an indicator of zero gravity.</p>



<h4>The past and the future</h4>



<p>SLS and Orion have had a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01253-6">checkered history</a>. The program goes back to 2004, when President George W. Bush proposed sending astronauts to the moon and then to Mars. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled that plan, and then in 2017 President Donald Trump directed NASA to retrain its sights on the moon.</p>



<p>All the while, Congress continued to fund the development of the SLS rocket. Originally, SLS was supposed to cost $6 billion and fly in 2016. It has so far cost $23 billion on the eve of its launch in 2022.</p>



<p>“The rhetoric has flip-flopped a bunch,” Dreier says, as political leaders kept changing their vision for NASA’s direction. “But if you look at the actual programs, very little changed. … The whole time, the money was going to a moon rocket and a moon capsule.”</p>



<p>The next Artemis mission, Artemis II, is scheduled to launch in 2024 and take astronauts — real, live, human astronauts — around the moon but not to its surface.</p>



<p>Artemis III will be the moon landing mission. On August 19, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-identifies-candidate-regions-for-landing-next-americans-on-moon/">NASA announced 13 candidate landing regions</a>, all near the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-about-visit-uncharted-territory-moon">moon’s south pole</a>, an intriguing spot that has never been visited by humans (<em>SN: 11/11/18</em>). That mission is scheduled to launch in 2025, but there are still a lot of untested elements. Those include the actual lander, which will be built by SpaceX.</p>



<p>There are still a lot of things that can go wrong and a long way to go. But the Artemis I launch is an optimistic dawn for lunar science nevertheless. “The whole [human spaceflight] system has all been shifting to point at the moon,” Dreier says. “I think that’s profoundly exciting. There’s going to be really interesting lessons that happen no matter what comes out of this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">‘Chameleon’ forces remain elusive in a new dark energy experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>A chameleon-like force that shifts its nature based on its environment could explain a major physics quandary: how the mysterious substance called dark energy is compelling the cosmos to expand faster and faster. But a new experiment <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01706-9">casts doubt</a> on some chameleon theories, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature Physics</em>.</p>



<p>The chameleon force would be a fifth type of force beyond the basic four: gravitational, strong, weak and electromagnetic. And like a chameleon changing its colors, the hypothetical fifth force would morph depending on the density of its surroundings. In dense environments like Earth, this fifth force would be feeble, camouflaging its effects. In the sparseness of space, the force would be stronger and long-ranged.</p>





<p>This force would result from a chameleon field — an addition to the known fields in physics, such as electric, magnetic and gravitational fields. A chameleon field with these morphing properties could drive the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">accelerating expansion of the universe</a> without disagreeing with measurements on Earth.</p>



<p>But it’s a challenge to suss out such a changeling force. On Earth, says astrophysicist Jianhua He of Nanjing University in China, “it’s very, very tiny. That’s the most difficult part.”</p>



<p>So He and colleagues designed a detector to search for a subtle fifth force. A wheel with plastic films attached spins past another film sitting on a magnetically levitated piece of graphite. If a chameleon force really exists, the films spinning by would cause a periodic force on the levitating plastic, pulling it up and down. (Gravity also acts this way, but thanks to the device’s design, it should be much weaker than a chameleon force.)</p>



<p>The team was able to rule out a category of chameleon theories. In the future, the researchers hope to improve their results by chilling their device to allow for more sensitive measurements.</p>

          <p>At PLOS I&rsquo;m part of the Executive Team and lead the Publishing &amp; Partnerships Team. As part of the Executive Team my role is to be a strategic thought partner for the CEO and other team leaders. In leading the Publishing &amp; Partnerships Team, my focus is ensuring the PLOS journals reflect the interests of the communities they serve,&nbsp; facilitate the co-creation of paths to Open Science while ensuring PLOS&rsquo; financial sustainability to continue our mission. This includes developing new business models to enable more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access and Open Science, developing new publications that enable Open Science communities of practice, and developing our relationships and networks with communities in different countries and regions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>Doing this work takes a great team and my role is to both support the leaders in my group and to raise questions and suggestions so that we work towards the best outcomes. It&rsquo;s important to me that we understand the challenges that face our communities and listen so that we can work with them to develop solutions.</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiatives have you been involved with to help lead others in the way research is communicated?</strong></p>



<p>Quite a few! I can think of a few highlights. I&rsquo;ve worked alongside <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-changing-the-landscape-to-make-open-access-more-affordable/">Sara </a>and colleagues across PLOS to develop our new business models, which provide alternatives to APCs,removing barriers to inclusion in sharing research while addressing cost inflation for research-intensive institutions which is vital to allow a greater diversity of voices and research findings to be represented. Another highlight for me was the development and launch of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new publishing venues</a> to enable co-creation of Open Science communities of practice in fields that are vital to addressing the challenges society faces globally,&nbsp; including climate, public health and sustainability. And I work with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-collaborating-globally-to-build-trust-in-science/">Roheena</a> and the regional publishing directors to developour networks in different regions so that we can better understand the cultural, political and economic contexts in which our communities are working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My contribution is only one small part of each of these exciting initiatives and it&rsquo;s great to have the opportunity to be involved in so many projects that are not only reshaping PLOS, but have the potential to deepen our understanding of researchers&rsquo; needs globally and drive necessary change in science communicationt</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has from the outset been focused on catalyzing broad-scale systemic change. In order to achieve this we need to directly address the perception of objectivity and empirical research, through focusing on driving Open Science and addressing the cultural and economic contexts that influence research and research-sharing in science and medicine.&nbsp; Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.&nbsp; Without equitable participation in knowledge-sharing,&nbsp; hearing the voices that have been missing, and a willingness to experiment and explore, we will fall short of the goal of Open Science to increase the benefits of research for society globally.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>I believe that a great team, or group, can achieve more than any one individual which is very much in line with the values of Open Science. In an Open Science ecosystem, each individual contribution builds on and contributes to the whole body of knowledge which is bigger than any one person. And making a real difference in addressing the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions is extremely important. &nbsp;I also love science and I&rsquo;m fascinated by the influences of culture and context on scientific research and I feel very lucky to be able to work at something that interests me and where I have lots of opportunities to learn.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p>I haven&rsquo;t given too much thought to what people will think, but I hope that my contributions will have made a difference. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with some amazing people &ndash; both scientists and publishing professionals &ndash; from whom I have learned a lot and with whom I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun too! I&nbsp; have former team members who have gone on to develop their careers in ways that they have found rewarding and where they&rsquo;ve also been able to influence and drive change and I have valued the opportunity to work with them. And I hope I will have contributed in some way to address injustice and imbalance in the system &ndash; and maybe even been part of making it possible for us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by a system based on Open Science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mealworms-sugar-new-seasoning-smell-meat">A new seasoning smells like meat thanks to sugar — and mealworms</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spoonful of sugar may help the mealworms go down.</p>



<p>Adding sugars to powdered, cooked mealworms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_d5BghR88&amp;list=PL-qHxGvFeZV11YAygI6lgZ6yOq2nWwvv7&amp;index=5">creates a seasoning</a> with an appetizing “meatlike” odor, researchers report August 24 at the American Chemical Society fall meeting in Chicago.</p>



<p>Some insects have been found to be an environmentally friendly alternative to other animal protein <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">because they require less land and water to raise</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/19</em>). But many people in the United States and other Western countries, where insects aren’t eaten widely, generally find the idea of chomping down on bugs unappetizing.</p>





<p>“There aren&#8217;t a lot of people ready to fry up a whole skillet of crickets and eat them fresh,” says Julie Lesnik, a biological anthropologist at Wayne State University in Detroit who wasn’t involved in the new research. Finding out how to make insect-based foods more appealing could be key to making them more mainstream.</p>



<p>And one successful insect-based product could have a snowball effect for similar food. “It&#8217;s really great that this research is happening, because at any point this might be the thing that people figure out and then it explodes,” says Brenden Campbell, an insect agriculturist based in Eugene, Ore. He has studied mealworms and created a company called Planet Bugs to, in part, make insect-based food products.</p>



<p>In a previous study, chemist In Hee Cho of Wonkwang University in South Korea and colleagues analyzed the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372989/">odors given off by mealworms that were steamed, roasted or deep-fried</a>. Steamed mealworms produced a sweet smell, like corn, while roasted and fried mealworms released chemicals more similar to meat and seafood.</p>



<p>In their latest work, the team then keyed in on what combinations of water, sugars and cooking time produced a particularly meaty smell, and tested these concoctions with volunteers to figure out which smelled the most appealing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insects ground up or in seasonings, like Cho’s team did, could help people get past their hesitations about eating whole bugs, says Amy Wright, who has written a book on eating bugs. (She, for one, has no qualms. A literature professor at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tenn., Wright used to keep mealworms in her apartment, which she would use in sandwiches and guacamole.)</p>



<p>“There are plenty of things that are disgusting to us, but we have engineered around it,” Lesnik says. “We&#8217;re just seeing insects being treated like any other food, and yeah, we&#8217;re talking aroma … but that&#8217;s what the engineers of Doritos are doing.”</p>

                Standardized time is broadcast by satellite networks around the world, but their signals are vulnerable to interference—so the UK is building a more resilient system.

                A Springer Nature journal has retracted a 2017 paper on induced brain injuries in piglets over questions about the data – making us wonder if the animals weren’t essentially tortured (if the experiments truly took place) as part of someone’s misconduct.&#160;&#160; Meanwhile, Springer Nature seems to have wiped its hands clean of the matter involving &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Penn maintains wall of silence over now-retired prof as retractions mount</span></a>
