                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/07/18/video-how-facebook-preys-on-our-mental-health/">VIDEO: How Facebook Preys on Our Mental Health</a></h4>

<p>In an ironic turn, the recent controversy surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica eclipsed another controversy brewing months before. As 2017 came to close, the million-dollar question surrounding the company was, <em>Does Facebook make us depressed?</em></p>
<p>Back in December, even Facebook itself posted an article on its official blog, titled, <em>Hard Questions: Is Spending Time on Social Media Bad For Us? </em>The post cites a number of studies that prove spending time on <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/">Facebook can threaten well-being</a>.</p>
<p>One study from the University of San Diego and Yale found that people who clicked on four times as many links or liked twice as many posts as the average person reported decreased mental health in a survey. A broader study found that increases in “likes clicked,” “links clicked,” or “status updates” was associated with decreases in mental health.</p>
<p>But though these studies might prove <em>that </em>Facebook brings us down, they don’t ask the important question of <em>how </em>Facebook brings us down. For a more thorough dive into what truly addict us to the site, ultimately leaving us feeling unsatisfied, check out this video, which explains the subject in depth:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The video presents arguments from two former employees, Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, who claim that Facebook was designed to prey on its users’ neurochemical reward systems. Dopamine, the chemical released in the brain during certain activities, such as exercising, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/31/daytime-nap-productivity-and-brain-functions/">finishing tasks</a> at work, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/12/food-and-mood-how-they-influence-each-other/">finding food</a>, has also been found to surge during social interactions. The brain desires cooperation and connection, so it sends reward signals in the form of dopamine when this cooperation or connection occurs. It could be something as simple as carrying a couch up a flight of stairs with a friend, or as profound as telling your partner you love her.</p>
<p>Because the brain cannot distinguish between, an interaction in real life and one on Facebook in terms of dopamine release, these rewards systems are integral to Facebook’s interface. Even the little red notification, or the ping sound we’ve all become accustomed to, produce a similar dopamine release.</p>
<p>The key insight in the video is that Facebook knows these dopamine hits are essential to their business model, the main driving force bringing people back to the site over and over and over again. Knowing this, they’ve ramped up notifications over the years, spiking our dopamine levels for something as mundane and uninteresting as someone having gone “live” a few hours ago, or a belated birthday, or even just to tell you that you haven’t posted in a while.</p>
<p>What happens, then, is a uniquely modern phenomenon. Your brain is rewarding you with dopamine for a successful social interaction, but in reality, no genuine connection has occurred, creating a disconnect between the chemical reward system in your brain and your actual lived experience.</p>
<p>Obviously, Facebook can depress its users in a number of ways. People often assume others’ lives are happier than theirs because of how their friends present themselves online. Teen brains are now trained to be distracted based on the interface alone. But this feeling, the dopamine hit followed by immediate disappointment with the reality of a meaningless notification, seems central to the deflating feeling Facebook can produce.</p>

<p>"The Office of Scholarly Communication provides information, advice and training on research data management.  So when faced with running a research project that involves a considerable amount of data, it is telling to see if we can practice what we preach. This blog post is a short list of how we have approached managing data for analysis. Judging by our colleagues’ faces when we described some of the advice here, this is blindingly obvious to some people. But it was news to us, so we are sharing it in case it is helpful to others.</p>

<p>As is good practice we have started with  a  Data Management Plan. Actually we ended up having to write two, one for the qualitative and one for the quantitative aspect of the project. ..."</p>

<p>"Jennifer Chan has been selected to receive LITA’s first scholarship to attend the 2018 ALA Leadership Institute. Chan is the Scholarly Communication Librarian at the UCLA Library. Her work focuses on altmetrics and bibliometrics, open access, the Affordable Course Materials Initiative, and research impact. She liaises with campus partners on the development of targeted outreach and programming that promote scholarly communication and develops open education strategies to further the campus mission of research, teaching, and public service. When notified she had been selected, Chan said, “My experience working in a ‘Katrina Trailer’ in a public library system that lost several libraries to Hurricane Katrina underscored for me the importance of access and library reliance upon technological infrastructure. I have been a proud member of the Library and Information Technology Association since the start of my career in academic libraries. Recognizing the continually evolving role of information technology within our profession, I've found great value in my membership, and in the relationships with colleagues formed through LITA. I am so honored and grateful to receive this participation scholarship from LITA to attend the 2018 ALA Leadership Institute, and look forward to taking the skills I acquire to further contribute to our profession and to my goal of better connecting us all.” The ALA Leadership Institute is designed to help future library leaders develop and practice their leadership skills in areas critical to the future of the libraries they lead. Through reflective and active learning, it offers participants an opportunity to delve into leadership practices, concepts, and frameworks, and to shape their own sustainable leadership vision and ethos, at the same time as building a learning community and network. The first scholarship of its type, this opportunity was funded by LITA members who responded generously to our 2017 fundraising campaign."</p>

<p>"According to this article at the Guardian, the European Union is to be applauded for its goal of open access to all scientific publications by 2020. However, writer and Open Science advocate Jon Tennant condemns one key decision in, “Elsevier Are Corrupting Open Science in Europe.” He tells us:</p>

<p>“However, a cursory glance at the methodological note reveals something rather odd. The subcontractor for the monitor is Elsevier, the publisher and data analytics provider. Within scholarly communications, Elsevier has perhaps the single worst reputation. With profit margins around 37%, larger than Apple and big oil companies, Elsevier dominate the publishing landscape by selling research back to the same institutes that carried out the work. It gets worse too. Throughout the methods, you can see that there is an overwhelming bias towards Elsevier products and services, such as Scopus, Mendeley, and Plum Analytics. These services provide metrics for researchers such as citation counts and social media shares, as well as data-sharing and networking platforms. There are now dozens of comments in the note pointing out the clear bias towards Elsevier and the overlooking of alternatives. It is worth highlighting some of the key issues here that the Commission seems to have ignored in subcontracting to Elsevier.”</p>

<p>One such issue is Elsevier’s alleged track record of working against openness in order to protect its own financial interests. Also, many throughout the EU, including prominent research institutes, have turned against the publisher in distrust. Last but not least, naming an entity that stands to benefit as the Open Science Monitor is an obvious conflict of interest, Tennant declares with understandable incredulity. See the article for details on each of these points. The author is clearly aghast the appointment was allowed in the first place, and recommends the European Commission remove Elsevier from the position posthaste. Worth watching via open source information, of course."</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.ubyssey.ca/science/open-science-network/">Former UBC collective aims to make science accessible to the public</a></h4>

<p>"Although science is a large faculty within UBC and many institutions, accessing science outside of the institutions and classrooms is more challenging for the general public. How can a citizen participate in science without equipment, lab time, expertise, or even collaborators? In 2009, a group of UBC students and staff recognized these barriers and teamed up to democratize science, increase its accessibility and create an interdisciplinary platform for idea exchange. They created the Open Science Network (OSN). The Open Science Network is a non-profit society that serves the science and maker community through education, outreach and the provision of space. Currently, they run an open community lab out of the MakerLabs space on East Cordova and Main street, which is a compact space housing microscopes, a freezer, basic lab equipment and an impressive amount of activity...."</p>

<p>"The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have published a framework to help academics, research institutions and funders bring open science to the fore. In the "Open Science by Design" report, published Tuesday, the academies make several recommendations to help make open science an integral part of the research process. These recommendations include creating better rewards for academics who practice open science, incorporating open science training into student curricula and making it easier for researchers to identify which research materials should be preserved and shared. Though good progress has been made in terms of the number of academics publishing in open-access journals, the academies said that publication of other research materials, such as data and code, is not yet routine. This is due in part to researchers’ concerns that they might “get scooped” if they share their data sets before they have finished working with them, the academies said."</p>

<p>"A hearing on a proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule took on an increasingly urgent and emotional tone on Tuesday, as speakers decried an effort that experts say would have a dramatic impact on the agency’s ability to protect human health and the environment. The morning half of a lengthy hearing set to run from 8 a.m. to as late as 8 p.m. in Washington, D.C. saw speakers from a diverse array of organizations. Larger groups, like the Environmental Defense Fund and the American Lung Association, were joined by a number of smaller groups, as well as a few individual advocates testifying on behalf of themselves...."</p>

<p>Our approach is simple: contributors will be added to the @openglam account through Tweetdeck and will get a chance to curate the conversation coming from that Twitter account for 2 weeks. You can read the instructions for participants here. If you want to contribute, please sign up on this Google form! Our first curator is going to be @samuelguebo, a Wikimedia community member who has been leading partnerships with libraries in Côte d’Ivoire and will be attending Wikimania 2018 in Cape Town, South Africa this week. Do you have an upcoming event or activity that you think will spark a conversation? Contact us to become the next curator! Curating the @openglam account is part of a broader conversation that organizations like OKI, WMF and CC are having about growing the impact of the “big open”. We hope that this curated Twitter will open up conversations about what brings us together as practitioners and enthusiasts for Open GLAM. There has been massive change in the cultural heritage sector and open communities in the past few years — the Open GLAM community is brought together by a set of principles that may need to evolve to meet these changing contexts...."</p>

<p>"As we settle into the summer season here in Hawaii, it’s time to look back at the first six months of the year and reflect on the policy happenings. As I’ll take a few words to explain, Hawaii State Senate Bill SB 2328 appeared on our radar in January, the first high-level policy in Hawaii to focus on the development and adoption of Open Educational Resources. To be sure, the original mandates of the well-intended bill were impossible to effect as they infringed on the academic freedom of faculty. But even as feedback through testimony and hearings improved the bill — by establishing a task force and grant program — and seemed likely to pass, last minute testimony and revised wording marred the bill with inaccurate statements regarding copyright and OER, and the publishing industry came onto the scene. Opinions aside about whether or not a bill for OER is actually needed for it to flourish in Hawaii, the process of following a bill from first introduction to its quiet death offered an interesting look into the legislative process for policy affecting the University of Hawaii (UH)...."</p>

When to apply? From now on please apply at the point of acceptance (instead of at article submission), which is the same timing as Wellcome Trust/COAF block grant and ‘Act on Acceptance’. The APC team will advise if funds are available in our block grant and if the journal is eligible.

<p>"4 years ago in 2014, I wrote about the coming disruption to academic libraries due to Open Access. In How academic libraries may change when Open Access becomes the norm , I wrote "The trend I am increasingly convinced that is going to have a great impact on how academic libraries will function is the rise of Open Access.  As Open Access takes hold and eventually becomes the norm in the next 10-15 years, it will disrupt many aspects of academic library operations and libraries will need to rethink the value-add they need to provide to universities. The events of the past year have convinced me that the momentum for open access is nearly unstoppable and the tipping point for open access has or will occur soon. " How do we know the tipping point has been reached? Simple, discovery tools which had for years ignored or gave cursory attention to discovery of free to read articles started to get serious about open access discovery, as the pool of open access articles has become too large to ignore and being able to reliably detect and point to them is a critical issue. From 2017 onwards, whether it is moves from existing players in the discovery space like Summon/Primo (Proquest/Exlibris), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clairvate) or from new disrupters like Kopernio, Unpaywall, Lean Library browser, Anywhere Access (Digital Science), 1Findr(1Science), Open Access button etc we saw this happen.  This is a fast moving space, but here's a fairly recent summary by me at CNI Spring 2018 on some of the issues. So what's next? While the first phrase of open access benefited human researchers who could get access and read articles, the next phase I think might belong to the machines...."</p>

<p>"Oops. A few months ago, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a new policy that it claimed would “strengthen transparency” in the science it uses to craft regulation. To support its case, the agency alluded to a few major research institutions—namely, three of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals and two bipartisan reports on science and policy.</p>

<p>“The proposal is consistent,” bragged an EPA statement, “with data access requirements for major scientific journals like Science, Nature, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as well as recommendations from the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Science for Policy Project and the Administrative Conference of the United States’ Science in the Administrative Process Project.” It was not, actually. Within a week, the editors in chief of those three “major scientific journals” clarified that the proposed rule had nothing to do with their policies. And a lead author of the two bipartisan reports rejected the rule as well, saying that her colleagues “would laugh and hoot” at its ideas...."</p>

No stranger to financial uncertainty over its 20-year history, the clearinghouse is an initiative of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which earmarked $1.2 million to fund the site in 2017. While some bemoan its demise, the website may soon be rescued, according to the agency, which noted in its announcement that it has received some interest from unnamed stakeholders wanting to carry on the work.

<p>We tend to think of sensory receptors (photoreceptors, inner hair cells) or sensory neurons (retinal ganglion cells; auditory nerve fibers) as measuring physical dimensions, for example light intensity or acoustical pressure, or some function of it. The analogy is with physical instruments of measure, like a thermometer or a microphone. This confers a representational quality to the activity of neurons, an assumption that is at the core of the neural coding metaphor. I explain at length why that metaphor is misleading in many ways in an essay (Brette (2018) <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?</a>). Here I want to examine more specifically the notion of biological measurement and the challenges it poses.</p>
<p>This notion comes about not only in classical representationalist views, where neural activity is seen as symbols that the brain then manipulates (the perception-cognition-action model, also called sandwich model), but also in alternative views, although it is less obvious. For example, one alternative is to see the brain not as a computer system (encoding symbols, then manipulating them) but as a control system (see Paul Cisek’s <a href="http://www.cisek.org/pavel/Pubs/Cis1999.pdf">behavior as interaction</a>, William Powers’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory">perceptual control theory</a>, Tim van Gelder’s <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/the-dynamical-hypothesis-in-cognitive-science/C121F1B65A534F3E7A27075EE489AD1E">dynamical view of cognition</a>). In this view, the activity of neurons does not encode stimuli. In fact there is no stimulus per se, as Dewey pointed out: “the motor response determines the stimulus, just as truly as sensory stimulus determines the movement.”.</p>
<p>A simple case is feedback control: the system tries to maintain some input at a target value. To do this, the system must compare the input with an internal value. We could imagine for example something like an idealized version of the stretch reflex: when the muscle is stretched, a sensory feedback triggers a contraction, and we want to maintain muscle length constant. But this apparently trivial task raises a number of deep questions, as more generally the application of control theory to biological systems. I suppose there is a sensor, a neuron that transduces some physical dimension into spike trains, for example the stretch of a muscle. There is also an actuator, which reacts to a spike by a physical action, for example contracting the muscle with a particular time course. I chose a spike-based description not just because it corresponds to the physiology of the stretch reflex, but also because it will illustrate some fundamental issues (which would exist also with graded transduction, but less obviously so).</p>
<p>Now we have a neuron, or a set of neurons, which receive these sensory inputs and send spikes to the actuator. For this discussion, it is not critical that these are actually neurons; we can just consider that there is a system there, and we ask how this system should be designed so as to successfully achieve a control task.</p>
<p>The major issue here is that the control system does not directly deal with the physical dimension. At first sight, we could think this is a minor issue. The physical dimension gets transduced, and we could simply define the target value in the transduced dimension (eg the current). But here we see that the problem is more serious. What the control system deals with is not simply a function of the physical dimension. More accurately, transduction is a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by a physical signal. The physical signal can be constant, for example, while the transduced current decays (adaptation) and the sensory neuron outputs spike trains, i.e., a highly variable signal. This poses a much more serious problem than a simple calibration problem. When the controlled physical value is at the target value, the sensory neuron might be spiking, perhaps not even at a regular rate. The control system should react to that particular kind of signal by not acting, while it should act when the signal deviates from it. But how can the control system identify the target state, or even know whether to act in one or the opposite direction?</p>
<p>Adaptation in neurons is often depicted as an optimization of information transmitted, in line with the metaphor of the day (coding). But the relevant question is: how does the receiver of this “information” knows how the neuron has adapted? Does it have to de-adapt, to somehow be matched to the adaptive process of the encoding neuron? (This problem has to do with the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">dualistic structure of the neural coding metaphor</a>).</p>
<p>There are additional layers of difficulty. We have first recognized that transduction is not a simple mapping from a physical dimension to a biological (e.g. electrochemical) dimension, but rather a dynamical system influenced by a physical signal. Now this dynamical system depends on the structure of the sensory neuron. It depends for example on the number of ionic channels and their properties, and we know these are highly plastic and indeed quite variable both across time and across cells. This dynamical system also depends on elements of the body, or let’s say more generally the neuron’s environment. For example, the way acoustical pressure is transduced in current by an inner hair cell depends obviously on the acoustical pressure at the eardrum, but that physical signal depends on the shape the ear, which filters sounds. Properties of neurons change with time too, development and aging. Thus, we cannot assume that the dynamical transformation from physical signal to biological signal is a fixed one. Somehow, the control system has to work despite this huge plasticity and the dynamical nature of the sensors.</p>
<p>Let us pause for a moment and outline a number of differences between physical measurements, as with a thermometer, and biological measurements (or “sensing”):</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical meter is calibrated with respect to an external reference, for example 0°C is when water freezes, while 100°C is when it boils. The biological sensor cannot be calibrated with respect to an external reference.</li>
<li>The physical meter produces a fixed value for a stationary signal. The biological sensor produces a dynamical signal in response to a stationary signal. More accurately, the biological sensor is a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by the physical signal.</li>
<li>The physical meter is meant to be stable, in that the mapping from physical quantity to measurement is fixed. When it is not, this is considered an error. The biological sensor does not have fixed properties. Changes in properties occur in the normal course of life, from birth to death, and some changes in properties are interpreted as adaptations, not errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these differences, we realize that biological sensors do not provide physical measurements in the usual sense. The next question, then, is how can a biological system control a physical dimension with biological sensors that do not act as measurements of that dimension?</p>

<p>We’ve all been there: feeling so grateful to a friend or colleague that we hatch the idea of sending them a thank-you message. But then we worry about how to phrase it. And then we figure it probably won’t mean much to them anyway; if anything it could all be a bit awkward. So we don’t bother.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? According to a pair of US psychologists, a common failure of perspective means that a lot of us underestimate the positive impact on others (and ourselves) of expressing gratitude, meaning that we miss out on a simple way to improve our social relations and wellbeing. Based on <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618772506">their series of experiments in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, <a href="http://www.kumar-amit.com">Amit Kumar</a> at the University of Texas at Austin and <a href="http://www.kumar-amit.com">Nicholas Epley</a> at Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago conclude that “expressing gratitude might not buy everything, but it may buy more than people seem to expect”.</p>
<p><span id="more-34283"></span></p>
<p>The research involved hundreds of participants, some recruited to take part at the psych lab and others online via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. The format through some of the experiments was broadly similar. Participants were asked to write a letter of thanks via email to someone who had touched their life in a meaningful way, including expressing what the person had done and how it had affected their life.</p>
<p>Across these experiments, the participants were asked to make various predictions about how the recipient would feel and perceive them. Meanwhile, the researchers made contact with the recipients to find out how they actually felt and what they actually thought.</p>
<p>The senders of the thank-you letters consistently underestimated how positive the recipients felt about receiving the letters and how surprised they were by the content. The senders also overestimated how awkward the recipients felt; and they underestimated how warm, and especially how competent, the recipients perceived them to be. Age and gender made no difference to the pattern of findings.</p>
<p>Other experiments showed that these same misjudgments affect our willingness to write thank-you messages. For instance, participants who felt less competent about writing a message of gratitude were less willing to send one; and, logically enough, participants were least willing to send thank-you messages to recipients who they felt would benefit the least.</p>
<p>Kumar and Epley believe that this asymmetry between the perspective of the potential expresser of gratitude and the recipient means that we often refrain from a “powerful act of civility” that would benefit both parties.</p>
<p>A similar dynamic could also play out in other situations. “If people engaging in prosocial actions are more concerned about competence than those benefiting from them, then our experimental results should be just one example of a broader tendency,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>A methodological limitation is that the researchers were unable to reach all letter recipients and it’s possible those less impressed by the thank-you note were less willing to take part in the research. However, the available data don’t back this up – for instance, the mis-predictions of the expressers of gratitude were just as great in the experiments in which more recipients took part (therefore reducing the risk that only happy recipients had participated).</p>
<p>These are intriguing findings that complement other work by Epley and colleagues showing how our fear of awkwardness can lead us to misjudge what is in our own best interests, such as underestimating <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/">how much we will enjoy interacting with strangers</a>.</p>

<h4>Why your brain makes bad decisions sometimes</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ihSuVpUB703Yo245QA2_g.jpeg" />Try and try till you succeed may not always be the best advice. (Photo credit: Raeesa Gupte)</figure><blockquote>“I hated the movie but decided to suffer through it because I had paid for the ticket…in 3D!”</blockquote><blockquote>“The store was overpriced but I bought the dress because I drove all the way out there.”</blockquote><blockquote>“His business isn’t doing well but he’s sticking with it because he’s invested so much time and money in it already!”</blockquote><p>Sound familiar? How many times have you persisted at a task that you know deep down is an exercise in futility?</p><p>In theory, decisions should be made based on the magnitude of future benefits for the decision-maker. However, in the real world we often make decisions based on the magnitude of past resources that have already been expended and cannot be recovered (time and money). This “sunk costs” phenomenon makes us persist with our original choices even in the face of better alternatives. If it makes you feel any better, we aren’t the only species susceptible to the sunk costs fallacy. Scientists have discovered that bad decision-making is an evolutionary glitch and exists even in animals other than humans.</p><p><strong>How to test if animals make bad decisions based on sunk costs?</strong></p><p>Scientists at the University of Minnesota used a clever <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/178">experimental setup to test susceptibility to sunk costs</a> across three species: mice, rats, and humans. For rats and mice, they exploited their natural tendency to forage for food. So they designed a “restaurant” for rodents where the menu consisted of four flavors of food pellets: plain, grape, chocolate, and banana (yum!).</p><p>Each flavor was served at a different table that had a decision-making area (offer zone) and a wait-for-the-food area (wait zone). While in the decision-making area, a tone was played that indicated how long the animal would have to wait before it got the food. The wait time varied randomly between 1-30 seconds. Here, they had the choice to either enter the wait area or skip that table and move to the next one. In the wait area, sound tones counted down to indicate how much time was left before the animal would get the food pellet. Here, the animal could choose to wait for the food or to leave at any time and move to the next table. If they left the wait area before the time ran out, they could not return to that particular flavor without going through all the other flavor tables in the restaurant first. Here’s a schematic to explain the experimental setup:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/625/1*7eYZbfm1l8P-KiF4Zffw4g.png" />Credit: Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans. Sweis BM et al., Science, 2018.</figure><p><strong>How to quantify bad decision-making influenced by sunk costs in humans?</strong></p><p>For Netflix-loving, instant streaming-craving Homo Sapiens, scientists modified the foraging task slightly. Knowing how we can all forego food and sleep while binge-watching our favorite shows online, they modeled a web-surfing task for human participants. To ensure that results could reliably be compared across species, they retained the overall basic premise of the rodent experiments while modifying it to sufficiently motivate our superior human brains.</p><p>Subjects could view short videos in one of four galleries under the following categories: dance, accidents, landscapes, or kittens. They were shown how long they would have to wait for the video to download which varied randomly between 1–30 seconds. For each video they could opt to watch the video or skip and move on to the next viewing gallery (similar to the offer zone in the rodent test). Once they clicked on the “stay” option and decided to watch the video, the screen would show a download progression bar indicating how long they would have to wait to view the video (similar to the wait zone in the rodent test). The download could be quit during this wait phase to move on to the next viewing gallery.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/619/1*SLRpJdZ2t63goBxElznGvg.png" />Credit: Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans. Sweis BM et al., Science, 2018.</figure><p><strong>So, what’s the verdict?</strong></p><p>The researchers found that mice, rats, and humans all fell prey to the sunk cost effect. The more time that rodents spent in the wait area awaiting the food pellet, the more likely they were to persist till the end. Similarly, the longer that humans waited for the video to download, the more likely they were to stay till it finished downloading to watch it.</p><p>Weirdly, it turned out that the time rodents and humans took to decide on the offer had no impact on how much they then persisted in waiting for it. Only when they had committed to a particular flavor food pellet or video did their probability of persisting till the very end increase. These experiments show that we keep track of effort invested in waiting, not deciding.</p><p>Also, the longer they waited for their chosen reward, the more likely they were to persist till the end. In short, the more resources (time/money/energy) you commit to a particular task, the stronger your resolve to stay the course even if it is to your own detriment! On the other hand, the amount of time spent waiting correlated positively with how much the reward was valued. For example, after consuming the food pellet rodents lingered longer at the table where they spent a longer time waiting and humans rated videos that took longer to download as more enjoyable. Now you know why you cherish an outcome you worked really hard for more than an easy victory.</p><p><strong>Why would evolution want you to persist in the face of failure?</strong></p><p>Scientists postulate that two distinct decision-making algorithms may be at play in the brain when making choices based on sunk costs. Before committing to a task, the brain has to estimate its value to an organism by predicting future outcomes. This is a complex and difficult process. Therefore, brains of different species may have evolved in a similar manner to use past effort as a measure of predicting future value. Unfortunately, in many real-life scenarios there may only be a very limited correlation between past resources spent and future value to be gained. In such cases the parts of our brain that evolved to minimize wastage of resources kicks in and urges us not to stop till we have achieved our goal. So let’s hope our brains continue to learn and evolve to make better life-choices!</p><p><strong>Turning lemons into lemonade</strong></p><p>Perhaps evolution has dealt us a raw deal. But there’s a silver lining yet. Understanding the neurological basis of decision-making can have far-reaching implications for developing better educational programs, economic policies, and interventions for psychiatric disorders. For instance, understanding the neurobiology of sunk costs can aid in the treatment of addiction by developing drugs that alter the underlying malfunctioning neuronal circuitry or by use of cognitive behavioral therapy. This is not an unattainable goal given that the one thing we excel at as scientists is persistence!</p><p><em>You can follow this crossword-solving, travel-seeking, camera-touting scientist constantly torn between coffee and chai on Twitter </em><a href="https://twitter.com/@NeuroRaeesa"><em>@NeuroRaeesa</em></a></p><p><em>Want more?

<p>In theory, our personal traits and interests should affect the jobs we pursue and where we thrive the most. This assumption is baked into the Work Psychology theory of “person-environment fit” and it’s an idea that is foundational to services we depend on like vocational guidance and career planning. But one of its key implications has until now been untested: that people who share the same job role will also have similar job interests. Now a surprising new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879118300447">study</a> in the <i>Journal of Vocational Behavior</i> suggests that for many jobs, this simply isn’t true.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34275"></span></p>
<p>The Michigan State University research team led by Christopher Nye used the Strong Interest Inventory (that measures interest in six areas: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional) to determine whether people in the same occupation were similar in terms of which was their top-ranked interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Among their sample of 67,000 people, across 211 jobs, those in the same occupational role did sometimes show a strong tendency to share the same primary interest – the strongest example being for fine artists, auto mechanics and carpenters, where in each case, 82 per cent of role holders shared the same focus – Artistic for the first and Realistic for the latter two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But people in other occupations showed much less similarity in interests. For instance, in almost half of the occupations, only the thinnest of majorities tended to share the same interest, meaning that a lot of the time two people in the exact same job often had very different occupational interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Could the results be skewed by the sample being stacked with people trapped in jobs that they hate? This isn’t plausible, as the study only involved people who were reasonably satisfied in their role and had worked there at least three years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s possible the variability was exaggerated by only focusing on the top interest. So in a second study using different occupational samples (58 datasets in total), the research team tried a more sophisticated statistical angle that looked for the degree of alignment between a person’s top three interests and the three interests conventionally considered to characterise the job. Nye’s team found that just over half the jobs showed more alignment than you would expect to see at random, but the remaining 45 per cent were the same or less. What this means is that a sizeable minority of occupations are filled by people who aren’t especially interested in the type of work their role is understood to require.</p>
<p>Defenders of person-environment fit could rustle up some retorts. You might find people with a poor fit in jobs with low barriers to entry, which are easy to fall into without any forethought. Perhaps if analysis were restricted to challenging vocations with higher barriers to entry, or people staying in jobs for a long time, there would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>far more congruence between interests and job roles? In fact, the first study showed no effect of occupational tenure – people longer in jobs did not have a better fit than newer incumbents. And the second study showed that employees in several jobs that require extensive preparation or specialist education also had diverse interests, such as secondary school teacher and even clergy.</p>
<p>This suggests we should reconsider the assumption that people are primarily drawn to jobs because of the types of things they want to do. In some cases this is sure to be true, but exceptions abound. Some people chase a job not for what it involves but for the money, or security, or the company they get to keep. And people may find ways to shape jobs around their own interests – called job crafting – or be able to draw from it rewards that may not be obvious to everyone, such as the London Tube station assistant who <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/paperback-tunnel-visions-by-christopher-ross-9183130.html">wrote a book</a> on how the experience delivered to his philosophical, Investigative interests.</p>
<p>This work may give some careers advisors pause for thought – occupational interests are often used as the easy shorthand to determine recommendations, but a multi-level approach considering personality and broader life goals is preferable. And for ourselves, we should allow our curiosity to be roused. When you’re next at work, why not ask your colleagues what led them to the work they are doing, and what they get from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The answer is likely to surprise you.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/07/16/mental-health-is-not-just-the-absence-of-mental-illness/">Mental Health is Not Just the Absence of Mental Illness</a></h4>

<p>In an increasingly globalized and mediatized world, in which mental illness is one of society’s most discussed cultural artifacts, Colleen Patrick Goudreau’s words ring out: “If we don’t have time to be sick, then we have to make time to be healthy”.</p>
<p>With the prevalence of mental health problems, it is clear why. Mental health issues are one of the leading causes of the overall disease burden globally, according to the World Health Organisation. One study reported that mental health is the primary source of disability worldwide, causing over 40 million years of disability in 20 to 29-year-olds.</p>
<p>Compared to previous generations, mental illness is now said to surpass the effects of the Black Death. The root causes of the unprecedented rise in people directly affected by mental illness, and the cost of this, can be considered across at least three levels of analysis.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we don’t have time to be sick, then we have to make time to be healthy.</p>
<p>Colleen Patrick Goudreau</p></blockquote>
<p>At the first level of analysis, the root cause of mental illness is an amalgamation of heredity, biology, environmental stressors, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2010/01/18/coping-with-trauma-lessons-from-resilient-individuals/">psychological trauma</a>.</p>
<p>Notions of specific genes being responsible for illness have been supplanted by those of genetic complexity, where various genes operate in concert with non-genetic factors to affect mental illness. That is, health-relevant biology and mental health impact each other in a complex interplay, which is inherently social.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of understanding the social underpinnings of biological risk factors for mental illness, there is a relative paucity of research investigating this topic. Research that does exist, is nevertheless engrossing. For example, one study, of many, found that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/05/15/anti-stigmatization-social-isolation-and-mental-illness/">social isolation</a> leads to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Since low levels of social integration are related to higher levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation related to coronary heart disease, social integration is posited to be a biological link between social isolation and coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>Moreover, social support affects physical perception. In a landmark study, researchers demonstrated that people accompanied by a supportive friend or those who imagined a supportive friend, estimated a hill to be less steep when compared to people who were alone.</p>
<blockquote><p> Mental health, like physical health, is more than the sum of functioning or malfunctioning parts.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the second level of analysis, the complex bio-social interplay scaffolding mental illness points to the fundamentally chemical underpinnings of human thinking and emotion.</p>
<p>With recent advances in neuroscience like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-NMfp13Uug">Clarity</a>, we are now able to make the brain optically transparent, without having to section or reconstruct it, in order to examine the neuronal networks, subcellular structures, and more. In short, we can examine mental illness from a biological perspective.</p>
<p>The depth and complexity of the bio-social root of mental illness, however, paints a more nuanced picture than discussed thus far. With such pioneering work, there is an increasingly popular assumption that the brain is the most important level at which to analyze human behavior.</p>
<p>In this vein, mental illness perpetuates itself by virtue of the fact that people often consider it to be biologically determined. In turn, a ‘trait-like’ view of mental illness establishes a status quo of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/04/stigma-towards-mental-health-stigma-impacts-vocation/">mental health stigma</a> by reducing empathy. Such explanations overemphasize constant factors such as biology and underemphasize modulating factors such as the environment.</p>
<p>At the third level of analysis, the obsession with seeing mental health in terms of mental illness reveals the fallible assumption that mental health is simply the absence of mental disorder. However, the problematic landscape of mental health draws on a far wider set of working assumptions. That is, mental health, like physical health, is more than the sum of the functioning or malfunctioning parts. It is an overall well-being that must be considered in light of unique differences between physical health, cognition, and emotions, which can be lost in a solely global evaluation.</p>
<p>So, why do we as a society ponder solving mental illness, which should have been targeted long ago, far more than we consider improving mental health? In part, because when we think of mental health, we think of raising the mean positive mental health of a population, more than closing the implementation gap between prevention, promotion, and treatment.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, social environments are the lubricating oil to biological predispositions, which influence mental health, such that mental health and physical health should be considered holistically. In this vein, national mental health policies should not be solely concerned with mental disorders, to the detriment of mental health promotion.</p>
<p>It is worth considering how mental health issues can be targeted using proactive behavioral programs. To achieve this, it is pivotal to involve all relevant government sectors such as education, labor, justice, and welfare sectors. </p>
<p>In a diverse range of existing players, many nonprofits’, educational institutions’, and research groups’ efforts contribute to the solution landscape of mental health promotion. In Ireland, for example, schools have mental health promotional activities such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/20/re-learning-the-joy-of-living-with-journaling-and-meditation/">breathing exercises</a> and anger management programs. Nonprofits around the world are increasingly seeing the value of community development programmes and capacity building (strengthening the skills of communities in so they can overcome the causes of their isolation). In addition, businesses are incorporating stress management into their office culture.</p>
<blockquote><p>We think of raising the mean positive mental health of a population, more than closing the implementation gap between prevention, promotion and treatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pursuit to empower people to help themselves joins up these social ventures to teach us that promoting mental health is optimized when it is preventative, occurring before mental illness emerges, and when it is linked to practical skills within a community. Furthermore, these social ventures exemplify how different types of efforts (government, nonprofit, business etc.) cater to different populations, from children to corporates.</p>
<p>While these social ventures bring hope to the future and underscore the importance of sustainable change, there are still too few programs effectively targeting people, who want to maximize already existent positive mental health not just to resolve or cope with mental health issues. If we continue to take such pride in our successful problem finding and solving of mental illness that we ignore mental illness prevention and mental health promotion, we are at risk of increasing the problem we are trying to solve.</p>

<h4>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience show that protein Kinase C is a novel information integrator, keeping tabs on the recent history of neighboring synapses while simultaneously monitoring local synaptic input</h4>
<p>Inside the brain, is a complex symphony of perfectly coordinated signaling. Hundreds of different molecules amplify, modify and carry information from tiny synaptic compartments all the way through the entire length of a neuron. The precise interplay of these proteins is critical for normal neuronal function; ultimately allowing the brain to achieve feats like cognition, decision making, and sensory perception.</p>
<p>Researchers from the lab of Ryohei Yasuda at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), study the elaborate nexus of signaling proteins involved in learning and memory; looking at a unique process called synaptic plasticity, the innate ability of a neural synapse to either strengthen or weaken. Understanding how proteins behave during plasticity is key to unlocking how we learn and how memories are formed.</p>
<p>In a study published in Nature Neuroscience in July 2018, Dr. Lesley Colgan, a Research Fellow in the Yasuda Lab and leading author of the paper, delves into the role that Protein Kinase C (PKC) plays in synaptic plasticity. PKC represents an entire family of 12 distinct kinases, that propagate a biochemical signal through the phosphorylation of target proteins they interact with. While previously implicated in synaptic plasticity, engineering tools sensitive enough to study PKC in the brain has been a major challenge. Yasuda’s team developed a host of sensors that can track the activity of PKCs with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity, probing when and where activation occurs as well as how these enzymes turn on and off. With these powerful sensors, they have been able to look more closely at the role that PKC plays at the single synapse level.</p>
<p>One enzyme in the PKC family, PKCα, plays a direct role in facilitating synaptic plasticity. When PKCα activity is perturbed, plasticity is subsequently disrupted; demonstrating that the protein is a critical first step in the initial molecular cascade. PKCα also has very robust activation and is rather spine specific, confining its activity to only the stimulated spine and not spreading to the surrounding dendrites.</p>
<p>A unique discovery of the study, found that PKCα acts to integrate two temporally distinctive signaling pathways both known to be critical for synaptic plasticity. The first is BDNF mediated, a slower, diffuse signal developing over minutes and the second, is NMDA receptor mediated calcium influx, a spine-specific signal occurring in a matter of milliseconds and necessary to begin the rapid molecular cascade of synaptic plasticity. Adaptably responding to both of these signals, PKCα is able to sample recent synaptic history and integrate it with current synaptic events, enabling complex processing of information at the single spine level.</p>
<p>Investigating these intriguing findings further, the team was able to successfully link molecules to memory, uncovering that PKC<span>α</span> is required for efficiency of learning. Mice with PKC<span>α</span> removed from the brain, take a significantly longer amount of time to become proficient at a learning task than counterparts containing intact PKC<span>α</span> protein. Despite this lengthier learning curve, if given additional training, mice lacking PKC<span>α</span> will eventually learn the task just as well as wild type mice; supporting the notion that PKC<span>α</span> is critical for encoding a memory but may not play a significant role in the recall of a memory once it’s established.</p>
<p>This work represents a substantial advancement in the field, providing integral tools that will enable the disentanglement of complex signaling related to learning and memory. According to Dr. Colgan, “These newly developed sensors will have broad usage in neuroscience and cell biology alike, allowing the study of many complex signaling pathways that PKC has a hand in.”</p>

A subthreshold stimulus that was unable to induce plasticity was given alone (unpaired) or after a nearby plasticity-inducing stimulation (paired). Unpaired, the stimulus could not activate PKCa or induce plasticity. However, when paired with recent plasticity in a nearby spine, which induces a long-lasting, spreading TrkB activity, this same subthreshold stimulus led to PKCa activation and plasticity.</em></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/AdobeStock_149171725-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Depression is a common psychological disorder that affects 121 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability when measured by years lived with disability (YLDs). Rising rates of depression diagnoses among youth, with about 20% experiencing depression before adulthood, have led many counties to prioritize initiatives that enhance prevention, early identification, and treatment efforts.</p>
<p>Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities of daily living, impacting overall health and wellbeing. The common misinterpretation of depressed states as transient “normal” phases of adolescence combined with widespread stigma have contributed to the current situation where the vast majority of depressed youth are not being treated.</p>
<p>The development of depression among youth can lead to substance (mis)use, decreased quality of life and suicide. Furthermore, young people who experience depression are also at increased risk of having poor health and economic outcomes in adulthood.</p>
<p>Factors that increase the risk of depression in young people include abuse and neglect, chronic physical illness, family history of mental illness, other mental health problems and the experience of stressful life events. It has also been found that female youth develop depression twice as often as young men, although some of this difference is due to the way researchers ask questions when determining symptoms of depression.</p>
<h3><strong>But what about sleep?</strong></h3>
<p>Sleep is essential for health and proper sleep for young people is critical for proper growth and it it is recommended that young people aged 13-18 years <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times">sleep 8 to 10 hours</a> per night. Yet, getting enough sleep is not commonly talked about as a potential determinant of youth depression.</p>
<blockquote><p>None of the existing studies look at gender differences despite the fact that women and men are known to differ in the developmental course of depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adolescence is a critical period of development that is marked by substantial reductions to slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep, increases in sleep disturbance, a circadian shift to an evening chronotype and a shortening of total duration of sleep. These neuro-endocrine changes often lead to young people lacking adequate amounts of total sleep. negative consequences of sleep deprivation include mood disturbances, poor academic performance, weight gain, increased food intake, substance use and other poor health behaviors.</p>
<p>The relationship between short sleep (i.e. poor quantity) and depression in young people has not been well studied. Although some investigators have used prospective study designs that allow for some inference about causality, the majority of work in this area involves cross-sectional designs which measure both sleep deprivation and depression at the same point in time so there is no way to know if disrupted sleep precedes the emergence of depression.</p>
<p>Even the studies that are somewhat better designed to assess causality frequently measure sleep problems only once and then follow people over time to identify risk of developing depression. Although not conclusive, the results of these types of studies suggest that short sleep duration precedes depression in young people but not the reverse.</p>
<p>None of the existing studies look at gender differences despite the fact that women and men are known to differ in the developmental course of depression, and they also experience distinct risk factors that are known to influence depression because of their biology and social status.</p>
<h3><strong>Our study</strong></h3>
<p>We wanted to fill this gap in evidence using data that was collected multiple times from a large <a href="http://www.basus.ca/">group of young people in British Columbia (BC), Canada</a>. We used answers that young people gave to questions about their sleep and awake times to determine whether they were sleep deprived and we calculated this at three time points, roughly 6 months apart.</p>
<p>This design allowed us to determine the extent to which they were chronically sleep deprived. We used this information to study the cumulative effect of chronic sleep deprivation (compared to occasional or no history of sleep deprivation) on the risk of depression from a gender perspective.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our work adds new evidence on the role of repeated sleep deprivation in young people on their risk of depression and how the effect differs by gender.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our hypothesis was that chronic sleep deprivation, defined as less than 8 hours per weeknight, would be linked to higher depression levels, and that the relationship would vary between young women and young men.</p>
<p>Our results showed that cumulative sleep deprivation in young women was linked to higher depression scores at the study follow-up, but there was no clear relationship among young men. The size of the effect we found was initially medium when we used simple statistical models of the relationship; however, it was smaller when we also accounted for a number of the factors that are known to influence both depression and sleep.</p>
<p>Our work adds new evidence on the role of repeated sleep deprivation in young people on their risk of depression and how the effect differs by gender. We believe this is an important area of research that needs more attention, both in terms of thinking about these relationships and in terms of measuring them in a rigorous way.</p>
<p>We think it is important for young women to be supported in achieving the recommended amount of sleep as a potentially important way of promoting mental health among young people.</p>

<p>Audiobook sales are booming, <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/audio-sales-double-five-years-764431">almost doubling in the UK</a> over the past five years. Some are now sophisticated, being voiced by multiple actors and featuring extensive sound effects. But even single-narrator audiobooks are, it’s been argued, more cognitively and emotionally engaging than print – in part because a listener can’t slow down, as they can with a print book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a writer whose latest psychology-themed novel <a href="https://emmayoung.net/she-myself-and-i"><em>She, Myself and I</em></a> is now being produced as an audiobook, I can’t help wondering about the benefits, and the costs. Personally, I like to be able to control my pace through a print book, to re-read sentences or paragraphs that I particularly enjoy or that I don’t quite process properly on a first read.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, as Daniel Richardson at UCL, and fellow researchers, point out in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/20/351148">new study</a>, available as a pre-print on the <em>bioRxiv</em> service, “Our oldest narratives date back many thousands of years and pre-date the advent of writing… For the majority of human history, stories were synonymous with oral tradition; audiences listened to a story-teller imparting a tale.” Humans did not evolve to read, so perhaps there’s something primordially special about listening to a story. But, as the researchers go on to write, “in the modern era, video has emerged as a major narrative tool as well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So which is more engaging – video or audio? That’s the focus of the new paper. And I’m intrigued. I’ve also sold TV rights to the novel, and TV, of course, is the medium of mass-appeal. If my book is ultimately turned into a TV series, might viewers become more involved in the story than my audiobook listeners?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34246"></span></p>
<p>Video offers more information than audio, the researchers point out (while two people both hearing “<i>The house was ablaze</i>” would imagine slightly different things, watching a film showing a house on fire leaves nothing to the imagination.) Oral stories might therefore elicit more engagement, as the listener has to construct a personalised interpretation of the narrative. But because audio is also more demanding than video, is there a bigger risk that listeners will lose interest in the story, and switch off?</p>
<p>To investigate, the researchers asked 102 men and women, aged 18-55, to wear a wrist sensor that captured their heart rate, sweating and wrist temperature while they listened to and watched a series of emotionally-charged scenes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These were a mix of audio and film-version extracts from eight works of fiction, including <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> by Dan Brown, and <i>Game of Thrones</i> by George R.R. Martin. The order of the presentations, and whether a particular story was presented as a video or as an audiobook extract, varied across participants.</p>
<p>At the end of each trial, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed four aspects of their perceived involvement in the story: their emotional engagement; their understanding of the narrative; their attentional focus; and the “narrative presence” (indicating to what extent they agreed or disagreed with “At times, the story was closer to me than the real world,” for example). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Though the participants reported <i>feeling</i> more<i> </i>engaged in the videos, their heart rates, body temperatures and skin conductance readings were all higher while they were listening to the audio. Increased heart rate was taken to indicate greater cognitive effort (there were no differences in levels of fidgeting between the audio and video trials), especially given the other data: the skin conductance and temperature readings suggested that the participants were more emotionally involved when listening to audio, the researchers argued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This paper has not been peer-reviewed yet. And, due to sensor failure, the researchers were not able to gather the full set of physiological recordings for all of the participants (they got electrodermal data for only 62, for instance). But if as this work suggests, people are at a physiological level more emotionally engaged by audio than watching film, this is good news for novelists. People might love watching TV dramas, but, in getting people more involved in a story, the form of the novel – whether in print or audio – reigns supreme.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Detailed analysis of an organism's <b>natural behavior</b> is indispensable for progress in understanding brain-behavior relationships.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Eciton_burchellii_army_ants-e1531393107574-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Scientists interested in the evolution of brains often use comparisons among species to explore how the nervous system is shaped by, and adapts to, its environment. Brain tissue is very expensive, and so investment in brains (or in particular brain regions) is expected to closely match the mental or psychological challenges a species confronts: there should be just enough brain power and brain tissue to get by, and no more.</p>
<p>We sought to extend this approach to ask whether members of the same species might differ predictably in brain structure and brain investment, in association with differences in behavioral demands.</p>
<h3><strong>Super-organisms</strong></h3>
<p>Animal societies, including human societies, can be complex to navigate. When interacting with an array of social partners and enemies, social smarts can be of great value.</p>
<p>But some animal societies have been shaped by evolution such that internal conflict is minimized; this often happens when the group members are closely related, and when strong competition among groups favors group coordination and performance. Some features of these societies can then evolve in response to natural selection at the level of the group, rather than the individual.</p>
<p>When individual interests align with the group as a whole, we can think of the society as a super-organism. We can then explore how natural selection on groups might drive the evolution of specializations among group members. We expect these specializations to enhance group performance or efficiency. Could group selection actually favor a reduction of brain investment in some group members?</p>
<h3><strong>Comparing castes</strong></h3>
<p>We used the superorganism framework to study patterns of brain investment among the members of insect societies, particularly, of army ants. Social insect colonies are famously divided into castes: classes of individuals that play distinct roles in the social group (for example, think of the reproductive queens versus the sterile, helping workers in a honey bee colony).</p>
<p>Army ants have some of the most dramatic, complex caste systems known: not only are their queens distinctly different, the worker force is divided into three or even four distinct body types, each of which performs different jobs for the colony.</p>

<p>Among army ant castes, the soldiers in the genus <em>Eciton</em> stand out as being rather behaviorally limited. Soldiers are specialized defenders. They have large, muscle-filled heads that drive long, powerful mouthparts shaped like ice tongs.</p>
<p>They are effective at tracking down, biting, and stinging enemies – mostly birds and mammals, including field biologists. But they do little else. Soldiers cannot carry the young during colony emigrations, or hunt and kill prey. Soldiers cannot even feed themselves.</p>
<p>Do soldiers have reduced brain investment, as expected based on their simple behavioral repertoire? Our data suggest the answer is yes.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10381" style="width: 686px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10381 size-full" height="496" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Same-scale-3-D-reconstructions-of-head-capsules-e1531392762587.jpg" width="676" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Same-scale 3-D reconstructions of head capsules and brains of army ant (<em>Eciton burchellii parvispinum</em>) worker (A) and soldier (B). The scale bar represents 0.5 mm. Brain structures are the colored bodies in the center of each head capsule. Dark blue: learning/memory region; Light blue: chemical processing region.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We measured head size and brain region volumes in several species of <em>Eciton</em> army ants, comparing workers of different sizes and soldiers in each species. Even though worker brain volume increased with body size, that increase slowed or stopped in the soldiers; even though soldiers were larger than the workers, their brains were similar in size.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two key brain regions were smaller than expected based on soldiers’ overall brain size: a region that processes chemical information, and another region that is critical for learning and memory.</p>
<p>These findings are exciting because they support the idea that natural selection for colony efficiency can favor the evolution of reduced brain investment in some group members, when a caste has limited behavioral demands. It appears<em> Eciton </em>soldiers give new meaning to the term, “meat head.”</p>

<p>Around the world, more people than ever are locked up in prisons – estimated to be in excess of 11 million people, up by almost 20 per cent since the turn of the millennium (<a href="http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_prison_population_list_11th_edition_0.pdf">pdf</a>). According to a recent House of Commons <a href="http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Allen_Dempsey_2016.pdf">Briefing Paper</a> the rate of increase is even higher than this in the UK where prison populations are at a record high. Many of these incarcerated individuals have intensifying mental health needs – for instance, the same briefing paper reports that UK rates of self-harm in prisoners were 25 per cent higher in 2015 than in 2014. Ahead of this week’s meeting of the <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/all-party-parliamentary-group-psychology">All Party Parliamentary Group for Psychology</a> on the topic of Mental Health in the Criminal Justice System, here we provide a digest of research into the mental health of prisoners.</p>
<p><span id="more-34216"></span></p>
<p><strong>Prisoners are at much higher risk of mental health problems than the general population</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550330">a systematic review</a> published in 2012, involving data from over 30,000 prisoners worldwide from 24 different countries, around 12 per cent of prisoners have a diagnosis of depression and nearly 4 per cent have a diagnosis of psychosis (compared with approximately 4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, in the general population). Other mental health conditions are also more common among prison populations than the general public, including substance misuse and personality disorders. The statistics show that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180411-locked-up-and-vulnerable-when-prison-makes-things-worse">women prisoners seem to be at especially high risk of mental health problems</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prisoners are at elevated risk of suicide</strong></p>
<p>These greater mental health vulnerabilities also manifest in much higher suicide rates among prison populations than among the general public. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036617304303">A study</a> published last year analysed prison suicides across 24 countries between 2011 to 2014. This revealed a threefold increased suicide risk among male prisoners, and a ninefold increased risk of suicide among female prisoners, compared with the general population. The study also measured a number of prison factors to see if these correlated with suicide rates, such as over-crowding and the staff-prisoner ratios, but none of them did. “There are no simple ecological explanations for prison suicide,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>An unresolved issue is whether prison causes mental health problems or people with mental health problems are more likely to go to prison</strong></p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS2215-0366(16)30142-0">review</a> in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> described this question as a “key issue” for the field, citing in favour of the “importation” argument two studies that suggested offending rates are higher than average among people with a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25110636">schizophrenia</a> or <span style="color: #00aadc;"><u>depression</u></span>, which could account for the elevated rates of these diagnoses among prison populations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small British <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/prospective-cohort-study-of-mental-health-during-imprisonment/76CC2340DD5DB3D2723EE81D91276020/core-reader">study</a> published in 2011 found that rates of depression actually decreased, and rates of psychosis remained stable, among the prisoners they followed for two months from the beginning of their sentence. “It appears that the first 2 months of imprisonment do not have a universally detrimental impact on mental health, even among those with pre-existing mental illnesses,” the researchers said (other researchers have previously <a href="https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449200701682436">suggested</a> that the relative safety of prisons, the structure, and access to psychiatric care could be responsible for symptom improvements, and there is even research on <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306624X14548531">post-traumatic growth in prison</a> through finding meaning in the experience).</p>
<p>Note, however, that the pattern in the 2011 study was somewhat different for women prisoners, who did not show declines in symptoms. “The notion that women are differently and disproportionately affected by imprisonment is well supported in the literature,” the researchers added. The study also showed that symptom prevalence among prisoners was highest during the first week in prison: “Our findings confirm that the first week of custody continues to represent a period of heightened distress and risk among all newly received prisoners,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>Several pre-incarceration factors have been found to correlate with increased risk of prisoner mental health problems</strong></p>
<p>While the debate continues around whether and what factors of prison increase risk of mental illness, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252717301255">study</a> published this year that assessed over 750 prisoners from two UK prisons found multiple “imported factors” that were associated with increased risk of having a mental health problem in prison (in this study, around 40 per cent the prisoners had a mental health problem).</p>
<p>These factors included: describing oneself a worrier; being impulsive; having difficulty getting on with others; having been a victim of sexual abuse in childhood (see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302137">also</a>); and having learning difficulties at school. “[P]ersonality type may be one area well worth exploring when carrying out initial intake assessments and designing regime or individual sentence plans, as it appears certain dispositions may be useful predictive markers [for risk of mental health issues],” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Counter-intuitively, having a previous prison sentence, past substance abuse problems and being unemployed prior to prison were all associated with lower risk of mental health problems in prison (at a statistically significant level or showing a trend in that direction). “A possible explanation for this finding is that the presence of these factors may make the adoption of a prisonized identity an easier process, which in turn eases mental stress,” the researchers said (for more on the processes of “prisonisation” – i.e. how prison changes people – see <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180430-the-unexpected-ways-prison-time-changes-people">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to perpetuate and be the victims of violence</strong></p>
<p>A US Department of Justice report (<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf">pdf</a>) found that prisoners with mental health problems were more likely to have been charged with physical or verbal assault and more likely to have been injured in a fight, compared with prisoners without mental health issues. Other research has highlighted how prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to be victimised: for instance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811043/">another US study</a> found that 1 in 12 male prisoners with a mental health diagnosis reported sexual victimisation by another inmate, compared with 1 in 33 male prisoners without a mental health diagnosis. Prisoners with mental health problems are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836899/">also at increased risk of physical assault by others</a>.</p>
<p><strong>There is a lack of quality research on interventions for prisoners with mental health needs</strong></p>
<p>Given the high rates of mental health problems among prison populations, there is a worrying lack of large-scale intervention studies. The recent <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008459/#R17">review</a> of mental health issues in prisons stated that this is likely due to organisational challenges, lack of funding, and “a perceived division of prisoner health from public health in general”. There is some limited evidence for beneficial effects for prisoners of programmes based around CBT, DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) and Yoga. “But the effect sizes are not large; [it remains unclear] whether they would hold in better quality designs (e.g. using active controls and not waiting list or treatment as usual controls), and it is uncertain whether any improvements are sustained,” the review states. It goes on to recommend that “More evidence is required to determine which psychological therapies are most effective for mental health problems in prison, and whether they can be provided in a group-based formats.” Findings from the community may not generalise to the community, the review authors warn, because of the unique challenges in prison of “the increased structures, different rules, housing, and access to drugs”.</p>
<p>Regarding the prison drug problem, a recent <a href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/07/HMIP-AR_2014-15_TSO_Final1.pdf">report</a> by the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales warned about the “rapid increase in the availability of new psychoactive substances (new drugs such as ‘Spice’ and ‘Black Mamba’ that are developed or chosen to mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cannabis, heroin or amphetamines and may have unpredictable and life-threatening effects)…” and it stated that these drugs have been linked with “problems such as bullying, debt and medical emergencies requiring hospitalisation”.</p>

<p><i>By guest blogger</i> <a href="http://www.multipledrafts.com/">Dan Jones</a></p>
<p>Amid all the talk of a “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a>” in psychology, here’s a rare good news story – a new project has found that a sub-field of the discipline, known as “experimental philosophy” or X-phi, is producing results that are impressively robust.</p>
<p>The current crisis in psychology was largely precipitated by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">a mass replication attempt</a> published by the Open Science Collaboration (OSC) project in 2015. Of 100 previously published significant findings, only 39 per cent replicated unambiguously, rising to 47 per cent on more relaxed criteria.</p>
<p>Now a paper in <em>Review of Philosophy and Psychology</em> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-018-0400-9">has trained the replicability lens on the burgeoning field of experimental philosophy</a>. Born roughly 15 years ago, X-Phi takes the tools of contemporary psychology and applies them to unravelling how people think about many of the major topics of Western philosophy, from the metaphysics of free will and the nature of the self, to morality and the problem of consciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34238"></span></p>
<p>Take one of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8284.00419">earliest and most well-known findings from the field</a>. Back in 2003, Joshua Knobe, now at Yale University, set out to study what determines whether we describe the outcome of someone’s behaviour as intentional or not. Knobe ran two short vignettes by his participants. One described the CEO of a company being brought a new business plan by his VPs that would cause harm to the environment. The CEO says “I don’t care about harming the environment, go ahead”. The project proceeds and the environment is duly hurt.</p>
<p>In that case, most people say that the CEO intentionally harmed the environment. But switch the word “harm” to “help” and now people are reluctant to say that the CEO intentionally helped the environment, even though in both cases the CEO was indifferent to harming or helping the environment as a side effect of his business activities. This asymmetry, known as the <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/good-bad-and-intentional">Knobe effect</a>, revealed how moral considerations affect our deployment of ostensibly non-moral concepts, like intentionality.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>X-Phi has generated great excitement making it essential to see whether the pall of the replicability crisis darkens this field too. So the X-Phi Replicability Project (XRP) – a collaboration between twenty research teams in eight countries, devised by Brent Strickland of the Institut Jean Nicod, Paris, France and led by Florian Cova of the Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, Switzerland – set about re-running a representative sample of 40 X-Phi studies to see how the field is holding up (the sample comprised the most cited X-Phi papers from 2003-2015, two random papers for each year, and a few extra to bring the total to 40).</p>
<p>There are numerous criteria that can be used for determining whether a study replicates or not. The XRP used three: a subjective assessment by the replicating team; whether the replication achieved a statistically significant result in the same direction as the original study; and whether the effect sizes of the original and replication studies were comparable. The XRP found that X-Phi studies replicated 78 per cent of the time according to the first two criteria, and 71 per cent of the time judged by the third – way better than the 39-47 per cent for psychology as whole, although other specific sub-fields like <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/">cognitive psychology</a> have also reported promising results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s wonderful news,” says Knobe. “And it’s a bit ironic, because the whole approach of X-Phi was modelled on the techniques used in the rest of psychology, yet we ended up with this higher replicability!”</p>
<p>Why is X-Phi doing so well? A big part of the field’s success seems to come from the kinds of studies it focuses on. Specifically, 78 per cent of the studies in the XRP sample were “content-based”, meaning they looked at how participants’ behaviour, beliefs or judgments changed depending on the task or stimuli they were given (e.g., Knobe’s changing of the word “harm” to “help” to elicit different judgments about intentional behaviour), rather than being observational or demographic-based (looking at aspects of individuals that predict differences in outcome), for instance. And such content-based studies – whether in psychology as a whole or in X-Phi – replicate better than other kinds of study: 90 per cent replicated in the XRP sample (compared to 21-31 per cent for other designs), and 65 per cent in the OSC sample. Notably, content-based studies comprised just 34 per cent on the OSC sample – less than half the proportion found in X-Phi – giving X-Phi a higher overall replicability rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the effect sizes studied in the predominantly content-based studies of X-Phi might typically be larger than in the rest of contemporary psychology – and as the OSC found, studies that report large effect sizes tend to replicate better. One reason for this could be that the effects X-Phi explores are powerful enough to be available to introspection. The Knobe effect, for example, has an intuitive, natural feel to it – one that Knobe sensed but needed to confirm empirically. And the XRP found that early X-Phi studies tended to produce especially large effect sizes, adding plausibility to the idea that they tapped into low-hanging, introspectively visible psychological fruit.</p>
<p>A cluster of other factors may be giving X-Phi a boost. X-Phi studies tend to be cheaper and easier to run than in many areas of psychology. Often, all you need are some written vignettes and a few questions about them, and a way of delivering this material to people – a process made easy by the widely used Amazon Mechanical Turk survey platform. That means that researchers may be less invested in a given study, and feel less pressure to “p-hack” the data to produce a positive, publishable, but ultimately unreliable, result. This take is backed up by the XRP’s statistical analysis that found less evidence of p-hacking in X-Phi compared to psychology generally. What’s more, X-Phi researchers also seem to be more comfortable publishing null or negative results: while such papers comprised just 3 per cent of the total in the OSC, they made up 10 per cent of XRP’s sample.</p>
<p>The success of X-Phi can’t be emulated by simply choosing to investigate psychological phenomena with large effect sizes. Nor does the high replicability of content-based studies mean that psychologists should restrict their research to these kinds of studies, which Knobe says would be absurd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Florian Cova agrees, but says that the fact that some study designs tend to produce more robust findings than others should not be ignored. “If we know that certain kinds of studies are more likely to produce fragile results or false positives, we can adjust our study designs in these cases to try to minimise these risks.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the broadest lesson for other psychologists is the importance of basing studies on detailed theories, rather than just looking for interesting or quirky psychological phenomena. “Research in X-Phi is usually driven by a rich theory that predicts what we should expect to happen,” says Knobe. Such theory-driven research could make null results more palatable and take the pressure off needing to find some positive result to squeeze out of the data. “If we run a study in which the predicted effect doesn’t occur, that null result is still a publishable finding because it speaks to whether the theory is true or not.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/AYAHUASCA-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>For any of the 300 million individuals worldwide suffering from depression, a fast-acting, effective treatment can mean the difference between life and death. Yet despite the growing number of pharmaceutical agents advertising relief from sadness, replaced by joy and contentment, their efficacy is often staggeringly slow and poor. In contrast to the promise of immediate happiness, many drugs can leave patients numb, lethargic, fighting unpleasant side-effects, and sometimes even more deeply depressed. A likely reason for the failure of many past anti-depressants is our still incomplete understanding of the neurobiological bases for this debilitating disease. This knowledge gap precludes efforts to ease depression through chemical means. Hence, the search continues for a rapid-acting, reliable therapy. Naturally available treatment options that offer little commercial incentive have remained overlooked by pharmaceutical research. However, mounting research suggests that nature may have provided an effective means to relieve depressive symptoms, in the form of a ceremonial psychedelic brew that’s been appreciated for centuries for its mind-altering and mood-enhancing properties. After early reports that ayahuasca may be a viable alternative to the countless failed pharmaceutical therapies, a team of Brazilian researchers put it to rigorous testing and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/rapid-antidepressant-effects-of-the-psychedelic-ayahuasca-in-treatmentresistant-depression-a-randomized-placebocontrolled-trial/E67A8A4BBE4F5F14DE8552DB9A0CBC97" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found promising anti-depressant effects</a> in this age-old spiritual medicine.</p>
<p><strong>A spiritual psychedelic brew</strong></p>
<p>Ayahuasca is an intoxicating brew used by Amazonian cultures for spiritual and medicinal purposes. It combines psychoactive plants containing the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and several monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Effects often last up to six hours, and include altered consciousness, sensory changes, introspection, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, vomiting, and in some cases, intense distress. Because ayahuasca can notably evoke mystical experiences and religious revelations, it has been widely used to promote spiritual awakening.</p>
<p><strong>Ayahuasca the anti-depressant </strong></p>
<p>Ayahuasca has previously been found to attenuate depression severity, but until now, its therapeutic potential had not been rigorously studied in a clinical trial. In their recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Dr. Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, and colleagues tested the drug in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. On average, these individuals were moderately to severely depressed and had tried nearly four anti-depressants without success.</p>
<p>Participants consumed a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo, after which they sat quietly under supervision while the drug took effect. Depression was assessed using two depression scales before the ayahuasca session and one, two and seven days after. Compared to patients who drank placebo, those who ingested the active brew reported fewer depressive symptoms as soon as a day later, with an even stronger reduction a week later (see Figure). By the end of the week, more patients in the ayahuasca group (64%) than the placebo group (27%) responded positively to the treatment. Although remission rates for the ayahuasca group (36%) were on average higher than placebo (7%), this difference was not significant, perhaps due to an unusually high placebo effect. The improvements in mood were not without unpleasant side-effects, notably nausea and vomiting.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19602"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression.jpeg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-19602" height="199" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression-300x199.jpeg" width="300" /></a>Depression ratings are lower for ayahuasca than placebo one to seven days after intake.</figure>
<p><strong>The depressed brain on psychedelics</strong></p>
<p>This trial was an important step towards validating ayahuasca as an anti-depressant, a treatment option implicated by only a handful of prior studies. Others found that ayahuasca elicits <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25806551">anti-depressant effects</a> up to three weeks and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650973" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alters brain blood flow</a>, but these studies were small and not placebo-controlled, the gold-standard for clinical testing. These mood-regulating benefits may not be limited to ayahuasca, as other psychedelics have similarly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036616300657" rel="noopener" target="_blank">small study</a> reported that psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, alleviated depressive symptoms a week to three months later, though this trial was not placebo-controlled. Several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894061" rel="noopener" target="_blank">randomized controlled trials</a> have demonstrated that the psychedelic anesthetic ketamine reduces depression symptoms as soon as two hours and up to one week later.</p>
<p>Besides offering hope for fighting depression, the rapid and robust benefits observed from ayahuasca provide valuable insight into the still mysterious neurobiological genesis of depression. To understand the mood-stabilizing powers of ayahuasca, we can look to its array of constituent chemicals. The pool of MAOIs in ayahuasca prevent the degradation of monoamines, a class of neurotransmitters implicated in depression that includes serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. The “monoamine hypothesis” of depression–which posits that monoamine deficits play a causal role–is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10775017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">considered inadequate</a> to fully explain the pathogenesis of depression. However, the benefits of ayahuasca support the theory that rebalancing monoamine neurotransmission can at least partly help to combat depression. Moreover, DMT is a serotonin agonist, meaning that it activates the brain’s serotonin receptors. However, existing drugs that act as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) also increase serotonergic activity through different means, but have relatively limited efficacy. By preventing the breakdown of several monoamines through its MAOI activity, rather than targeting a particular neurotransmitter that <em>may or may not</em> be deficient in the individual patient, ayahuasca may offer a more generalizable therapy than conventional serotonergic drugs.</p>
<p>These effects are likely augmented by DMT’s activation of sigma-1 receptors, which regulate calcium signaling and have been implicated in depression, among other psychiatric conditions. MAOIs and sigma-1 receptors also promote neurogenesis and increase brain growth factors, which may further help to regulate mood.</p>
<p><strong>The road to prescription</strong></p>
<p>Is ayahuasca the miracle drug we’ve long been awaiting to combat depression? Despite the promising evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, many outstanding questions need to be addressed before the psychedelic is prescribed in a clinical setting. The drug’s anti-depressant effects are fast-acting, but further research is needed to determine the duration of these effects and the optimal dosing regimen. Regular supervised, mind-altering trips that consume several hours may be impractical if frequent dosing is required. An equally pressing question is whether the side effects would preclude regular use and patient compliance. Though its non-addictive profile and absence of lasting changes to cognition or personality make ayahuasca an appealing option, the vomiting and hallucinations that often accompany the ayahuasca experience could be deal-breakers for patients desiring a less invasive therapy. Because psychedelic trips can sometimes be accompanied by negative experiences, including sensory or cognitive distortions, additional research is warranted to better characterize their neurobiological properties. Thus, it may be some time before the carefree laughter of an ayahuasca-user infiltrates the mass of TV drug advertisements. But at the very least, ongoing research into its antidepressant properties will bring us closer to understanding how our brain chemistry supports a healthy emotional state.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>We could say without exaggeration that the discovery of a means of achieving full control over oneself is something of a “holy grail” for psychology. There is nothing to indicate that we are getting any closer to finding one, but recent decades have brought us a growing number of discoveries that at least partially allow us to enhance self-control mechanisms. One of them is the light which has been shed on the importance of rituals in boosting self-control. Now in a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-22169-001">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, Allen Ding Tian and his collaborators have examined whether enacting rituals (defined as “a fixed episodic sequence of actions characterised by rigidity and repetition”) can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioural self-control.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34223"></span></p>
<p>The researchers planned and carried out six interesting experiments. For the first they recruited 93 undergraduate women at a gym who had a goal of losing weight. All participants received the same instructions to try to reduce their calorie intake over a 5-day period, but half were told to be “mindful” about their food consumption, whereas the other half were taught a three-step pre-eating ritual to remind them to reduce calorie intake. Before every meal they had to cut their food into pieces before consuming it. Next, they rearranged the pieces so that they were perfectly symmetric on their plates, and finally they had to press their eating utensils against the top of their food three times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It appears that rituals really can boost self-control. Participants who enacted a pre-eating ritual reported significantly lower calorie consumption than those who attempted to be mindful about what they ate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers decided to replicate this study in a laboratory and find out if any random gestures would have the same beneficial effect as repeated rituals. The participants learned they would be completing a taste test of carrots and chocolate. They received four bags from the experimenter: three contained a baby carrot, one a chocolate truffle. First, they had to eat two carrots, while preceding each act of eating with either: the exact same set of ritual movements (involving knocking the table with their knuckles, closing their eyes and counting, among other things); a set of random gestures that were similar to the ritual movements but different each time (so they didn’t resemble a ritualised script); or no behaviour. Next, the participants could choose whether to eat the remaining carrot or the truffle. Participants who had enacted a ritual before eating the first two carrots tended to make the healthier choice compared with individuals in the other groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two further experiments involved participants either twice enacting a ritualised set of movements (though they were not labelled as such); performing one set of random gestures; or doing nothing (control group). Then they made a choice between a Snickers bar or a healthy Odwalla bar. Again, the ritual group showed greater self-control and this seemed to be driven by the way that rituals boosted their feelings of self-discipline (as measured by their agreement with statements like “I felt mentally strong when making this decision”).</p>
<p>A fourth experiment assessed the effect of rituals in another self-control context—prosocial decision-making. Participants were asked to imagine that they had been invited to a friend’s party that would be a lot of fun. They were then informed that they had received an unexpected email from an affiliated charity organisation requesting their attendance that same evening at a public fundraiser. They must decide which event to go to, but before taking the decision, one group of the participants twice performed a series of ritual movements, while other groups either engaged in a one-off series of random gestures, or they took their decision immediately. The link between performing rituals and greater self-discipline was confirmed again with the ritual group showing a greater preference for the charity fundraiser.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A final experiment in the series demonstrated that rituals only affect decision making when a self-control conflict is involved (such as choosing between a fundraiser and party), not when choosing between two options where self-control is not an issue (such as choosing between two fun parties).</p>
<p>Note that, unlike cultural rituals, all of the rituals used in the experiments were devoid of meaning. Incorporated into various spheres of our lives, cultural rituals sometimes contribute to improving self-discipline, but there are also others which induce us to abandon self-control; these include rituals surrounding the shared consumption of celebratory meals, during which excessive self-discipline can even be taken as rudeness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results of the presented studies are quite promising for anyone who would like to boost their self-control, but the authors also demonstrate how many aspects of rituals remain unexplored. One of the more interesting questions that researchers may engage concerns the potential difference in increase in self-discipline with rituals created by individuals for their own purposes, and those adopted from or even imposed by the surrounding environment. Also, does the effectiveness of a ritual depend on the amount of effort put into it? Do rituals repeated often and without requiring attention also enhance self-control? All this remains to be explored by future research.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>The pursuit of new drugs to treat and cure human diseases is one of the noblest things in our civilization. However, 6 out of 10 drugs fail during the clinical trials, making the lengthy and expensive R&amp;D process a proverbial double-edged sword. High rates of failure are often attributed to the poor predictability of 2D cell cultures and animal models that are used to test drugs during the preclinical stage. The unreliability of these models is why researchers are turning to “mini organs” in a dish, popularly known as organoids, to better understand the effects of experimental drugs on human organs. Organoids are miniaturized 3D replicas of human organs that are created by culturing stem cells or progenitor cells in a medium simulating extracellular matrix (ECM) properties.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organoids have numerous impactful applications, but their applicability in disease modeling is especially noteworthy. They can be used to recapitulate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">human pathophysiology</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vitro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, providing a golden opportunity to study and treat human diseases in a 3D environment. Organoids for all major organs have already been produced. For example, gastrointestinal organoid tissues, liver-on-a-chip models, and lung-on-a-chip models are made available by </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ocello"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OcellO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/braingineering-technologies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braingineering Technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/alveolix-bern"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AlveoliX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respectively. </span></p><p>This organoid technology has the potential to transform the field of precision medicine. The day when a scientist will be able to completely diagnose and cure people using their simulated forms in vitro does not seem so far away. Science Exchange believes this technology can do a world of good for R&amp;D, which is why we have established an exhaustive network of qualified providers to make organoid products and services readily available.

In April 2015, two high-profile chemistry bloggers — and their commenters — raised questions about a paper that had been published in PLOS ONE some 18 months earlier. More than three years later, the journal has now retracted the paper, with a notice that echoes the 2015 blog posts. So what took so long?

margin-bottom: 0cm;">Over three months ago (in March) the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) published a <a href="https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/393-springer-nature-and-vsnu-renew-agreement-on-open-access-publishing.html">very brief news item</a> announcing that it had reached agreement with Springer Nature on a new OA Big Deal. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Curious as to the details of the agreement, I invited VSNU to answer some questions, both about the Springer Nature deal and VSNU’s f<a href="https://vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/394-no-agreement-with-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-publishing%C2%A0.html">ailure to reach agreement </a>with the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), concerning which another short news item had been published at the same time. VSNU’s Spokesperson and Advisor Public Affairs Bart Pierik agree to answer my questions.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">When I sent my list of questions to him, however, Pierik appeared to change his mind. “Considering the fact that we are finalising some more deals with publishers at this moment (we just published <a href="https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news-items/nieuwsbericht/396-oxford-university-press-and-vsnu-reach-agreement-on-100-open-access-deal.html">good news about Oxford University Press</a>) my proposal is that we would be glad to make one Q&amp;A in April about all of these deals,” he emailed me.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">I was disappointed but decided instead to write something <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-open-access-big-deal-back-to-future.html">more wide-ranging</a> about the growing number of OA Big Deals we can see being agreed between legacy publishers and the research community and to mention VSNU in that larger piece.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">I concluded that article by again inviting VSNU to answer my questions, adding, “By doing so they can help shine a light on this somewhat crepuscular corner of scholarly communication and demonstrate that <i>affordability</i> and <i>transparency</i> are just as important as <i>accessibility</i>.”</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">April came and went, and I assumed my questions had fallen into a black hole somewhere never to be seen again. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">To my surprise, however, this morning I received an email from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wezenbeek/">Wilma Van Wezenbeek</a>, Programme Manager Open Access at VSNU.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Not only did Van Wezenbeek attach answers to my questions but she informed me that VSNU has now published the contracts it has signed with both Springer Nature and Taylor &amp; Francis (although Springer Nature has not permitted VSNU to disclose their general terms and conditions).</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">I publish below both the email and the Q&amp;A, as I received them.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">The only other comment I would make at this stage is that it seems to me that if OA advocates and the wider research community want to see greater transparency over the rising number of OA Big Deals that universities, consortia and funding agencies are now signing with publishers on their behalf they are going to have to push hard. And they are going to have to keep pushing. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">The email</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>Dear Richard Poynder,</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>It has been a while that you sent Bart Pierik a list of questions to be answered by us.
