<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/business-792176_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>This week in the UK we’ve been experiencing a heat wave which has left many sweltering in the sun and seeking any available shade. We all know the dangers of sun exposure to our skin but we perhaps overlook the important benefits that it provides through vitamin D synthesis.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is important for the body in several ways and possessing inadequate amounts has been linked to autoimmune conditions; metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders; as well as cancers and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>We can obtain vitamin D through our diets but an estimated 90% is produced endogenously in healthy adults. To do this our bodies synthesize vitamin D from solar ultraviolet B radiation, making sunlight an essential factor in obtaining recommended vitamin D levels.</p>
<h3><strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide and even those in sunny locations are at risk of being deficient. Modern occupations trending towards indoor work are likely to play a big role in this as decreased time spent outdoors would be expected to lead to decreased vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>In order to more fully understand the role that occupations play on vitamin D levels and identify those groups at the greatest risk, researchers at the University of Alberta,  Canada performed a systematic review of 71 papers with large population based cohorts that defined occupational groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%).</p></blockquote>
<p>It was found that across all occupational groups, serum 25-(OH)D levels (a measure of vitamin D status in individuals) were below recommendations for optimal levels that are recommended by the Endocrine Society.</p>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%). Deficiency levels for practicing physicians, nurses and a group termed ‘other healthcare employees’ were all below 50%.</p>
<p>The findings of the study are consistent with an assumption that workers in an indoor environment would display lower levels of vitamin D compared to those working in outdoor environments.</p>
<p>The author’s state that the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in healthcare students and medical residence (72% and 65% respectively) could be due to long working hours combined with additional time spent studying, leading to considerable time spent indoors. This is an alarming find given low vitamin D in young adults may decrease bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis later in life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most worrying statistic is the high levels of vitamin D deficiency seen in shift workers. This deficiency has previously been suggested to be associated with shift workers’ predisposition for musculoskeletal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However drawing conclusions on this is complicated given that shift workers may work at various times of the day and may spend more time in daylight outside of conventional working hours.</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical implications</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the high prevalence vitamin D deficiency in shift workers, the authors call for regular screenings of these and other high risk groups to be considered in future clinical practice guidelines. They also call for education on the importance of healthy vitamin D levels, both through sun exposure and dietary intake, to be incorporated into workplace wellness programs.</p>
<p>For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside, giving their skin more exposure to UV light. This could be aided by revised work schedules allowing for such breaks.</p>
<p>So whether you’re parked by a fan in the midst of a heat wave or confining yourself to an office all day, provided that you avoid excessive exposure, it may be a good idea to venture outside and soak up some sun.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/doctor-563429_960_720-medical-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Stepping up from medical student to junior doctor is known to be a daunting and challenging transition. Though being stretched and ‘thrown in the deep end’ can be beneficial to their learning experience, it also increases stress. While getting to grips with the role in long shifts, they are also responsible for patient care. Can their job role and commitment for patient care be associated with poorer self-care?</p>
<p>This question was investigated by researchers at the <em>Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland</em>, in a <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0931-2">study</a> led by Dr. Sturman, who reported the experiences junior doctors had during their career development.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-9183 alignright" height="226" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/medical-563427_960_720-pixabay-300x200.jpg" width="339" />
<p>Junior doctors were recruited from a range of hospital settings, and interviewed to find out about their experiences when adjusting from the role of medical student to junior doctor. After this process, two clinical academics and an intern conducted a descriptive analysis of the information collected.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, some persistent concepts arose. Three main themes were ‘steep learning curve’, ‘relationships and team’ and ‘seeking help’. “There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student” one interviewee said. Overall, the participants described the transition as physically, mentally and emotionally draining.</p>
<p>Key experiences were a decrease in confidence, self-care and social wellbeing. It seems that while the juniors were focused on caring for others, and were happy to raise patient related concerns  with senior staff members, there was an unwillingness to voice their own personal problems.</p>
<p>To try and understand the cause for this, the researchers suggest some key factors in the professionals’ working environment, which may contribute to these negative impacts.</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain.</p></blockquote>
<p>The supportive team structure which can alleviate the stress of this experience may be hindered by a divide being in place between senior staff and the junior doctors, as one participant implied – “You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain”.</p>
<p>Disconnection between the staff can be further exacerbated by the movement of professionals to and from various teams within the hospital. As shallow relationships are maintained, not only the social wellbeing of the junior doctors, but their skills could be affected.</p>
<p>This study speaks out to medical educators to raise awareness of the personal detriments experienced by junior doctors in this phase of learning, and suggests that improved team support systems and teaching methods could help smooth the bumpy transition from student to professional.</p>
<blockquote><p>The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also voices the lessons learnt by junior doctors who have been through this stressful change, as one interviewee said “The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along, don’t be afraid to ask questions because ultimately it’s all in the best interest of the patient.”</p>
<p>If the wellbeing of junior doctors were to improve, perhaps this could also have a positive impact on their colleagues, and even the patients that they treat.</p>

<p>The horrific killing of Catherine “Kitty” Genovese in New York in 1964 inspired research into what’s known in social psychology as the Bystander Phenomenon – our increased disinclination to intervene when in the company of others. That’s because early reports told how 38 witnesses to Genovese’s murder did nothing to help. But in fact it’s now clear that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/23/the-truth-behind-the-story-of-kitty-genovese-and-the-bystander-effect/">several people did intervene</a>. So the tragedy that inspired research into the Bystander Phenomenon is actually a bad example of that real phenomenon.</p>
<p>But it’s not time yet to leave the sad story alone. As psychologist Saul Kassin documents <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616679465">in <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em></a>, hidden in the story in plain sight all these decades is an example of another important psychological principle: the power of false confessions. Moreover, in another twist, details have emerged recently of how a few days after her murder, Genovese’s killer, Winston Moseley, was initially detained by members of the public – ironically, given how the Genovese case inspired research into bystander apathy, these bystanders chose to act.</p>
<p><span id="more-25651"></span></p>
<p>Kassin’s perspective on all this is that he has spent years studying the psychology of false confessions, including the surprising number of people who make them, as shown for example by the high proportion of people exonerated by new DNA evidence whose past confessions turn out to have been false. His research has also shown the power of false confessions to sway jurors and witnesses (for instance, on hearing a false confession, witnesses for the defence often lose faith in their own testimony).</p>
<p>This ties into the murder of Kitty Genovese because it seems highly likely that her killer, Winston Moseley, was also responsible for the murder of 15-year-old Barbara Kralik a year earlier, a crime for which high-school drop-out Alvin Mitchell was already on trial.</p>
<p>Mitchell had confessed to Kralik’s murder – so he must have done it, right? Well, his confession came following more than 50 hours of interrogation and he soon recanted it. His first trial ended in a hung jury (11 votes for acquittal, 1 for conviction). However, the power of a confession, even one that’s retracted, does not fade easily. On retrial, Mitchell was found guilty and served 12 years, 8 months in prison. He insisted on his innocence throughout his prison stay and does so today.</p>
<p>Kassin makes a highly persuasive case for Mitchell being innocent of Kralik’s murder and the case being an exemplar of the power of false confessions (if you can get access, it’s worth reading Kassin’s <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616679465">entire article</a> to appreciate the full detail of the seemingly flawed case against Mitchell).</p>
<p>Kassin believes Moseley is the true killer of Kralik. Relevant here is that after his arrest for killing Genovese, Mosely also confessed to two more murders. He said he had killed 24-year-old Annie Mae Johnson one month earlier (this confession was corroborated in dramatic fashion after his account of the murder matched the wounds to Johnson’s body), and he said he had killed Kralik. Crucially, Moseley confessed with the same certainty and detail to both these additional murders while he steadfastly denied being responsible for another double-murder that was unsolved at the time time. Mosely repeated his confession to Kralik’s murder in Michell’s first trial. However, for some reason, he refused to provide the same testimony in the re-trial.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kassin travelled to rural Vermont to meet Michell, now in his 70s. Mitchell recalled how he was threatened and intimidated during the police interrogations. “I would have confessed to killing the president because them people had scared me to death,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are lessons to be learned from this part of the [Kitty Genovese] story,” writes Kassin. “The scientific study of police interrogations and confessions is well grounded in basic psychology … Collectively, this research has shown that innocent people can be induced to confess crimes they did not commit, that judges and juries have difficulty assessing confessions as a matter of common sense, and that reforms are needed to mitigate both sets of problems.”</p>
<p>What of the public bystanders who detained Moseley? This, says Kassin, is the “irony that slipped through the cracks”. Five days after he killed Genovese, Mosely was attempting to burgle a home in New York in broad daylight. A neighbour confronted him and disbelieving his excuse (Mosely said he was helping the owners move house) he incapacitated Moseley’s van and alerted another neighbour. This second neighbour called the police and Moseley was soon apprehended by officers nearby; within hours he had confessed to a string of burglaries and three murders, writes Kassin.</p>
<p>“Somehow this part of the Genovese story went unnoticed and without fanfare,” says Kassin. “In a most fitting, if not ironic, conclusion to Moseley’s crime spree, the perpetrator whose actions spawned the narrative of the non responsive urban bystander was capture precisely because of the intervention of urban bystanders!”</p>

<p>Image: This photograph of Kitty Genovese was used in newspaper reports at the time of her death, and Kassin notes that it is actually the mug shot taken of Genovese from when she had been arrested for a minor gambling offence. In a strange coincidence, the lawyer who represented Genovese for that offence, Sidney Sparrow, went on to be Winston Moseley’s assigned counsel.</p>

It was a great chance to learn more about how the physical and the mechanical properties of bacteria can impact their behaviour (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416306481?via%3Dihub">link</a>), about how the zebrafish model can be used to study tuberculosis pathogenesis (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867410001285?via%3Dihub">link</a>) and about the distinctions between the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, from a bioenergetics basis (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001926">link</a>).</p>
<p><strong>AMR, AMR… oh and AMR</strong></p>
<p>The single most central theme on ASM Microbe 2017 was antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – and rightly so. This was evident first from the address by <a href="https://www.asm.org/index.php/aam-fellows/aam-fellows/fellows-elected-in-2011/item/5011-susan-e-sharp">ASM President Susan Sharp</a>, who spoke about the urgency for a global “one health” solution on AMR. She discussed her representation of ASM at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly focused on AMR, where world leaders expressed concerns ranging from the basic needs of clean water and sanitation, access to effective antibiotics in lower income nations, to overutilization and misutilization of antibiotics in developed countries. ASM has established a multi-stakeholder initiative convening key experts to share and analyse the current status of AMR. We look forward to seeing how this unfolds in the medium term.</p>
<p>However the address on AMR did not end there. A session with the theme “Global response to antimicrobial resistance: can humans win this war?” offered further insight into the dissemination and control of AMR. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teresa_Coque">Teresa Coque</a> from the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital gave a thorough talk on the environmental dimension of AMR. She spoke about antimicrobial use, the absence of official legislation, about how the farm can affect hospitals and about the factors that influence antibiotic effects. <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/michihiko-goto">Michihico Goto</a> from the University of Iowa presented a high level strategy on how to control transmission of AMR in humans. Naturally, the talk focused heavily on hand hygiene and environmental/hospital cleanliness and really made us wonder: “how clean is clean enough?”. Finally, we attended a fantastic talk on positive stewardship interventions to reverse AMR and hospital acquired infections (HAIs) by <a href="http://pure.abdn.ac.uk:8080/portal/en/persons/ian-gould(91b2e4f3-b154-41b1-a415-4156b3868e0f).html">Ian Gould</a> from the University of Aberdeen. His talk ended with him presenting an interesting re-make of the song ‘Knocking on Heavens Door’ by Bob Dylan. Jump to the end of this blog to read the lyrics!</p>
<p><em>BMC Microbiology</em> recognises the trend on AMR and plans to respond soon with a new special issue on a very relevant and important topic – stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>A keynote address… out of this world!</strong></p>
<p>NASA astronaut and virologist <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/kathleen-rubins">Dr. Kate Rubins</a> delivered an inspiring keynote address about her journey through space. Her story about how it all started never seizes to amaze:</p>
<p><em>“I was procrastinating while applying for a grant when one of my friends found a federal government job posting for astronaut applications and encouraged me to apply for fun.”</em></p>
<p>She ended up being selected by NASA in 2009 between 18,000 applications. She then participated on an intense three year training course, which involved survival training in water and land, flying a T-38 supersonic fighter jet trainer (!), as well as learning how to do a spacewalk. Dr. Rubins completed her first spaceflight on Expedition 48/49, where she became the first person to sequence DNA in space. She spent 115 days in space and conducted two spacewalks.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9190" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9190 size-full" height="299" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/astro-kate.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">NASA</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Her stories about her time sequencing DNA at the International Space Station in the absence of gravity, paired with her knowledge on real-time data analysis, the importance of microbial environments in orbit, and emerging technologies, was a fascinating look into the power of the microbial sciences.</p>
<p>Dr. Rubins also spoke about the international nature of the team of astronauts and cosmonauts with which she spent countless hours training and working tirelessly as a unit, before and during their space trip. She sent a clear message against discrimination and she promoted unity, values that should rightly be elevated, especially in our times. It was very well received.</p>

We were delighted to interact with authors from all over the world and across disciplines, with funders and with government officials.</p>
<p>We wish we had brought more copies of <em>BMC Microbiology</em>’s latest <a href="https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-017-1012-8">review</a> by Section Editor <a href="https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board/editor-profiles#raffaele+zarrilli">Prof. Raffaele Zarrilli</a> and Associate Editor <a href="http://www.drasadlab.in/">Dr. Asad Khan</a> on the New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase and of <em>Microbiom</em>e’s <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0221-y">article</a> by Section Editor <a href="http://probiogenomics.unipr.it/ventura.html">Prof. Marco Ventura</a> and Associate Editors Dr. Christian Milani and Dr. Francesca Turroni on the ancient bacteria of the Ötzi’s microbiome.</p>
<p>We were excited to experience first-hand the impact that <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/open-access">Open Access</a> is having on the publishing industry. <em>BMC Microbiology</em> strives to fulfil BioMed Central’s values by being open and inclusive and it motivates us to see that the research community is endorsing our efforts.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1u6TF953ptY/nature23267">Unique roles for histone H3K9me states in RNAi and heritable silencing of transcription</a></h4>

<p>
 Heterochromatic DNA domains play important roles in regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability by silencing repetitive DNA elements and transposons. From fission yeast to mammals, heterochromatin assembly at DNA repeats involves the activity of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) associated with the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway1–9. Typically, sRNAs, originating from long noncoding RNAs, guide Argonaute-containing effector complexes to complementary nascent RNAs to initiate histone H3 lysine 9 di- and tri-methylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, respectively) and heterochromatin formation10–17. H3K9me is in turn required for recruitment of RNAi to chromatin to promote sRNA amplification11,15,18. Yet, how heterochromatin formation, which silences transcription, can proceed by a co-transcriptional mechanism that also promotes sRNA generation remains paradoxical. Here, using Clr4, the fission yeast S. pombe homolog of mammalian SUV39H H3K9 methyltransferases, we designed active site mutations that block H3K9me3, but allow H3K9me2 catalysis. We show that H3K9me2 defines a functionally distinct heterochromatin state that is sufficient for RNAi-dependent co-transcriptional gene silencing (CTGS) at pericentromeric DNA repeats. Unlike H3K9me3 domains, which are transcriptionally silent, H3K9me2 domains are transcriptionally active, contain modifications associated with euchromatic transcription, and couple RNAi-mediated transcript degradation to the establishment of H3K9me domains. The two H3K9me states recruit reader proteins with different efficiencies, explaining their different downstream silencing functions. Furthermore, transition from H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 is required for RNAi-independent epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me domains. Our findings demonstrate that H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 define functionally distinct chromatin states and uncover a mechanism for formation of transcriptionally permissive heterochromatin that is compatible with its broadly conserved role in sRNA-mediated genome defense.

<p>In 2005, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found an obesity researcher had engaged in scientific misconduct. More specifically, the ORI report revealed that Eric Poehlman, then based at the University of Vermont, had “falsified and fabricated” data in 10 papers. The 2005 report asked that the journals issue retractions or corrections to the papers. […]</p>

<p>Children are central to the <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. The 2030 agenda consists of 17 global goals with 169 targets between them which is measured by 230 specific indicators. 50 of these indicators are directly related to children. In 2015, child mortality for those aged under 5 was 5.9 million, which is almost 16,000 a day. It has been found that 83% of these deaths were due to infectious, neonatal, and nutritional conditions. China has seen a decline in under-5 mortality rate in the past 3 decades and it is one of the few countries to have achieved <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDG) 4 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/childhealth.shtml">reduce child mortality</a>) and 5 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml">improve maternal health</a>). Certain provinces in China have also been reported to have achieved this decrease in under-5 mortality rates <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)00093-3/fulltext">twice as fast</a> as the MDG 4 target rate. It has been <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">reported</a> that Chinese children’s health status has improved remarkably and the rate of infant mortality and under-five mortality continue to decline.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9180" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9180" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Image-by-Flickr-user-Micah-Sittig-CC-BY-2.0-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image by Flickr user Micah Sittig (CC BY 2.0)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>However, large disparities have also been found across the region. Although some provinces rivals the best results in the world with relation to under-5 mortality, the reality is very different in other provinces. Preterm birth, low birth weight, birth asphyxia, childhood pneumonia, and diarrhoea are amongst the major threats to infants in <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">some areas</a> of China. Efforts are therefore needed to address this <a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30360-6/fulltext">disparity</a> and to close such gaps in subnational units seen within China.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>A healthy diet and adequate nutrition is necessary to ensure optimum growth and development of children. About one third of child deaths worldwide are linked to malnutrition. This is a major health problem seen in China as well. <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">Climate change</a> also poses a new challenge in the control of undernutrition in this region, a matter which is already a concern particularly in poor rural areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_66188.html">Chronic nutritional deficiency</a> during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life can result in stunting where the damage caused to the child’s development is irreversible. It is estimated that in China, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eapro/media_20532.html">12.7 million</a> children are stunted, which is equivalent to the population size of Tokyo. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=27109127&amp;dopt=Abstract">national survey</a> carried out in China in 2013 showed that 8.1%, 2.4% and 1.9% of children under 5 years of age were stunted, underweight, and wasted, respectively. Results from a community based cross-sectional survey carried out by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cch.12148/full">Jiang and colleagues</a> in 84 villages in mid-western provinces of China in 2010 showed that malnutrition is a major public health problem among children and the prevalence of stunting and severe stunting was 27.0% and 13.2%, respectively. Location has been found to have a large impact on nutritional status in China. The risk of underweight and stunting is 3-4 times higher for children in rural areas than for those in cities.</p>
<p>Over the years improvements in these figures emerging from China can be seen. The level of undernourishment in the country was <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">reduced</a> from 23.9% in 1990 – 1992 to 9.3% in 2014 – 2016. Mortality in children under the age of 5 due to malnutrition also <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">dropped</a> from 22% to 13% between 2000 and 2010. Although the data illustrates that progress has been made resulting in a decline in stunting, underweight and wasting amongst children, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398816300320">prevalence of undernutrition</a> remains high for children under 5 in rural areas.</p>

<p>China is the world’s largest greenhouse-gas emitter. It has been reported that the peak in China’s emissions of such gases could come by <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">2025</a>, if not sooner. At the United Nations climate summit which took place in 2015, China committed to halting the growth in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 where the new plans call for a reduction of <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/china-s-carbon-emissions-could-peak-sooner-than-forecast-1.19597">18% in carbon dioxide</a> emission and a <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">15% decrease in energy consumption</a>. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. China has seen an increase of childhood asthma and there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801627">studies</a> emerging which demonstrate a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311080/">positive correlation</a> between high levels of outdoor pollution with children’s respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is evident that the world cannot reach a number of the SDG <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">targets</a> in the 2030 agenda unless the specific needs of children are monitored and addressed. Although improvements and progress have been seen in certain circumstances, there is still more that needs to be done to ensure that children are provided with the necessary to live healthy lives and achieve their full potential. More needs to be done to ensure that no child is left behind.</p>

<p>Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the presented paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst others
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We also include cascades of
independent clocks ("clock bags") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.</p>

<p>
 Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability, and silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid–liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.

<p>
 T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCRβ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/UsYgqhenEkY/nature22975">Host and viral traits predict zoonotic spillover from mammals</a></h4>

<p>
 The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host–virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range—which may reflect human–wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of ‘missing viruses’ and ‘missing zoonoses’ and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.

<p>
 Cellular potassium import systems play a fundamental role in osmoregulation, pH homeostasis and membrane potential in all domains of life. In bacteria, the kdp operon encodes a four-subunit potassium pump that maintains intracellular homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under conditions in which potassium is limiting. This membrane complex, called KdpFABC, has one channel-like subunit (KdpA) belonging to the superfamily of potassium transporters and another pump-like subunit (KdpB) belonging to the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Although there is considerable structural and functional information about members of both superfamilies, the mechanism by which uphill potassium transport through KdpA is coupled with ATP hydrolysis by KdpB remains poorly understood. Here we report the 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB. The structure also reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits. Specifically, a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. On the basis of these observations, we propose a mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes.

<p>
 Rotavirus, a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in young children, accounts for around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide. Rotavirus specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-κB signalling, raising the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses in intestinal mucosa. The mechanism by which enteric viruses are sensed and restricted in vivo, especially by NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes, is largely unknown. Here we uncover and mechanistically characterize the NLR Nlrp9b that is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and restricts rotavirus infection. Our data show that, via RNA helicase Dhx9, Nlrp9b recognizes short double-stranded RNA stretches and forms inflammasome complexes with the adaptor proteins Asc and caspase-1 to promote the maturation of interleukin (Il)-18 and gasdermin D (Gsdmd)-induced pyroptosis. Conditional depletion of Nlrp9b or other inflammasome components in the intestine in vivo resulted in enhanced susceptibility of mice to rotavirus replication. Our study highlights an important innate immune signalling pathway that functions in intestinal epithelial cells and may present useful targets in the modulation of host defences against viral pathogens.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5br55-bo1Ro/nature22822">Liquid droplet formation by HP1α suggests a role for phase separation in heterochromatin</a></h4>

<p>
 Gene silencing by heterochromatin is proposed to occur in part as a result of the ability of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins to spread across large regions of the genome, compact the underlying chromatin and recruit diverse ligands. Here we identify a new property of the human HP1α protein: the ability to form phase-separated droplets. While unmodified HP1α is soluble, either phosphorylation of its N-terminal extension or DNA binding promotes the formation of phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation-driven phase separation can be promoted or reversed by specific HP1α ligands. Known components of heterochromatin such as nucleosomes and DNA preferentially partition into the HP1α droplets, but molecules such as the transcription factor TFIIB show no preference. Using a single-molecule DNA curtain assay, we find that both unmodified and phosphorylated HP1α induce rapid compaction of DNA strands into puncta, although with different characteristics. We show by direct protein delivery into mammalian cells that an HP1α mutant incapable of phase separation in vitro forms smaller and fewer nuclear puncta than phosphorylated HP1α. These findings suggest that heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing may occur in part through sequestration of compacted chromatin in phase-separated HP1 droplets, which are dissolved or formed by specific ligands on the basis of nuclear context.

 Genetic studies have shown the association of Parkinson’s disease with alleles of the major histocompatibility complex. Here we show that a defined set of peptides that are derived from α-synuclein, a protein aggregated in Parkinson’s disease, act as antigenic epitopes displayed by these alleles and drive helper and cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with Parkinson’s disease. These responses may explain the association of Parkinson’s disease with specific major histocompatibility complex alleles.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1jLtDXpAlUg/nature22814">Trans-kingdom mimicry underlies ribosome customization by a poxvirus kinase</a></h4>

<p>
 Ribosomes have the capacity to selectively control translation through changes in their composition that enable recognition of specific RNA elements. However, beyond differential subunit expression during development, evidence for regulated ribosome specification within individual cells has remained elusive. Here we report that a poxvirus kinase phosphorylates serine/threonine residues in the human small ribosomal subunit protein, receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1), that are not phosphorylated in uninfected cells or cells infected by other viruses. These modified residues cluster in an extended loop in RACK1, phosphorylation of which selects for translation of viral or reporter mRNAs with 5′ untranslated regions that contain adenosine repeats, so-called polyA-leaders. Structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that although RACK1 is highly conserved, this loop is variable and contains negatively charged amino acids in plants, in which these leaders act as translational enhancers. Phosphomimetics and inter-species chimaeras have shown that negative charge in the RACK1 loop dictates ribosome selectivity towards viral RNAs. By converting human RACK1 to a charged, plant-like state, poxviruses remodel host ribosomes so that adenosine repeats erroneously generated by slippage of the viral RNA polymerase confer a translational advantage. Our findings provide insight into ribosome customization through trans-kingdom mimicry and the mechanics of species-specific leader activity that underlie poxvirus polyA-leaders.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/JZtaP7S5kxk/nature22383">Quantifiable predictive features define epitope-specific T cell receptor repertoires</a></h4>

<p>
 T cells are defined by a heterodimeric surface receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), that mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs are generated by genomic rearrangement of the germline TCR locus, a process termed V(D)J recombination, that has the potential to generate marked diversity of TCRs (estimated to range from 1015 (ref. 1) to as high as 1061 (ref. 2) possible receptors). Despite this potential diversity, TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, suggesting that it may be possible to predictively model epitope specificity. Here we report the in-depth characterization of ten epitope-specific TCR repertoires of CD8+ T cells from mice and humans, representing over 4,600 in-frame single-cell-derived TCRαβ sequence pairs from 110 subjects. We developed analytical tools to characterize these epitope-specific repertoires: a distance measure on the space of TCRs that permits clustering and visualization, a robust repertoire diversity metric that accommodates the low number of paired public receptors observed when compared to single-chain analyses, and a distance-based classifier that can assign previously unobserved TCRs to characterized repertoires with robust sensitivity and specificity. Our analyses demonstrate that each epitope-specific repertoire contains a clustered group of receptors that share core sequence similarities, together with a dispersed set of diverse ‘outlier’ sequences. By identifying shared motifs in core sequences, we were able to highlight key conserved residues driving essential elements of TCR recognition. These analyses provide insights into the generalizable, underlying features of epitope-specific repertoires and adaptive immune recognition.

<p>Thinking like a scientist is really hard, even for scientists. It requires putting aside your own prior beliefs, evaluating the quality and meaning of the evidence before you, and weighing it in the context of earlier findings. But parking your own agenda and staying objective is not the human way.</p>
<p>Consider that even though scientific evidence overwhelming supports the theory of evolution, a third of Americans think the theory is “absolutely false”. Similarly, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has contributed to climate change, yet around a third of Americans doubt it.</p>
<p>We Brits are just as blinkered. In a recent survey, over 96 per cent of teachers here said they believed pupils learn better when taught via their preferred learning style, even though scientific support for the concept is virtually non-existent. Why is it so hard to think like a scientist? In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742116300214">new chapter</a> in the <em>Psychology of Learning and Motivation</em> book series, Priti Shah at the University of Michigan and her colleagues have taken a detailed look at the reasons, and here we pull out five key insights:</p>
<p><span id="more-25462"></span></p>
<p><strong>We’re swayed by anecdotes</strong><br />
When making everyday decisions, such as whether to begin a new treatment or sign up to a particular class at uni, most of us are influenced more powerfully by personal testimony from a single person than by impersonal ratings or outcomes averaged across many people. This is the power of anecdote to dull our critical faculties. In <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2016.1139506?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">a study published last year</a> Fernando Rodriguez and his colleagues asked dozens of students to evaluate scientific news reports that drew inappropriate conclusions from weak evidence. Some of the reports opened with an anecdote supporting the inappropriate conclusion, other reports lacked an anecdote and acted as a control condition. Regardless of their level of university training or knowledge of scientific concepts, the students were less competent at critically evaluating the reports when they opened with an anecdote. “Anecdotal stories can undermine our ability to make scientifically driven judgements in real-world contexts,” the researchers said. Of course much health and science news in the mainstream media is delivered via anecdotes, increasing the likelihood that news consumers will swallow any claims whole.</p>
<p><strong>We’re overconfident</strong><br />
Confronted with a scientific claim, another reason many of us find it hard to reflect on it scientifically is that we overestimate our comprehension of the science. A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09636625030122001">study</a> from 2003 asked hundreds of university students to read several science news stories, to interpret them and rate their understanding. The students made many interpretative errors – for example, confusing correlation for causation – even though they thought they had a good understanding. This is redolent of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6228/abs/340011a0.html">a survey from the 1980s</a> of thousands of British and American citizens: nearly 60 per cent stated they were moderately or very well-informed about new science findings and yet far fewer were able to answer easy questions about elementary science. Part of the problem seems to be that we infer our understanding of scientific text based on how well we have comprehended the language used. This means that popular science stories written in layman’s language can contribute to false confidence. This “fluency bias” can also apply to science lectures: a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/05/14/engaging-lecturers-can-breed-overconfidence/">recent study</a> found that students overestimated the knowledge they’d derived from a science lecture when it was delivered by an engaging speaker.</p>
<p><strong>We’re biased by our prior beliefs</strong><br />
This obstacle to scientific objectivity was demonstrated by <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1981-05421-001">a now-classic study</a> from the 1970s in which participants were asked to evaluate scientific research that either supported or conflicted with their prior beliefs. For instance, one of the to-be-evaluated studies supposedly showed that murder rates tended to be lower in US states with the death penalty. Participants demonstrated an obvious bias in their evaluations. For example, if they supported capital punishment, they tended to evaluate the death penalty study favourably, whereas if they were against capital punishment, they were more likely to see the studies’ flaws. Scientific skills offer little protection against this bias, in fact they can compound it. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992">2013 study</a> asked participants to evaluate a piece of research on gun control. Participants with greater numeracy skills were especially biased: if the findings supported their existing beliefs, they were generous in their evaluation, but if the findings went against their beliefs, they used their skills to (in the words of Shah et al) “slam” the findings – a phenomenon dubbed “identity-protective cognition”.</p>
<p><strong>We’re seduced by graphs, formulas and meaningless neuroscience</strong><br />
It doesn’t take a lot to dazzle the average newspaper or magazine reader using the superficial props of science, be that formulas, graphics or jargon. Consider a study due for publication soon (Ibrahim et al, cited in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742116300214">new chapter</a>): researchers asked their participants to consider a news story about a correlational study into genetically modified foods that was either consistent with the bulk of past research showing that they are safe, or was inconsistent, suggesting that they are harmful. Additionally, the story was either accompanied or not by a scatterplot of the new findings. When the news story had a graphic visualisation of the <em>correlational</em> evidence, which was inconsistent with the weight of past research (i.e. it implied a possibility of harm), participants were far more likely to interpret the new evidence as showing genetically modified foods <em>cause</em> harm, than if they had read the same story without a graphic. “This is especially worrisome,” write Shah et al, “since it demonstrates how easily people can be convinced by new data, regardless of the actual scientific merit of the result.” Similar research into readers’ critical skills has shown that they are blinded in a comparable manner by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/17/psychology-students-are-seduced-by-superfluous-neuroscience/">gratuitous neuroscience jargon</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662514549688">meaningless formulas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Being smart isn’t enough</strong><br />
Even expert researchers suffer from the human foibles that undermine scientific thinking. Their critical faculties are contaminated by their agenda, by their ultimate motives for doing their experiments. This is why the open science revolution occurring in psychology is so important: when researchers make their methods and hypotheses transparent, and they pre-register their studies, it makes it less likely that they will be diverted, even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/">corrupted by,</a> confirmation bias (seeking out evidence to support their existing beliefs).</p>
<p>Take the example of systematic views in psychotherapy research: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/concerning-study-says-psychotherapy-research-has-a-problem-with-undeclared-researcher-bias/">a recent analysis</a> found that the conclusions of many are spun in a way that supports the researchers’ own biases. Other times, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/31/was-that-new-science-paper-hyped-and-over-interpreted-because-we-liked-its-message/">the whole scientific publishing community, from journals editors down to science journalists, seem to switch off their critical faculties</a> because they happen to agree with the message to emerge from a piece of research.</p>
<p>In their chapter, Shah and her colleagues point out that raw cognitive ability (IQ) is not a good predictor of a person’s ability to think like a scientist. More relevant is mental attitude, such as a person’s “need for cognition” and their ability or motivation to override gut instinct and reflect deeply. On a positive note, these mental dispositions may be more malleable, that is more trainable, than basic intelligence. But we’ll need plenty of solid evidence to test that.</p>

<p>The experiences of people who’ve been through a gender transition have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977075/">studied and analysed</a> by psychologists – showing, for example, improved psychological wellbeing and self-esteem after hormone treatment. But when it comes to their partners, there’s been much less research. According to a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407517709360?ai=1gvoi&amp;mi=3ricys&amp;af=R">new study</a> in the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i>, though, they often go through a kind of life transition of their own, and while there are certainly challenges, there are often positive changes, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-25437"></span></p>
<p>Lisa Platt at West Virginia University, US and Kayla Bolland at New Mexico State University conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 partners of transgender people – these partners were both female to male and male to female, plus there was a group that identified as gender neutral or fluid. The interviewees themselves were mostly not heterosexual, they lived in the US or Canada, and they included 13 cisgender women (women who’s gender identity matches their birth sex), 2 cisgender men, 4 transgender people, and 2 people with fluid or bi-gender identities.</p>
<p>Some of the interviewees had started their relationship after their transgender partner had transitioned; others were in their relationship before their partner had begun their transition process. Although there’s a common perception that relationships usually end when one member changes gender, this isn’t necessarily the case. For instance, in <a href="http://uh.edu/class/psychology/clinical-psych/research/dpl/_files/publications/Meier-Sharp-Michonski-Babcock-and-Fitzgerald_2013.pdf">one recent study</a>, about half of a group of transgender men who were in relationship before their transition kept up that relationship afterwards.</p>
<p>The interviews involved open-ended questions, such as “Discuss how your relationship has impacted your sexual orientation, if at all?”. Many of the participants reported practical safety concerns for their transgender partners, such as physical attacks from hostile members of the public. But there were concerns relating to their own psychological wellbeing, too. Most had previous connections in the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer) community, the researchers wrote, but as a partner of a transgender person, they felt excluded and marginalised.</p>
<p>For example, one woman whose partner had made a female to male transition (FTM) had previously identified as lesbian, but now identified as queer – a less-specific term for a non-straight sexual orientation. Many interviewees felt this better described their sexual orientation after their partner transitioned – they don’t feel straight, but not gay or lesbian any more, either. “Do we still fit in the lesbian community?” the woman asked, “it’s something we’re still trying to figure out.” Another interviewee, also a female partner of someone who had made the FTM  transition, said, “You do give up something as a partner because you’re all lesbians together and a lot of lesbians don’t like it when other lesbians transition. I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>One participant explained how she felt ignored. “Everything is always about trans people, trans people, trans people. And you know, partners are completely eclipsed – and our sexuality is completely eclipsed, and we have no voice in the community really.”</p>
<p>And yet, many reported undergoing major changes in their own lives. Physical changes to their partner meant changed sexual experiences, for example, and many reported questioning their own sexual orientation, or relabelling themselves (with the term queer, for instance). But some reported that this was a positive experience (“It’s definitely opened my eyes to helping me understand myself better and what I’m attracted to and not be putting myself in a box like I used to,” said one.) Some also talked about having a welcome, new understanding of the gender spectrum, and about how the need for more communication about what feels comfortable for both partners led to greater closeness and intimacy.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s important to remember, one interviewee stressed, “that as your partner transitions, what you’re going through is a transition of your own.”</p>
<p>Although this is a little-researched area, there are organisations that provide advice to partners of trans people:</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9161" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9161 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/5918018090_bdecd48937_z-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Takver on Flickr</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whilst research into the health of this vulnerable population is increasing, as shown in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0116-4">this</a> bibliometric analysis, published in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC International Health &amp; Human Rights</em></a> there are still many challenges on how best to reach and treat refugees.  Below we discuss a selection of <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC series</em></a> research into the health challenges experienced by refugees.</p>
<p>As many refugees have suffered physical or psychological stress it is perhaps unsurprising that mental health conditions are prevalent in the population. In a <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1239-9">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a> the prevalence of mental health illness amongst refugees and asylum-seekers in Australia was measured at 50.4%, with approximately a third having had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at some point. In a Danish <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1166-1">study</a> of refugees it was shown PTSD was sometimes accompanied by secondary psychotic symptoms, likely to be linked to severe interpersonal traumas such as torture and imprisonment.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3953-5">study</a> in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> the rates of depressive symptoms in African asylum-seekers and refugees in Hong Kong was examined. Whilst a significant proportion of this population exhibited depressive symptoms those who lived alone were more likely to suffer. In addition those who reported discrimination or difficulties accessing healthcare also had an increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms highlighting the value of social support.</p>
<p>A number of studies have looked at why refugee populations find healthcare difficult to access. Primary healthcare workers (HCWs) are aware of the issues refugees face and in this <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1048-6">study</a>, from Switzerland, HCWs identified a lack of adequate financial resources, housing, and access to employment as important factors in creating barriers to accessing healthcare. In addition the HCWs considered that a lack of information about services and a fear of stigmatization were preventing refugees from accessing mental healthcare.</p>
<p>Refugee youth are at elevated risk of mental health and alcohol and other drug problems and <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4186-y">this</a> study looking at refugee youths in South Australia highlighted a lack of awareness of services and the fragmented nature of them as causing major barriers to access.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9162" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9162" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/4263462042_407265e42e_z-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Evan Bench on Flickr</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In addition to mental health conditions there are other areas where refugees are at an increased risk. This <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-016-0085-z">study</a> showed that children of North Korean refugees in China had significantly lower vaccination rates compared to Chinese or migrant children. Unvaccinated children are at risk of many preventable infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and pertussis.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-017-0888-7">this study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Pediatrics</em></a> new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece were shown to commonly lack immunization records, have poor dental health and present with elevated blood lead levels. Many of the conditions reported were manageable but if undiagnosed or left untreated, could lead to poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>Doubtless the work discussed in this blog barely scratches the surface of the challenges facing refugee populations across the world. Clearly further research is needed and, even more importantly, concerted action required from governments and NGOs to tackle these issues and improve the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people</p>
