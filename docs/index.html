Recognizing this growing importance, <em>BMC Public Health</em> is expanding its global health content, and welcomes submissions in a wide range of multidisciplinary areas that coalesce around the research and practice of global health.</p>
<p><strong>To mark this new global health emphasis, Professor Mackey discusses why he became passionate about global health, his research interests, and where he sees the field of global health moving in the 21st century.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What inspired you to become a global health practitioner?</strong></em></p>

<p>As a child, my earliest memories were those living in foreign countries. Though born in the United States, my childhood was mostly spent living abroad due to my father’s work (who was a civil servant for the U.S. military). This included tours in the Philippines, Greece, Germany, and visiting Japan every year to see my maternal grandparents and relatives. It wasn’t until middle school that I would return to the United States, then experiencing the strange feeling of being a foreigner in my own “home” country.</p>
<p>However, the most profound impact of this experience was how it widened my perspective on the shared challenges we face as a global society and how it taught me that health is a common value that transcends national boundaries. Regardless of the different communities and countries I lived in and visited, all had a longing for the “attainment” of health and wellness, yet many did not have the means to ensure a healthier present or future.</p>
<p>This was especially true when I returned to the United States. We moved back to a community that had radically changed and shifted in socioeconomic demographics. The difference was drastic with our neighborhoods plagued with violence, substance abuse, failing schools, and all the signs of poverty, including lack of healthcare access and poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>This experience led me to a career in global health. I realized that improving population health through research, advocacy, and policy making is something that all communities need, whether it be local or global.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your research interests in global health?</em></strong></p>
<p>My primary research interests are looking at the impact of policy and governance on a variety of domestic and global health issues. This interest reflects my multidisciplinary background, which includes degrees in political science, health policy and law, and a doctorate in Global Public Health. It is also informed by where and the people I have worked with, which includes over 10 years’ experience in the private sector, my current career in academia, and consulting for organizations such as the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the U.S. Department of State, among others.</p>
<p>The reason why I am so interested in policy and governance is that it impacts everything around us. Global health programs cannot be successful without appropriate governance that enables them to effectuate sustainable change or prevent health emergencies. We are seeing this play out now with widespread scrutiny and calls for reform of the WHO following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, a topic I explore in a recent <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2016-y">article</a> published in <em>BMC Infectious Diseases.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, health interventions cannot be effective unless policy frameworks support their design and implementation.  Simply put, if you don’t understand the policy environment, then you may not understand why your public health program, research, or intervention is working or not working, or why it may not be translating to have the desired impact.</p>
<p>Studying policy also allows me to traverse a wide-range of topics and interests in domestic and global health, keeping me both interested and busy at all times.  This includes publishing on subjects including pharmaceutical regulation, eHealth, substance abuse, environmental health, drug safety and quality, innovation and intellectual property, infectious diseases, cancer policy, health and migration, health diplomacy, and health corruption.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where do you see the field of global health moving towards in the 21<sup>st</sup> century?</em></strong></p>
<p>The strength of global health and why it represents a field of study that can address our most pressing global challenges (from the threat of infectious disease outbreaks to the impact of climate change on planetary health) is its multidisciplinary nature.  Global health should be a “safe space” where all types of stakeholders and disciplines can come together to address complex problems from their own unique perspectives but sharing the same goal of advancing human health and development.</p>
<p>A unifying governance framework that can bring us together towards advancing global health are the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many of which are cross-cutting and encourage partnership among different sectors of global society.  For this reason, the journal welcomes submissions that assess key component of the SDGs (including measuring progress to SDG goals, assessing appropriate indicators, and thinking creatively about how the SDGs are a global instrument that can effectuate positive and sustainable change).</p>
<p>Technology can also serve as an agnostic and unifying structure that can address health problems that are borderless.  This includes the emergence of eHealth as its own distinct field of study.  Hence, we would encourage submissions that look at new digital tools, solutions, methods, and interventions that can improve population health.  The potential to leverage eHealth to advance global health are virtually endless, though these technologies need to think about public health as a priority not a secondary outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we welcome submissions and research addressing global health challenges in low and low-middle-income countries.  As a global academic community, we need more visibility to the acute challenges of communities who stand to benefit the most from the promotion of global health.</p>

            Airline travel during the holidays is one big headache. But for some people, “airplane headache” is a truly painful experience. The headache occurs during take-off and landing, is unique to plane travel, and is not associated with other conditions. The pain is severe, with a jabbing or stabbing quality, and located on one side of the head (usually around the eye sockets or forehead).

<p>Many of our relationships begin with that moment when our eyes meet and we realise the other person is looking right at us. Pause for a second and consider the intensity of the situation, the near-magical state of two brains simultaneously processing one another, each aware of being, at that very instant, the centre of the other’s mental world. Psychologists have made some surprising discoveries about the way that mutual gaze, or the lack of it, affects us mentally and physically and how we relate to each other. Here we digest the fascinating psychology of eye contact, from tiny babies’ sensitivity to gaze to the hallucination-inducing effects of prolonged eye-staring.</p>
<p><span id="more-14240"></span></p>
<p>Our sensitivity to eye contact begins incredibly early. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11293433_Eye_contact_detection_in_humans_from_birth">Infants of just two days of age prefer looking at faces that gaze back at them</a>. Similarly, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/16208">recordings of the brain activity of four-month-olds</a> show that they process gazing faces more deeply than faces that are looking away; and at 7-months, infants’ brains process eye contact differently from averted gaze even when the eyes are shown for just 50ms – far too quick for any kind of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Most children recognise the social significance of eye contact, but they seem to take it too far. At the age of three and four, for instance, they often believe that so long as they cover their eyes – thus preventing eye contact – that they will be completely hidden from view. In fact, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/23/why-do-children-hide-by-covering-their-eyes/">children will often claim to be hidden even if they simply avert their gaze while another person looks at them</a>.</p>
<p>Children with autism often show a noticeable lack of eye contact and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1995.tb00687.x/abstract">part of the reason</a> is their difficulty understanding the social significance of another person’s gaze, and that they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414711">find it difficult to infer other people’s mental state from their eyes</a>.</p>
<p>As adults, locking eyes with another person <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/26/eye-contact-makes-us-more-aware-of-our-own-bodies/">immediately triggers in us a state of increased self-consciousness</a>. Researchers showed this by asking participants to rate their own emotional reactions to various positive and negative images, some of which were preceded by a face staring straight at them, others by a face with gaze averted. Participants had more insight into their own emotional reactions (which were measured objectively through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity">galvanic skin response</a>) after they’d made eye contact with a face. “Our results support the view that human adults’ bodily awareness becomes more acute when they are subjected to another’s gaze,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In fact, eye contact is such an intense experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/18/why-its-hard-to-talk-and-make-eye-contact-at-the-same-time/">it even seems to consume extra brain power</a>, making it difficult to perform other challenging mental tasks at the same time. This year a pair of Japanese researchers tested participants on a verb generation task while at the same time they looked at a realistic on-screen face that was either making eye contact with them or had its gaze averted. Making eye contact impaired the participants’ performance on the hardest version of the verb generation task, presumably because it consumed spare brain power that might otherwise have been available to support performance on the verbal task.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who mostly know instinctively to break eye contact to help concentrate on what they’re saying, children will tend to maintain gaze even when asked a difficult question. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/01/05/helping-children-by-teaching-them-to-look-away/">Developmental psychologists have shown that children can benefit from being trained to avert their gaze to help them think things through more clearly</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not other people make eye contact with us changes the way that we think about them and their feelings. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615320">we are more likely to remember faces with which we’ve experienced mutual gaze</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755215">we consider displays of anger and joy to be more intense when shown by a person making eye contact</a>. In fact, when a person or human-like entity (such as a human face morphed with a doll) makes eye contact with us, <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/42/12/1666.full">we assume that he/she/it has a more sophisticated mind</a> and a greater ability to act in the world, such as to show self-control and act morally, and a greater desire for social contact.</p>
<p>Indeed, such is the importance of eye contact to socialising that we tend to form rather low opinions of people who persistently avoid our gaze, assuming that they are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-34932-001">less sincere</a> and, at least if they’re female, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886996001481">less conscientious</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643789">we’re more likely to believe statements made by a person who looks us in the eye</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.psychopathicwritings.com/2011/06/truth-or-myth-psychopathic-stare-part-5.html">maintaining eye contact with <em>too much</em> intensity is seen as a feature of psychopaths</a>.</p>
<p>To try to identity the optimum length of unbroken eye contact to make, psychologists recruited participants at London’s Science Museum and asked them to rate how comfortable they found different lengths of eye contact made by faces shown in video clips, ranging from between 100ms (a tenth of a second) to 10,300ms (just over ten seconds). <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/07/psychologists-have-identified-the-length-of-eye-contact-that-people-find-most-comfortable/">On average, the participants were most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to deciding whether we trust another person, it turns out that it’s not only a question of how much eye contact they make, but also what we see in their eyes. Remarkably, <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.full">it seems that we pay attention at a subconscious level to the behaviour of their pupils</a>, and if they dilate – a sign of attraction and emotional arousal – we judge them to be more trustworthy, whereas if they constrict – a sign of fear or feeling threatened – then we judge them less trustworthy. Also, when we trust a partner with dilating pupils, our own pupils tend to mimic theirs and show similar dilation.</p>
<p>We think poorly of conversation partners who consistently avoid eye contact, but it is our feelings of belonging that are hurt when a stranger looks our way and deliberately avoids meeting our eyes – an experience captured by the German expression “wie Luft behandeln”, which means to be looked at as though air. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/13/0956797611427921.full">Psychologists demonstrated this in a field study on their university campus</a>, in which they subjected passersby to the “wie Luft behandeln” experience after which they reported feeling disconnected from others.</p>
<p>Thankfully we seem to have an inbuilt defence mechanism to avoid these feelings of disconnection when we’re already feeling rejected. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/">Psychologists showed us this</a> by prompting some participants to feel ostracised in a game of online ball passing, and then asking them to judge whether a series of faces were looking right at them or not. Compared with control participants, those feeling ostracised were more likely to believe that other faces were making eye contact with them, even if in truth their eyes were slightly averted.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems extreme eye contact can lead to some very strange psychological effects. If you and a partner look into each other’s eyes for 10 minutes while sitting in a dimly lit room, you are likely to experience odd sensations that resemble mild “dissociation” – a psychological term for when people lose their normal connection with reality. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">When the Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo tested these effects for a paper published in 2015</a>, he found that participants experienced odd feelings of time slowing down, sounds seeming quiet or loud, and 90 per cent said they’d seen some deformed facial features, 75 per cent said they’d seen a monster, 50 per cent said they saw aspects of their own face in their partner’s face, and 15 per cent said they’d seen a relative’s face.</p>
<p>The meeting of minds and souls that occurs through eye contact can be a wonderful thing, but is perhaps best practised in moderation, or at least in full daylight!</p>

            <p>Body mass index (BMI) has been linked to inflammation, and systemic inflammation has been linked to decreased cognition. Now, a new study directly links a high BMI to lower cognitive functioning. The current study, published in the journal <em>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</em>, is the first step in identifying a biologically plausible mechanism for the connection between BMI and cognition.    </p>
<p>The authors evaluated 2 cohorts of people aged 50 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging. One group contained 9000 people and the other contained approximately 12,500.</p>
<p>When the authors correlated BMI, inflammatory markers, and cognition over a 6-year period, the results in both groups were the same: higher BMI was associated with greater cognitive decline. </p>
<p>Specifically, the higher the BMI at the beginning of the study, the greater increase in levels of inflammatory markers (specifically, C-reactive protein [CRP]) over the next 4 years. The change in CRP predicted greater decline in memory and executive functioning over the following 2 years (a total of 6 years from the start of the study.) Established literature already links inflammation to cognitive decline, but these findings take it a step further by highlighting the role of BMI in systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Physical activity and body mass are related to cognitive function in adults. BMI is a function of body mass (i.e., weight) and height, and most data reveal an inverse relationship between physical activity and BMI. Likewise, regular exercise has been shown to prevent cognitive decline in adults who are middle aged and older. </p>
<p>The relationship between physical activity and BMI, however, is nuanced because BMI does not account for a person’s amounts of body fat or muscle mass, both of which can skew the calculation. Still, the general trends are intuitive: engage in more physical activity, decrease body weight, lower BMI, and improve cognition.</p>
<p>In the current study, BMI, by way of inflammation, predicted cognitive decline. While no absolute criteria are reported for preventing cognitive decline, the authors provide one more reason – if one is even needed – to maintain an appropriate body weight and levels of physical activity. Changes in cognition related to aging often take years – even decades – to appear, so a healthy BMI at younger ages may prevent cognitive changes years later.</p>
<p>A recent landmark study indicated that healthy lifestyle habits were cumulative in their protective effects against cognitive decline, asserting that exercise and maintaining health body weight were important for 20 years before the onset of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Healthy BMI is correlated to decreased risks of many diseases and conditions that affect most of the major body’s major organ systems. Now, simply reducing BMI may be a simple, low-cost intervention to decrease the burden of cognitive impairment.</p>

            Is it the job of peer reviewers to detect scientific fraud?



I've been pondering this question for a while but lately my interest was sparked by the case of a retracted cancer biology paper in the high-profile journal Nature Cell Biology. Written by Taiwanese researchers Shih-Ting Cha et al., the article was published on the 15th August and retracted just three months later, after anonymous posters on PubPeer noticed several anomalies in the results.

For instance, there was image duplic

            <p>Keeping up with research publications is always a challenge for researchers. There's simply too much going on. Most of us have a daily or maybe hebdomadal slot where we go over various journals and news. We use things like e-mail alerts, RSS feeds, and that sort of thing. I have a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/feedlists">rather long list of RSS feeds</a> set up in the excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://lzone.de/liferea/">Liferea</a> reader myself.</p>
<p>Now, the one problem with using a desktop application is that it must be set up on every machine that you use - even on your phone. This isn't ideal, really. It is also not ideal that we all end up having our own private lists. So, I thought it'd be nicer if I could set something up on the web that we could all access from everywhere without needing an app. The simple choice was to use <a class="reference external" href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">venus</a> to set up <em>planet</em> instances.</p>
<p>Those that have been around the free and open source community will already know what planets are. They're web pages that aggregate feeds from various sources - usually community members' blogs. There are quite a few around and I follow a few myself -  <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Planet Fedora</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.mozilla.org/">Planet Mozilla</a>, for example. They're extremely useful to keep onesself up to date with the happenings in the communities.</p>
<p>So, I've gone ahead and set up two new planet instances to aggregate information from a myriad of neuroscience sources. The first is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/">Planet neuroscience</a>. The feeds this one aggregates are all from peer reviewed journals. So, pure research on this one. It's one long list of new publications.</p>
<p>The second one is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/">Planet neuroscientists</a>. On this one, I collect posts from various neuroscience news sites and blogs. Quite a few of these sources help make neuroscience more accessible by summarising concepts and results. They also discuss more general topics such as the research method, collaboration, open access, and the sort. So, these are also quite useful to read.</p>
<p>I hope that these two planet instances will help us keep up to date with neuroscience research with less effort than before. They're both hosted on Github and are therefore, public pages. I don't reckon there'd be any bandwidth issues either. They're just static pages. Please do give them a go to see if you find them useful and of course, please spread the word too.</p>
<p>At the moment, I have a cron job that updates them once daily, and I've put up some initial source that I was already following. If you know of any other sources that are worth following too, please do get in touch with me. The themes are extremely simple. You can always open pull requests if you'd like to make them better.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and do drop me a line if you find these new planets useful!</p>

<p>Imagine it: you’re happily surfing through your social media feeds – or what we nowadays call your filter bubble – when some unexpected perspectives somehow manage to penetrate. After you “like” the latest critique of police power, for instance, you come across an article arguing that cracking down on crime can benefit minority neighborhoods. Or, elbowing its way into a crowd of articles celebrating trickle-down economics, you encounter a study showing higher taxes boost growth. What happens next? In <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X16300455">new research</a> in <em>Contemporary Educational Psychology</em>, Gregory Trevors and his colleagues looked at how reading conflicting information can push our emotional buttons, and lead us either towards resistance or a chance to learn.</p>
<p><span id="more-14222"></span></p>
<p>Nearly three hundred students from various Canadian and American universities first indicated their “epistemic beliefs” – that is, their beliefs about how knowledge comes about, such as whether facts are eternal or open to question. Next they read a series of texts on climate change, ordered in a way to maximize dissonance. To begin, an article emphasised anthropogenic change due to human-produced climate gases. To follow, an article emphasised how climate change has been greatly shaped by astronomical causes beyond our control. This “natural cycles” take was then upended by an article on catastrophic consequences of the current climate trend, and then one final switcheroo – a description of how rising temperatures will produce some global opportunities.</p>
<p>After each article, the participants indicated how strongly they felt emotions like frustration, confusion or surprise. At the end, each participant had to synthesise what they had got out of the texts by writing a short summary, which was analysed by text-matching algorithms and human judges to see when participants were prepared to integrate controversial texts, and when they preferred to stick to a simple narrative.</p>
<p>Different beliefs about knowledge led to different emotional reactions, and to different ways of handling the text. For example, for readers who said they believed you can’t verify knowledge based on gut feelings, but need to contrast and compare across many sources, the jarring text on astronomical causes of climate change led to greater feelings of surprise and curiosity. In turn, these feelings appeared to motivate them to take in this new information as shown by the way their summaries acknowledged multiple viewpoints.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the participants who endorsed the idea that knowledge comes to us as food does to baby birds, offered by an authority figure for our easy digestion, felt confused when faced with the prospect of multiple authorities. Confusion makes it harder to take in and remember information, and this appeared to take place here, as these participants’ summaries turned out to be more monotone and lacked reference to the controversial information.</p>
<p>Not every belief turned out to have the expected effect – in particular, believing that knowledge is certain, led participants to experience less surprise, not more, when confronted with contradictions. The researchers speculated that perhaps these participants simply hadn’t engaged with the text enough to take in its implications.</p>
<p>Although we shouldn’t allow our models of the world to be battered around by every spurious claim, the intelligent approach is to acknowledge credibly sourced evidenced-based arguments – especially those that dissent from the dominant narrative. This research shows us how this process can be obstructed by how we feel, and suggests two solutions for educators and influencers. The first is to anticipate the likely reactions to <em>this specific argument</em>: consider where and how your audience might be disengaging due to their emotional feelings and shape your message to redress this. The second is to try to <em>shift how people actually think about</em> <em>knowledge itself,</em> by referencing the robust evidence underlying your claims, linking to counter-evidence and explicitly weighing different sources. You won’t always win minds on the specific argument, but you might open minds, to the benefit of all the conversations to come.</p>

            <p>There are certainly different types of drunks. “Sober Dave is boring, you should hang out with Drunk Dave, he’s wild!” or “She is usually a sweetheart, but watch out, she’s a mean drunk”.  Having documented the transition to our drunk alter-egos for 100s of years, we are no strangers to the concept of drunk personality types. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that alcohol can change our personalities from a sober type to a drunk type.    </p>
<p>Today, research pioneered by University of Missouri graduate student, Rachel Winograd, supports the existence of at least 4 categories of drunk personalities. Importantly, she reveals if one’s type of drunk personality puts them at greater risk of alcohol-related harms (e.g. regrettable sexual encounters or drunken injuries), as well as alcohol addiction. </p>
<p>187 pairs of undergraduate drinking buddies answered questions linking their drunk personality to the “big five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). Cluster analysis of these answers led to the description of four main drunk personality types as outlined below. </p>
<p>Not only is it a bit of fun to ask, “What kind of drunk are you?”, the drunk personality research field holds promise for the development of novel interventions to help problem drinkers.</p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type 1: The Ernest Hemingway</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Ernest Hemmingway" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/ernest-hemmingway-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>As Ernest Hemingway wrote, he ‘‘can drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk.” Thankfully, this is the most common drunk personality type shared by 42% of the undergrads, who reported behaving roughly the same and only slightly changing when intoxicated.  </p>
<p>Compared to the other personality types, the personality factors that tend to change the most when drunk — i.e. conscientiousness (being prepared, organized, prompt) and intellect ( understanding abstract ideas, being imaginative) — do not change drastically.  It is no surprise then that this drunk personality type was not linked with experiencing more negative consequences or alcoholism symptoms. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type 2: The Mr Hyde</strong><strong> </strong></p><strong>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mr Hyde" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/Mr-Hyde-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second most common drunk personality type (23% of the sample) is the monster of a drunk named after the twisted alter-ego of Dr. Jeckyll, Mr. Hyde. They are characterized by being less conscientious, less intellectual and less agreeable than their sober selves or other drunk personality types.</p>
<p>Their drunk personality being the perfect recipe for increased hostility when under the influence, they are statistically more likely to have alcohol use disorder symptoms (i.e. have a higher risk of alcohol addiction). They also suffer a whole range of negative consequences from drinking, from blacking out to being arrested for drunken behaviour. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type  3: The Nutty Professor</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Nutty Professor" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/nutty-professor-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>This type of drunk, comprising 20% of the study participants, does a personality 360 when they get drunk. They are particularly quiet and introverted when sober, but their drunken persona has a large increase in extraversion and decrease in conscientiousness (compared to the other drunk types and their sober self). This is likened to the the Disney character, Shermen Clump, when he transforms from taking his secret chemical formula in <em>The Nutty Professor</em>.</p>
<p>Despite having the most drastic personality change, Nutty Professors were not associated with experiencing more negative alcohol-related consequences from drinking. </p>

<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mary Poppins" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-poppins-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>The least common drunk personality type in the study, found in 15% of the participants, was ‘The Mary Poppins. They are not only particularly agreeable (i.e. embodying traits of friendliness)when sober, they are also agreeable and friendly when drunk. Like Hemmingways, they also decrease less than average in conscientiousness and intellect when getting drunk. </p>
<p>Their drunken sweetness sets them apart from less agreeable Hemmingways. They are essentially the opposite of the Mr Hyde drunk type of drunk, resulting in significantly less negative consequences from getting drunk. </p>

<p>Television programs portraying ordinary people in unexpected situations are almost as old as the medium of television itself. First aired in 1984, <em>Candid Camera</em> is often seen as a prototype of the reality show. Its premise was simple – unsuspecting people were confronted with unusual, funny situations and filmed with hidden cameras. However, the genre exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and 2000s with the global success of such series as <em>Survivor</em>, <em>Idol</em>, and <em>Big Brother</em>, and to this day many people continue to abandon their own activities for the voyeuristic other.</p>
<p>Reality shows have not only amassed incredible popularity but have also become an object of severe, wide-ranging criticism. Among the most serious complaints is the allegation that the shows rely on viewers’ enjoyment of the humiliation and degradation of participants. It is quite difficult to find an individual who is indifferent to such programmes. We either hate reality shows or we watch them, quite often without considering why.</p>
<p>Up until now, scholarly opinion on the subject has been divided. Some maintain that the shows’ appeal constitutes an extension of fictional drama, and is thus driven by positive feelings like empathy and compassion. Others claim that reality TV viewers are driven by a voyeuristic desire to intrude on others and to see them in their most private and embarrassing moments. Michal Hershman Shitrit and Jonathan Cohen from University of Haifa in Israel recently tested these contrasting perspectives for a <a href="http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105/a000186">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Media Psychology</em>.<span id="more-14195"></span></p>
<p>They surveyed 183 participants about 12 different reality shows including local versions of well-known productions such as <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>American Idol</em>, <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em>, <em>Master Chef</em>, and <em>Super Nanny</em>. Participants stated how often they watched each show, how much they enjoyed the shows, the extent to which they would want to participate if offered a chance, how happy they would be if a family member was interested in participating, etc. Among the most important questions were ones involving self-disclosure (items asked to what extent one would reveal to a stranger various types of information, such as “Your personal habits” or “Things you have done and feel guilty about.”), as the researchers hypothesized that self-disclosure would be positively correlated with one’s own willingness to participate in reality shows.</p>
<p>The idea behind the questions about loved ones participating was to measure attitudes towards participation at a slight distance, independent from the respondents’ own personality traits and willingness to participate. Shitrit and Cohen assumed that if people do not wish to be humiliated or see their loved ones publicly humiliated, and at the same time they enjoy reality shows for the humiliation involved, one would expect a negative correlation between enjoyment and willingness to participate. If, on the other hand, empathy is the main reason why people enjoy these shows, the correlation should be positive.</p>
<p>Overall, interest in participating in reality shows was not very high, but crucially, the more that participants said they enjoyed the shows, the more likely they were to say that they’d like to participate, or for a loved one to participate. Unsurprisingly, participants who scored highly in the self-disclosure measure also tended to be more interested in participating in reality shows. On the whole, approval for family members’ participation in reality shows was higher than the desire for self-participation.</p>
<p>Shitrit and Cohen concluded that this tricky and innovative test of the real reasons behind enjoyment of reality shows allowed them to discover that humiliation is not the central motivation, which must rather be empathy.</p>
<p>Are these findings good news for all those who enjoy reality shows and for those who would like to perceive human creatures as good and positive? I would not be so eager to shout the good news to the whole world. Humans are quite complex creatures. Not only do we love others, but quite often we do not like some of them, and at times even hate them. I wonder what results would be generated by a study in which we asked participants not about their loved ones, but rather those they despised? Isn’t it true that we are overly optimistic not only about ourselves but also about our loved ones, and we can’t imagine that we or they would find themselves in embarrassing situations? Conversely, isn’t it the case that we would like to see our enemies embarrass themselves, and we can easily imagine this occurring? In which case, surely it’s possible that we enjoy reality shows in part because of feeling empathy and sympathy when watching participants we like, while at the same time finding enjoyment in seeing those we do not like in their most humiliating and embarrassing moments?</p>
<p>I think that before we trumpet to the whole world the researchers’ “good news” interpretation of their study, it would be desirable to get answers to these questions first.</p>

            <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.med.uio.no/klinmed/english/people/aca/tuomomm/">Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen</a> joins us for a special journal club session this week.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The recent progress in electrophysiological and optical methods for neuronal recordings provides vast amounts of high-resolution data. In parallel, the development of computer technology has allowed simulating ever larger neuronal circuits. A challenge in taking advantage of these developments is the construction of single-cell and network models in a way that faithfully reproduces neuronal biophysics with subcellular level of details while keeping the simulation costs at an acceptable level. In this talk, I will present our work on a stepwise method for fitting a neuron model to data with fine spatial resolution, such as that achievable with voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and Ca2+ imaging.</p>
<p>We applied our method to simulated data from layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) and constructed a model with reduced neuronal morphology. We connected the reduced-morphology neurons into a network and validated against simulated data from a high-resolution L5PC network model. The reduced-morphology neuron model obtained using our approach reliably reproduced the membrane potential dynamics across the dendrites as predicted by the full-morphology model, and was more than 20 times faster to simulate. The network models produced using our method are cost-efficient and predict that interconnected L5PCs, largely due to the medium afterhyperpolarization mediated by the Ca2+-activated SK current, are able to amplify delta-range oscillatory inputs across a large range of network sizes and topologies.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="signature-giphy-2" class=" size-full wp-image-14186 alignleft" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/signature-giphy-2.gif?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>When you sign your name, do you like to fill the available space with bold strokes or is your personal scribble a more modest mark?  A group of psychologists from Uruguay, the Netherlands and Curaçao say that the answer could be a sign of your personality – from analysing the traits and signatures of 192 women and 148 men (psych students in Uruguay), they found that men and women with bigger signatures tended to score higher on “social dominance” – measured by agreement with statements like “I certainly have self confidence” and “I am not shy with strangers”. Among women only, a bigger signature also correlated with narcissism – agreement with claims like “I am a special person” and “I am going to be a great person”. Signature size was not correlated with self esteem or aggressive dominance, which is more about controlling other people for self-serving reasons.</p>
<p>If true, these <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616301362">results</a>, published recently in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, would appear to provide some support for the quack field of graphology – the idea that our handwriting style reveals our personality (listed as one of the 50 great myths of psychology in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Myths-Popular-Psychology…">the book</a> by Scott Lilienfeld and his colleagues, based in part on <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-07238-011">a decisive meta-analysis of the area</a> published by Geoffrey Dean in 2002). But the authors of the new research are careful to argue that it is signatures specifically, not handwriting more generally, that may be revealing of personality, precisely because they are such a personal form of self expression.<span id="more-14120"></span></p>
<p>Sceptics may take some convincing, but consider that previous findings have also suggested signatures have a special psychological significance, including <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15197.full">a study</a> that showed people are more honest in a document when they sign it at the beginning rather than the end, presumably because their signature activates attention to their sense of self.</p>
<p>The new findings also add to other research linking signature styles with personality, including <a href="http://prx.sagepub.com/content/62/1/152.abstract">a paper from 1988</a> that found women who embellished their signatures with lines and exclamation points scored higher on narcissism, and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144419">another from 2014</a> that found CEOs with bigger signatures tended to receive higher salaries, but their companies performed worse. There’s even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4708124">research</a> that showed boosting people’s self-esteem, by giving them inflated feedback on an IQ test, led them to produce a larger signature.</p>
<p>Alvaro Mailhos and his colleagues say their study is an advance on the existing literature because they used three different measures of signature size – essentially based on the area of the smallest possible rectangle than can be placed around the scribble, either on a horizontal or at an angle, or based on the space filled by a curved outline drawn round the scribble.</p>
<p>They also controlled for complicating factors such as the size and number of individual characters in the person’s name, and signature style such as signing with one’s initials or a simple stylistic flourish. Importantly, they also showed that only signature size and not the size of one’s printed name was linked with social bravado and narcissism, likely because printing your name is less personal and expressive.</p>
<p>The correlations between signature size and social dominance and narcissism (in women) were modest in size (the beta coefficients in a regression were 0.12 and 014, respectively) but given they held across the different measures of size and after controlling for confounds, the researchers suggested their findings are robust and meaningful.</p>
<p>“We unambiguously demonstrate a link between personality traits and signature size, and also, in so doing, we offer a robust methodological approach to study the relationship between handwritten gestures and psychological traits that could be of value for further research,” they concluded.</p>

<p>Experiments suggest that telling if two unfamiliar faces are the same or different is no easy task. Such research has sometimes presented participants with full body shots, has more commonly used cropped shots of people’s heads, but almost never placed the faces in a formal context, such as on a photographic ID card. But these are the situations in which face-to-photo matching is most relevant, when a shop assistant squints at a driver’s license before selling alcohol to a twitchy youth, or an emigration official scrutinises passports before their holders pass ports. Moreover, it’s plausible that the task is harder when juggling extra information, something already found in the realm of fingerprint matching, where <a href="http://https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/14/fingerprint-matching-is-biased-by-the-assessors-prejudices/">biographical information can lead to more erroneous matches</a> because it triggers observer prejudices. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new article</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> confirms these fears, suggesting that our real-world capacity to spot fakes in their natural setting is even worse than imagined.</p>
<p><span id="more-14097"></span></p>
<p>Jennifer McCaffery and Mike Burton at the University of York asked 80 adult participants to make judgments on pairs of face photographs, deciding when the two shots were of the same person or two different individuals. In some instances, one of the two faces was embedded in a passport image (see below), and in these cases the participant was also asked to keep an eye out for data errors in the passport, which were sprinkled through a minority of instances. McCaffery and Burton found that when matching against a passport-embedded photo, participants showed a bias towards thinking the two faces were of the same person, a bias which led them to miss more instances where the photos didn’t match; in a real situation, this translates to letting someone through control on another person’s passport.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_14102" style="width: 464px;"><img alt="screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35" class=" size-full wp-image-14102 aligncenter" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35.png?w=845" />Sample stimuli from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">McCaffery and Burton, 2016</a>.</figure>
<p>In another experiment, the researchers investigated how the task of face-matching affects the way we evaluate passport data and vice versa. As well as making face judgments, participants had to look out for errors in the passport, such as: the gender of the name not matching the gender of the supposed passport owner; the wrong year of birth, which could be off by 20 years (this should be an easy task, as people can typically judge age from a photograph to within five years); and an error in the place of birth, which was indicated by spelling mistakes in well-known British place names, such as “Luuton”. The participants’ error-spotting performance was compared against control participants recruited in earlier research who were challenged to look for errors without also having to perform face-matching.</p>
<p>Combining face-matching and data-matching into one situation harmed performance in both areas. Once again, faces in a passport context were more likely to be falsely waved through as a match than when the comparison was between headshots alone. And participants were poorer at spotting the data errors, compared to control participants, only catching one in five of the place of birth and year of birth errors, versus well over half caught by control participants. What’s more, participants were worse at spotting data errors when the faces were a true match, suggesting the confidence from this task leaked over to the other and made them less vigilant.</p>
<p>It’s well-known that tasks with multiple demands are harder, loading on things for our mind to deal with and allowing the possibility of interference between the two tasks. So the findings are understandable, but still troubling. Perhaps the procedure behind identity checks needs tuning by breaking it into discrete steps – perhaps even undertaken by different individuals. Moreover, this work is an important reminder that even well-established findings can be wide of the mark of how things truly operate, when based on laboratory research that doesn’t take account of real-world conditions.</p>

<li>You’re on your way to the traditional Thanksgiving family get-together. You drive down a familiar street, locate your familiar house, and park in a familiar spot.<br />
<em>Thank you, hippocampus, for dutifully encoding Wisteria Drive, the light-blue-colored Colonial house and the parking spot next to the creepy oak tree almost twenty-eight years ago. I owe you one.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Wait a minute. <em>Whose new convertible is that on our driveway?</em><br />
<em>Hippocampus, remind me to find out.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You step out of your car and notice that the neighbors still have their Halloween pumpkins on display. Ew! They look hideous.<br />
<em>Well, at least I can decipher a ‘face’ in those god-awful, shriveled carvings. Thanks, fusiform gyrus.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You quickly snap a picture, and send it to your roommate, along with, of course, the face-with-tears-of-joy emoji.<br />
<em>Thanks, again, dear fusiform gyrus, to help comprehend the world of two hundred and seventy nine emojis. You’ve revolutionized the way we text.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You stare at the magnificent spread on the dining table. But tonight, you resolve to eat in moderation. No matter how delicious the food is, as an evolved human, you have the ability to suppress an urge.<br />
<em>Thank you, prefrontal cortex, for being my sleek, determined executive controller. Your strong-willed decisions have saved my many embarrassments, especially around free food.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you open the door, you catch a whiff of blissful aroma from the kitchen. Ah! You smell pumpkin pie.<br />
<em>Wow, olfactory receptor neurons, you went from transducing smells to the olfactory bulb to making my stomach growl in no time! Thanks. Now I really have to eat.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ovoid, curvaceous gravy boat sits proudly next to the turkey, fulfilling its sole responsibility on Thanksgiving Day. You’ve always cracked up at its odd shape.<br />
<em>Hey, visual cortex, thanks to your ventral pathway for helping make sense of shapes. They sure ask “what” a lot, but I know they mean well.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your pants feel tighter as you eat, but you continue gorging the smooth, creamy mashed potatoes. <em>I can’t stop! This is so good!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations. You’ve fallen for the moves of the neural seductress, the ventral tegmental area. She has the (electrical) potential to make you feel so loved, so rewarded, and so addicted.<em> <em>Thank you, thank you, and I don’t care!</em></em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex shakes his head in utter disappointment.</p>
<p>Psst! Cerebral gossip: Ever since you made a New Year’s resolution to lose weight earlier this year, the steadfast prefrontal cortex has been in a complicated relationship with the ravenous ventral tegmental area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amid the clatter of forks and plates, your aunt interrupts your intimate moment with the pumpkin pie with, “Say, when are you going to graduate and get a “real” job?”<br />
<em>Whaaa, where did this come from?</em> Your vigilant amygdala senses potential fear, and nudges the hypothalamus to sort out a fight or flight response. Your eyes widen. Your heart is beating faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let’s face it. You’re too stuffed for a fight. You’re too stuffed for a flight.</p>
<p>The amygdala makes a note: <em>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision. Do not fear unsolicited questions about career. Especially when eating dessert.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>[In reviewer voice] You missed being thankful for the brain stem.<br />
<em>Wait, really? Why should I?</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Because no one messes with the Mr. Brain Stem. We’re all just happy to have the support, and always cite him.<br />
<em>You sure have the nerve to randomly name-drop Mr. Bigwig Brain Stem.</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Yes, (cranial) nerves III – IX, to be specific.</p>
<p>Your corrected manuscript now reads: <em>I’m extremely thankful for the brain stem.</em></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It’s 10:30 PM. You try to keep your eyes open, but the idea of snuggling into your bed seems rather appealing. Oh, the sweet relief of melatonin. Yawn.<br />
<em>Thanks, suprachiasmatic nucleus. Nighty-night.</em></li>

            <p><em><img alt="Female head and refresh icon" class=" size-medium wp-image-14084 alignleft" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/thinkstockphotos-468413800-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>In the ongoing, complex debates about the extent and meaning of psychological differences between the sexes, mental rotation ability is usually quoted as one of the most robust examples of where a difference can be found. This is the ability to rotate objects in your mind’s eye, and while there is a lot of overlap between men’s and women’s performance, there is plenty of evidence that men, on average, are better at this than women. Can we take this to reflect a genuine, specific difference in average cognitive ability between the sexes?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. A new, small <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-015-0704-7">study</a> in <em>Psychological Research</em> reminds us why this field of science is so difficult to interpret. The findings suggest that the mental rotation ability of women who habitually suppress the public display of their emotions is equal to that of men. In other words, sex differences in mental rotation ability may reflect an emotional difference between the sexes – emotional suppression is known to be more common in men than women – rather than a cognitive difference.<span id="more-14012"></span></p>
<p>Anne-Katharina Faltung and Markus Kiefer asked 28 men and 28 women to fill out some surveys about their emotional lives, including their proneness to angry outbursts and their tendency to suppress public displays of emotion (one example item was “I keep my emotions to myself”).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_14091" style="width: 167px;"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19" class=" size-medium wp-image-14091 alignright" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19.png?w=157&amp;h=300" width="157" /><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701">Shepard &amp; Meltzer, 1971</a>.</figure>
<p>Then the participants completed 48 trials of a classic mental rotation task, which involved judging within four-seconds per trial whether or not a three-dimensional shape on the left of the computer screen was the same as the one on the right, just rotated to a different orientation. The trials got harder as the task went on, and emoji-type symbols and spoken feedback (such as “Oh dear, you made a mistake”) informed the participants whether they’d got each trial right or not.</p>
<p>Overall, the men outperformed the women in terms of making fewer total errors, and in being less likely to follow up one error with another. The researchers were particularly interested in these follow-on errors because they are a sign of the participant reacting badly to negative feedback, either through being distracted or giving up.</p>
<p>But then Faltung and Kiefer split up their male and female groups according to emotional suppression habits. Overall men reported suppressing their emotions more than women, but there was enough variation among the women to create two subgroups – one group who said they mostly let their emotions out, and another group who said they more often suppressed their emotions.</p>
<p>Women who did not habitually suppress their emotions made more total errors on the task than men (both high and low emotional suppressors) and more follow-on errors, but crucially, women who habitually suppressed their emotions performed as well as the men on the rotation task, in terms of total errors and follow-on errors (there was still a tendency for higher performance among men, but the difference in their scores and those of the emotion-suppressing women was not statistically significant).</p>
<p>We must beware over-interpreting such as small study, but the researchers say their results demonstrate an important principle, namely that investigations into potential cognitive differences between the sexes need to take sex differences in emotional strategy into account. Mental rotation ability – often heralded as one of the most robust examples of a sex-linked cognitive difference – may be more about emotions than about visuospatial ability.</p>
<p>This need for nuance in the field of sex-differences research is in addition to other findings that have highlighted the way that cultural pressures can influence sex differences in cognitive performance. For example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/01/womens-true-maths-skills-unlocked-by-pretending-to-be-someone-else/">it’s been shown</a> that women perform as well as men on maths when competing under an alias, presumably because this removes the pressure not to conform to sex-related prejudices about ability.</p>
<p>Another angle to these new findings concerns emotional regulation strategies. It’s a mistake to think that the male tendency for emotional suppression is inherently superior.  In fact emotional suppression is usually considered unhelpful, especially over the longer term, because it’s linked with increased risk of stress and depression. But these findings suggest that in the short term, and in certain contexts, it may be advantageous by helping to avoid the distracting effect of negative feedback.</p>

But, new research says that the opposite is true. There is something common in the childhood of homosexual men that makes them a target for pedophilia and sexual abuse — gender non-conformity. </p>
<p>Many homophobic religious institutions make unfounded claims about same-sex sexual child abuse causing homosexuality, like those coming from the pro-heterosexual, anti-gay activist group, Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME):</p>
<blockquote><p>We can see that sexual abuse can theoretically account for every case of homosexuality…</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the lens of science these claims are considered ridiculous and laughable at best, often followed by outrageous and scientifically unfounded claims that being gay is the cause of pedophilia.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, non-heterosexuals with a history of same-sex sexual abuse as a child often ask if this made them desire the same-sex as an adult. Similarly, gay men and women who were sexually abused by the opposite sex as a child, ask if this caused a sexual fear and revulsion towards the opposite sex that ‘made’ them gay. </p>
<p>Whether the pedophile or child molester was gay or straight, gay victims tend to ask the same question at some point, “Did sexual abuse make me gay?”</p>
<p>Research indicates that this isn’t true of straight people abused as children, they are less likely to question if being abused made them straight. Thus it is often argued that it is the culturally ingrained negative views of gay people, particularly of gay men, or simply belonging to a minority group, that the question is even asked in the first place. </p>
<p>Even so, it is still a common view that sexual abuse can ‘turn’ a child gay despite no convincing or reliable evidence that premature sexual activity or child sexual abuse grossly changes sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The main withstanding argument in support of this view is that child sexual abuse is more common in the gay community than the straight community. In fact, meta-analysis indicates that sexual minority school children were on average almost 4 times more likely to experience sexual abuse than heterosexual children. </p>
<p>The latest research stands against this argument, providing the most convincing causal evidence yet that it is a common aspect of many gay men’s childhoods that is linked with higher rates of sexual abuse in boys who later identify as gay in adulthood — not sexual abuse ‘making’ a child gay. </p>
<p>Published in <em>Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment</em> the new research suggests that a child’s gender nonconformity, which is more common for non-heterosexuals, that may make them more desirable targets for pedophiles and child abusers.</p>
<p>To clarify, gender nonconformity you may also know as gender bending. Gender nonconformity is when people identify with or behave like what is culturally considered typical for the opposite sex, going against the gender grain if you will. For example, boys that like to play dress-up, or girls that prefer rough play. </p>
<p>In the study, 1753 participants filled out an online survey that regarding their sexual orientation, history of child abuse, and the degree of gender nonconformity they recall from childhood, including the activities and kinds of play and types of clothes they liked.</p>
<p>Although other research has suggested a link between gender nonconforming and sexual abuse in children, whether nonconforming caused abuse, or abuse caused nonconforming had not previously been assessed this directly. By using a special type of analysis called instrumental variable analysis, the new study was able to estimate causal relationships. It is therefore study able to more confidently address the complex question “Can sexual abuse make you gay?”</p>
<p>In line with other research, gay participants (being male or female homo and bisexuals) in the new study had greater odds (~45% greater) of being sexually abused in childhood than heterosexual participants. </p>
<p>They also found that heterosexual and non-heterosexual men who are more gender nonconforming (i.e. ‘feminine’) in childhood had higher chances of abuse than sexual orientation matched boys who are more gender conforming (i.e. ‘masculine’). In other words being gay or not had nothing to do with it. It was whether boys behaved like stereotypical boys or not that was key. </p>
<p>However, gender non-conforming girls were not at higher risk of sexual abuse than conforming girls in the present study. It is research supported factoid that gender nonconformity in girls, like being a ‘tomboy’, is generally more socially accepted, approved of and tolerated in Western cultures than gender nonconforming in boys, who are often considered as mama’s boys, sissies or brats.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that gender nonconforming boys are less generally approved of partly due to cultural femi-negativity. Cultural femi-negativity being where femininity is particularly devalued when it does not adhere to gender norms. The idea that abusers target children with feminine qualities as to make for more compliant and less socially valued abuse targets fits well with the study and the body of research as a whole considering more girls are targets of pedophilia and child molestation than boys, and that more gender non-conforming feminine boys are targeted more than masculine conforming ones, whether they are gay or not.  </p>
<p>This also makes sense when considering research suggesting that most abusive pedophiles are generally aroused by youth, and that the child’s sex, at the core of their desires, is pretty immaterial. Whether they abuse mainly boys or girls, it’s about a child being a child, ease of access to that child and avoiding getting caught through ease of controlling the child.</p>
<p>Whereas adult child molesters, who can be a pedophiles (i.e. someone specifically attracted to children) but are not necessarily pedophiles, get a sexual kick out of domination, power and control, marking those with more feminine qualities as being easier and less risky targets. </p>
<p>Importantly, the research suggests that it is having feminine personality traits and behaviors more common to gay boys, i.e. gender nonconforming, that leads to such high rates of child abuse cases in gay men. There is no credible research as of yet that indicates that it is common that child sexual abuse is a cause of being gay. </p>
<p>It seems that there is something, or somethings, about gender-non-conforming in boys that puts them at an increased risk of sexual abuse. If research now focuses on exploring further what those somethings are we can better protect children from the traumas of sexual abuse.</p>

It's well known that our pupil size varies over time due to changes in both emotional state and cognitive 'effort'. As Tsukahara et al. put it
Starting in the 1960s it became apparent to psychologists that the size of the pupil is related to more than just the amount of light enterin

The cutting edge of this research was presented at the nanosymposium on <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/424" target="_blank">Molecular and Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></strong> Saturday afternoon. From genetics to brain structure to molecular markers, this session highlighted the diversity of tools researchers are employing to better understand the neural effects of both normal and pathological aging.</p>
<p><strong>Structural Biomarkers</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease pathology is known to originate in the brain’s medial temporal lobe – most notably in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus – before spreading to more extensive cortical regions. Although prior research has therefore focused largely on structural changes in this region, new evidence shared at SfN this year suggests that aberrant brain structure <em>beyond the medial temporal lobe</em> may serve as an additionally powerful disease biomarker.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?taylor" target="_blank">Taylor Schmidt</a></strong> from the University of Cambridge presented findings that basal forebrain gray matter atrophy precedes atrophy in the entorhinal cortex, in cognitively impaired and healthy older adults with high amyloid burden, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Not only did basal forebrain atrophy predict delayed recall performance, but this effect was mediated by amyloid levels. Could subcortical atrophy, perhaps driven by amyloid deposition, precede cortical degeneration to serve as an earlier biomarker of Alzheimer’s pathology?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~nikolai/arash_ahamohammadi_sereshki.html" target="_blank">Arash Sereshki</a></strong> of the University of Alberta expanded upon these findings, encouraging researchers to look beyond the hippocampus for signatures of brain aging. Using high-resolution MRI, his work showed that volume of the amygdala, a region involved in fear and reward learning among other functions, was a strong predictor of age-related neural changes. The basal nucleus of the amygdala showed the most robust atrophy with age, but this association only occurred in men.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/owen-phillips" target="_blank">Owen Philips</a></strong> from Stanford University explored the effects of Alzheimer’s disease on white matter, delving beyond the thick, deep fibers that characterize the brain’s celebrated connective superhighway. Instead of examining the white matter of the cingulum, corpus callosum or fornix, his group evaluated whether superficial white matter – which myelinates later and is more complex than deep white matter – is affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Using vertex-wise analysis, they found widespread increased diffusivity in the superficial white matter of Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to healthy controls, most prominently in the temporal lobe. This diffusion signal negatively correlated with global cognitive function, indicating that greater superficial white matter diffusion was a good indicator of the severity of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><strong>Genetics</strong></p>
<p>Various factors integratively determine the type and extent of neuropathology that one may sustain in older age, and which may ultimately lead to the neurodegenerative changes discussed by Schmidt, Sereshki and Phillips. Although genetics only play one part in this pathological cascade, the APOE and BDNF genes are well-documented contributors to risk for cognitive impairment in older age.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-sweeney-67a2b01b" target="_blank">Melanie Sweeney</a></strong> of the University of Southern California examined effects of the APOE4 allele, which increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease, on neurovascular health. Her group reported that breakdown of the blood brain barrier, which selectively filters substances into the brain from the blood, is greater in individuals with APOE4 than those without the risk gene. APOE4 carriers also demonstrated increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, even at preclinical stages (i.e., before any disease symptoms), beginning first in the hippocampus, one of the earliest sites to undergo neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~nikolai/nikolai_malykhin.html" target="_blank">Nikolai Malykhin</a></strong>, also from the University of Alberta, looked more closely as how genetics affect morphometry in subregions of the hippocampus. In cognitively normal adults, volumes of all hippocampal subregions were greater for those carrying the APOE2 variant, which lowers risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Volume of the dentate gyrus – but no other hippocampal subregions – was reduced for BDNF met-carriers, showing that BDNF effects on hippocampal size were more specific than APOE effects.</p>
<p><strong>Molecular biomarkers</strong></p>
<p>Although amyloid and tau are the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, they have been remarkably challenging to detect in the living human brain. However, thanks to impressive methodological advances, there has been a recent surge in the development of tools to visualize the most sensitive molecular disease biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N13-1271" target="_blank">Xiaotian Fang</a></strong> from Uppsala University presented a novel imaging technique that uses an antibody that, fused with a blood brain barrier-passage molecule, can enter the brain and bind to amyloid protofibrils, suspected to be the toxic component of amyloid plaques. This tracer effectively labeled amyloid protofibrils in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and holds promise as a more sensitive imaging tool than current amyloid plaque tracers.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maja_Mustapic" target="_blank">Maja Mustapic</a></strong> of the NIA explored the potential of extracellular vesicles in the blood – which can transport molecules such as amyloid or tau to the brain – as Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. Levels of phosphorylated tau in these vesicles distinguished Alzheimer’s disease patients from normal controls with high accuracy, both at disease onset and before symptoms were manifest. Analysis of other vesicular molecules is underway.</p>
<p>As exemplified by the diverse techniques presented in this session, a multimodal approach may be our best bet for the most accurate early detection of neuropathological events. I’m already eagerly awaiting #SfN17 for updates on the ongoing advances in the development of Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers over the coming year.</p>

<p>When someone’s talking to you, have you noticed how they seem to keep breaking off eye contact, as if finding it hard to both talk and look you in the eye at the same time? Similarly, when you’re explaining something to someone or telling them a story, do you find yourself looking away from their eyes, so that you can concentrate on what you’re saying? A pair of Japanese researchers say that this happens because eye contact has a “unique effect” on our “cognitive control processes”. Essentially, mutual gaze is so mentally stimulating that it can be tricky to think straight and maintain eye contact at the same time.</p>
<p><span id="more-13922"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211385">Past</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/000712608X371762/abstract">research</a> has shown that eye contact interferes with other mental tasks such as those involving visual imagination. Arguably this isn’t so surprising because both eye contact and visual imagination are obviously tapping the same mental domain. In their <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716302360">new paper</a> in <em>Cognition</em>, Shogo Kajimura and Michio Nomura tested whether eye contact also interferes with our ability to generate verbs in a word task, and whether this happens in all cases, or only when the verb generation task is made extra difficult.</p>
<p>Twenty-six participants were asked to look directly at a stranger’s face shown on-screen, while simultaneously performing an auditory verb generation task. Six men’s and women’s faces featured in the study, and were shown either looking straight at the participant or with their gaze averted. The faces were video animated so they appeared naturally, blinking and breathing. Each trial, the participant looked at the face, heard a noun, then their task was to respond out loud with a verb that could be used with the noun in a sentence.</p>
<p>The researchers used a range of nouns that are easier or harder to respond to, based on how strongly associated to the noun any related verbs are (i.e. retrieval demands high or low); and whether one possible response is much more dominant than any others versus there being many equally plausible alternatives (i.e. selection demands high or low).</p>
<p>To take one example, the noun “milk” is easy on both measures, because it’s strongly associated with “drink” and much more so than any other verb.</p>
<p>The key result is that participants were much slower at the verb generation task when making eye contact with the face on-screen, as opposed to when the face’s gaze was averted, but only in the most difficult version of the verb generation task, when retrieval and selection demands were high.</p>
<p>Kajimura and Nomura said this shows that eye contact doesn’t directly interfere with mental processes specifically related to verb generation – if it did, then performance times ought to have been longer for eye contact across easy and difficult versions of the verb task. Instead, they said the results are consistent with the idea that eye contact drains our more general cognitive resources – the kind that we need to draw on when some other task, such as speaking, becomes too difficult to be handled by domain-specific resources. That’s why the more complicated the story you’re telling (or excuse you’re making), the more likely you are to need to break off eye contact.</p>

<p>Places of work have become fairer thanks to their embrace of meritocracy: the idea that the best person for the job is the right person for the job. Formal assessment processes, for example, help ensure that interviews are granted on merit, rather than allocating them based on which resumes remind the hiring manager of a younger version of themselves. One consequence of meritocracy is the replacement of seniority-based promotion – you get a better position when “it’s your time” – with one based on ability, a development that means younger people with the appropriate skills can leapfrog older colleagues and end up managing them. Unfortunately, according to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.2129/abstract">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em>, this can have nasty repercussions.</p>
<p><span id="more-13894"></span></p>
<p>Florian Kunze and Jochen Menges surveyed employees at 61 German companies, based primarily in the service industry, but also finance, manufacturing, and trade. Nearly 8000 participants described their age difference in relation to their managers, and a subset reported their experience of various negative emotions over the last six months. Managers tended to be older than those they managed, but on average a quarter of relationships did involve younger managers. Crucially, in companies where the size of the age gap was larger between younger managers and older subordinates, employees tended to report more negative emotions, such as anger or fear, experienced over the last six months.</p>
<p>Why would this be? Consider how the older subordinates might feel. We tend to measure our life progress by using our peers as a benchmark, particularly those in our age cohort, who may provoke a flush of envy if they rise far past us. But more brutal yet is when those who should be <em>behind</em> us pull ahead, rubbing our faces in our own inability to keep pace. And when such a person is managing you, it’s hard to avoid this.</p>
<p>More broadly, being under the supervision of someone younger than us is a simple status incongruence, like being lectured on your dress sense by your precocious 8-year-old nephew. This is an engine for resentment-based negative emotions. Such emotions, Kunze and Menges suggest, can then reverberate through the wider organisation, especially – and as established by diversity research – because employees will typically pay more attention to what happens to colleagues who tend to stand out, or in this case, to relationships that deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>Kunze and Menges also asked the leadership of each company to report their recent financial performance, as well as measures of productivity and efficiency. After controlling for company size and efficiency, they found that companies experiencing more negative emotions showed worse performance on all counts. More youthful managers of older subordinates, therefore, contribute to worse company performance through the negative emotions their existence encourages, presumably through sapping morale and enthusiasm for collective effort in the face of so much frustration.</p>
<p>The data revealed a buffer against this harmful outcome, but it’s a bitter pill to ask anyone to swallow: when employees reported that suppressing their emotions was the norm in their organisation, age differentials didn’t lead to more negative emotions in the wider organisation. The researchers reasoned that when emotions are unexpressed, there is no signal to the rest of the workforce that something is up, so they can go about their days in blissful ignorance. But this isn’t to solve the problem, but to distil it into a smaller but more concentrated form, as long-term emotion suppression <a href="http://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12212647">can lead to</a> depression, damaged health, and impaired cognitive performance, a cruel fate to which to consign these older workers.</p>
<p>But companies shouldn’t “revert to the old workplace with traditional age structures”, say Kunze and Menges, because their research says nothing about the overall benefits of merit-based promotion. However, they do believe the negative repercussions that they’ve revealed should be addressed. One suggestion is to help older subordinates make sense of their feelings and explore whether they can come to terms with them rather than simply suppress them. Another suggestion, which I warmly advocate, is to address the root causes, changing the culture around “career time tables” and addressing issues of hierarchy and voice, so that old-timers, whether managers or not, can share their accrued wisdom and fully participate in the organisations to which they have given for so long.</p>

<p>Besides problems with social interactions, it has been known for a while that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940314">many people with autism experience sensory difficulties, such as hypersensitivity to sounds, light or touch</a>. With sensory impairment now officially included in diagnostic manuals, researchers have been trying to see if there’s a link between the sensory and social symptoms. Such a link would make intuitive sense: For instance, it is easy to imagine that if someone experienced sensory stimuli more strongly, they would shun social interaction due to their complexity. More specifically, you would expect them to struggle with filtering out and making sense of social cues against the backdrop of sensory overload.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175094671400230X">Past research</a> has suggested that tactile hyper-responsiveness in particular may be relevant. The correct processing of tactile information plays an important role in differentiating yourself from others (so-called “self-other discrimination”), a crucial requirement for social cognition. In fact, touch may be unique among the senses because there is a clear difference in the tactile feedback received when you touch something compared to when you see someone else touch something. Now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613781">a study</a> in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em> has used recordings of participants’ brain waves to provide more evidence that tactile sensations are processed differently in people with autism and that this may contribute to their social difficulties.</p>
<p><span id="more-13857"></span></p>
<p>The researchers from Ghent recruited 19 men and women diagnosed with high functioning autism and 17 neurotypical control participants matched for gender, intelligence and age – both groups had an average age of around 32 years. While everyone filled out questionnaires assessing everyday problems with sensory processing, participants with autism received an additional questionnaire on the severity of their autism symptoms</p>
<p>To deliver tactile sensations, two electrodes were placed on the participants’ index and middle fingers of their right hand, which was covered with a dark cloth. Before the experiment began, 30 tactile stimulations (mild electric currents) were delivered to both fingers to familiarise participants with the device.</p>
<p>The actual experiment was relatively straightforward and involved the researchers recording the participants’ brain waves with EEG throughout. Each trial began with a picture displaying either a human or a wooden hand in a non-flexed position, resembling the position of the participants’ hidden right hand. Next, a picture was shown of either a tapping index or middle finger, which was accompanied by a single stimulator “tap” sent to the electrode on either the participant’s index or middle finger. This way, the tactile feedback the participants experienced was either congruent with the observed action (e.g. they saw a tapping index finger and received stimulation to their index finger) or incongruent (e.g. they saw a tapping index finger but received stimulation to their middle finger).</p>
<p>The researchers were especially interested in spikes of brain activity that are known to be relevant to processing tactile sensations, including the so-called N100 (a negative spike that occurs 100ms after the sensation) and a later positive spike (the P3) that has been linked with self-other discrimination in various contexts. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761757">previous studies</a> found an amplified P3 signal when participants heard their own name compared to another name or saw their own face compared to someone else’s. Crucially, this congruency effect <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152577">is also seen</a> when observed movements match experienced tactile sensations.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesised that if social impairment is related to sensory processing, then the participants with autism would show a reduced congruency effect in P3, and the size of this irregularity would be negatively correlated with their social functioning. And this is exactly what they found.</p>
<p>Compared to controls, participants in the autism group demonstrated differences in their brain waves both at earlier stages of sensory processing (the N100) as well as later stages. In line with the hypothesis, congruent trials (tactile feedback compatible with the observed action of a human hand) led to amplified P3 signals in the controls, but not in the autistic group. Furthermore, in the participants with autism, the greater their sensory and social impairments, the smaller the amplitude of the P3 component of their brain waves in response to congruent pictures.</p>
<p>These findings allow for two suggestions: First, individuals with autism struggle to differentiate between themselves and others (based on purely tactile information), which is similar to what other studies have found. Second, this difficulty was more pronounced in those individuals who also showed a higher degree of social and sensory impairment, suggesting these two domains are linked.</p>
<p>So does this mean that sensory hypersensitivity causes the social deficits that individuals with autism face? While this study cannot establish which is caused by which (or if they are both caused by a completely different factor), it does provide experimental evidence of a link between the two. To what extent this knowledge will improve treatment options for patients with autism remains to be studied by future investigations.</p>

What makes this study so interesting is that it was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and so was able, at least in theory, to determine whether quitting Facebook actually causes changes in well-being. Previously, there has been lots of research reporting correlations between social network use and happiness, but correlation isn't causation.

This year’s theme, “Creating the Healthiest Nation: Ensuring the Right to Health,” brought to the forefront a diverse range of public health issues, including the Zika epidemic, suicide and prescription drug overdose which gained particular attention this year<em>.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Public health approach to suicide prevention</strong></p>
<p>Opening session speakers included Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper who <span class="st"> discussed sexual and reproductive health care, legal marijuana, drug abuse and suicide, which is one of the major challenges facing Colorado considering that it has the seventh highest suicide rate in the nation.<br />

<p>Alex Crosby, the Branch Chief of the Surveillance Branch of the Division of Violence Prevention in the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, gave an intriguing talk about the CDC’s unique role in suicide prevention. To address the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, the CDC looks at promoting individual, family and community connectedness in order to prevent suicidal behavior. It has also helped produce a common language to facilitate identifying and monitoring such behavior.</p>
<p>A new CDC report has shown that overall suicide rates in middle aged men aged 45-64 has increased by 43 percent in the last 15 years compared to overall suicide rates which rose 24 percent. There doesn’t seem to be one cause that can explain this spike but there is likely a convergence of multiple factors within middle aged men that makes them especially vulnerable. The CDC have made it a priority to fund programs looking into suicide behavior in this group further.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stigma and taboo surrounding suicide means that funding is affected. Jarrod Hindman, Director of the Suicide Prevention Center in Denver, explained that, in the last 10 years, federal funding has been invested in research on leading causes of death such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, and prostate cancer. Major progress has led to decreased mortality rates and so it’s time the same is done with suicide where death rates are on the rise.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription drug overdose</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8174" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="The number of pain relievers prescribed in the US has skyrocketed" class="size-medium wp-image-8174" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/drugs-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The number of pain relievers prescribed in the US has skyrocketed</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: frankieleon
</div></figure>
<p>In his opening speech, Governor John Hickenlooper also discussed drug abuse and proudly announced that Colorado had expanded access to naloxone, which reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, noting that he learned how to administer the medicine and carries a dose of it in his state trooper’s vehicle in case he encounters someone in need.</p>
<p>Availability of prescribed drugs, which is the second most abused type of drug in adolescents following marijuana, can be an important determinant of suicidal behavior. Opioids, CNS depressants for anxiety and sleep disorders and stimulants often prescribed for ADHD are the classes most commonly abused. An astonishing 2.4 million Americans have used prescription drugs non medically for the first time within the last year and an estimated 52 million people have used these drugs for non medical reasons at least once in their lifetime. Mian Hossein, a Professor at Morgan State University, discussed the mental health consequences of nonmedical prescription drug use among youths aged 12-17 in the United States. His research, which uses data from 176,200 youths over a period of 10 years documents a relationship between the use of nonmedical prescription drugs and major depressive episodes in this group.</p>

<p>As concerns about the spread of the Zika virus continue to grow, APHA is one of 11 national organizations funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support and disseminate evidence based approaches for preventing and controlling the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>A special session organized at the conference discussed staging a multisectoral and epidemiological approach to the emergent threat of the virus. Lyle Petersen, Director of the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), spoke about the virus’ presence in the United States. He explained that, as there was no previous experience with the virus in the western hemisphere, diseases such as Dengue Fever and Chikungunya had to be looked at to give an idea of how the virus might spread.</p>
<p>Zika prevention strategies currently include vector control, warnings against travel for pregnant women, blood donor screening and providing access to contraceptives. However, there is still a lot which is not known regarding other possible modes of transmission, what the duration and magnitude of risk is in sexual transmission of the virus as well as what the preconception risk is.</p>
<p><strong>APHA 2017</strong></p>
<p>We left APHA this year with an encouraging message from Governor John Hickenlooper to the thousands of public health practitioners attending this year: <strong>“You guys are gonna save the world.” </strong></p>
<p>We can’t wait to attend next year’s conference in Atlanta where ongoing efforts will be recognized and shared with the goal of achieving healthier communities and health equity globally.</p>

<p>Social power may be an abstract concept, but it has serious, concrete consequences. Certainly for our ancestors, and also for many people today, the ability to identify who is in charge might literally be considered a survival skill, as the boss is often the person controlling the distribution of food and other resources.</p>
<p>It’s already known that even infants expect smaller characters to give way to larger ones – in effect, social power based on physical dominance. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12643/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new paper</a> in <em>Child Development</em> has explored the related question of when and how young children are able to discern social power from more subtle social dynamics between two parties, finding that already by age three children can interpret various forms of social power – resource control, goal achievement, and permission giving – to identify who’s in charge. The setting of social norms (such as what clothing ought to be worn) is recognised as a sign of social power at age 5-6, while perhaps surprisingly, actually giving orders was not recognised as marking social power until age 7–9. <span id="more-13731"></span></p>
<p>Selin Gülgöz and Susan Gelman recruited most of the participating children at a science museum, and they tested them via illustrated vignettes that featured two characters, of equal size and shape, one exerting a form of social power over the other. It was made clear that these characters were the same age as each other, and that they were the same gender as the participant (to control for any assumptions about the social power attached to age and gender); and the characters’ names were chosen to be similar to each other and to convey little meaning. After listening to each story, the children (tested individually) were simply asked to say in each case which character was in charge, and to explain their reasons.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of one of the vignettes, in this case involving “goal achievement”, which 3-year-old’s recognised as a mark of social power, in this case correctly identifying Flip as the boss:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flip and Blip wanted to get dessert. Flip wanted to get ice cream, while Blip wanted to get candy. They could only go to one place. Flip and Blip went to the ice cream store and got ice cream.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s a vignette depicting the setting of social norms by one character over the other (in this case Dizz is the boss), which was identified as a form of social power at age 5-6:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dizz was telling Fizz and their friends that red is the best color and that from now on everyone should wear red. The next day, Fizz came to school wearing a red t-shirt, just like the one Dizz had been wearing. Fizz told Dizz, ‘Look at my red t-shirt.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, a vignette featuring the giving of orders, not recognised as social power until age 7-9:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rafyy and Zaffy were playing with blocks. Raffy was telling Zaffy what to build. Raffy told Zaffy to build a house, and Zaffy built a house.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall the results from this first study showed that the ability to identity social power begins extremely early in life – at least as early as three years of age – but that it also matures through childhood, taking in new manifestations.</p>
<p>The researchers explained that “giving orders” and “norm setting” may take longer to recognise as expressions of social power because they require an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic">deontic logic</a> – abstract rules of obligations and permissions – in contrast to goal attainment and resource allocation, which are more concrete expressions of power. The fact that three-year-olds recognised “permission giving” as social power seems to defy this explanation, but the researchers explained that their vignettes may have confounded permission with resource allocation by describing one character giving permission in relation to toys or other resources.</p>
<p>A feature of all the vignettes used in the first study was that social power was used to some extent malevolently, with the powerful person exercising control over their subordinate. In a follow-up study, the researchers tested whether young children also understand social power when used benevolently, for example with one character choosing to give up their own goal to allow the other character to reach theirs. The results showed that children could also recognise benevolent social power, although they found it more difficult than recognising malevolent power (testing of adults on the same vignettes showed that they too found it easier to recognise instances of malevolent power).</p>
<p>Gülgöz and Gelman concluded that “children have an early-emerging and complex understanding of social power across various possible manifestations”. They noted that the children they tested were from middle class backgrounds, and that it would be interesting to see whether and how children’s early life experiences, and the culture in which they are raised, affects the way they identify and process different expressions of social power.</p>

            <p>This year marked the <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/">47<sup>th</sup> Union World Conference on Lung Health</a>, held in Liverpool, UK, and <a href="http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em></a> was lucky enough to attend.</p>
<p>The annual conference, run by the <a href="http://www.theunion.org/">International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</a> (The Union), includes many aspects of lung health; however the main focus is tuberculosis (TB) research, with this year’s theme being ‘Confronting Resistance: Fundamentals to Innovations’.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8163" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Barry Skeates/Flickr" class="wp-image-8163 size-medium" height="156" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/liverpool-300x156.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Barry Skeates/Flickr</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Given the release of the <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/">World Health Organization’s 2016 Global Tuberculosis Report</a> which showed a sizable increase in deaths due to tuberculosis (due to improved reporting of cases) it is clear that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve the <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_strategy/en/">End TB goals</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of the specific scientific sessions there was a huge effort towards engaging both the patient and local communities. Alongside the <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/programme/community-common">Community Common</a>, which was open to the public, local charities and organizations relevant to the scope of the conference had prominent space to discuss their work and speakers such as <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/updates/plenary-three-social-protection-for-a-more-holistic-approach-to-ending-tb">Amy McConville</a>, a TB survivor,  ensured that the human side to the diseases was not forgotten.</p>
<p>Given the theme of the conference it was not surprising that multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), was a major focus. As well as many insightful talks on new drugs and diagnostics there was also acknowledgment that we could be doing better with the tools we already have. In addition ways to reduce transmission were discussed, such as the use of UV disinfection in a talk by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/edward-nardell/">Edward Nardell</a>, and the upcoming <a href="http://www.impaactnetwork.org/studies/IMPAACT2003B.asp">PHOENIx trial</a> highlighted by <a href="http://www.auruminstitute.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=57:prof-gavin-churchyard&amp;Itemid=126">Gavin Churchyard</a> for investigating reducing household transmission (the primary cause of MDR-TB in children).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8167" style="width: 274px;"><img alt="WHO/http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/en/" class=" wp-image-8167" height="171" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/TB-300x194.jpg" width="264" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">WHO/http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/en/</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It is clear that in order to reduce TB deaths by 95% and to cut new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035 a huge amount more needs to be done. However we left Liverpool with confidence everything possible will be done by the attendees to meet these targets.</p>

Exercise is extremely important during space travel because prolonged weightlessness decreases muscle strength, bone density, and cardiovascular functioning. Motivation and adherence to high intensity exercise, coupled with a socially isolating environment with atypical access to social support, may be compromised. Exercising with a partner can help with motivation, but that is not possible for astronauts where space and exercise equipment is limited. Even using earth-based virtual partners is impractical due to reduced communication and scheduling, especially the further one goes into deep space.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="feltz_gameshot_5375" class="wp-image-8152 size-medium alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Feltz_gameshot_5375-300x200.jpg" title="D Feltz CC" width="300" />
<p>Our research grant from the National Space Biomedical Research Institute of NASA is exploring the best ways to keep astronauts motivated to exercise when they go on long-duration space flights by using an exercise-video game (exergame) with a software-generated partner–one that is anthropomorphic but clearly artificial and synthetic. Our software-generated partner incorporates group-dynamics principles (behaviors and psychological processes occurring within, or between, social groups), such as upward social comparison and indispensability to group achievement, to address lack of motivation for vigorous physical exercise (i.e., the level of effort).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, we can’t conduct our research with astronauts themselves at this stage, so have recruited men and women, ages 35 to 62 (the average age of an astronaut is 48), who were as physically healthy as astronauts, to test our exergame and software-generated partner.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="interval-track-male" class="wp-image-8154 size-medium alignleft" height="168" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Interval-Track-Male-300x168.png" title="D Feltz CC" width="300" />
<p>We are using an exergame that involves a stationary bike, where individuals exercise on a variety of bike trails with or without a software-generated partner, under high-intensity interval training conditions. The partner is programmed to be slightly superior to the exerciser (upward social comparison) and to be a teammate, where the team score (exercise effort) is based on the weaker partner, thus creating a sense of value and indispensability (not letting the partner down) for the exerciser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been testing various features of the game and different versions of the partner to see what works best to keep participating exercisers motivated to give their best efforts while exercising at vigorous intensities 6 days per week over a 6-month time period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While this research is important for astronauts, it also has practical applications for those of us who remain earth-bound. Interpersonal and social concerns (for comparing favorably with others or for not letting a partner down) have the potential to add powerful sources of motivation to exercise. These sources of motivation could open up a set of new tools in exergame design for fitness, especially for those with social physique anxiety, those who lack the time and/or resources to join an exercise group, and those in exercise rehabilitation therapies. None of the existing exercise games currently on the market incorporate the critical design features suggested by contemporary social psychological research, particularly research on motivation gains in task groups (namely immediate feedback on performance of one or more other players, the ability to control the discrepancy in abilities of players, and most importantly, the indispensability of individual player effort for determining group outcomes). Thus, our research has the potential for earth-based commercial applications to build more engaging and enjoyable exercise video games for various populations.</p>

            <p>Reducing bit error rate and improving performance of modern coherent optical communication system is a significant issue. As the distance travelled by the information signal increases, bit error rate will degrade. Support Vector Machines are the most up to date machine learning method for error correction in optical transmission systems. Wavelet transform has been a popular method to signals processing. In this study, the properties of most used Haar and Daubechies wavelets are implemented for signals correction. Our results show that the bit error rate can be improved by using classification based on wavelet transforms (WT) and support vector machine (SVM).</p>

<p>When planning my SfN itinerary, the amazing <a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071" target="_blank">meeting planner</a> helped me identify plenty of sessions and presentations that sound really interesting. Here, I’d like to share some of my favorites with you. If you, like me, are interested in psychiatry, neuroimaging, developmental disorders, adolescent development, or early stress and adversity, the following presentations may be worth attending:</p>
<p><em>388.05. <strong>Rewarded approach of threatening spiders engages areas of the mesolimbic dopamine system</strong> (F. Ahs) Monday 2-2.15pm @SDCC2</em></p>
<p>Professionally, I’d love to learn more about dopaminergic modulation of fear; personally, however, I’m terribly afraid of spiders, to put it mildly. My ambivalence is probably very similar to what the brave arachnophobic volunteers in Ahs’ study felt while in the MRI scanner, as they were invited to view spider pictures for money. To be totally honest: at the moment of writing, I haven’t yet decided whether I’ll go see the spider presentation or not. Follow my blog over the next few days to see which was stronger: fear or curiosity.</p>
<p><em>662. <strong>The social brain in human adolescence</strong> (S-J. Blakemore). Wednesday 11.30am-12.40pm @SDCC Ballroom 20</em></p>
<p>It’s intriguing how children inevitably grow up, change, struggle, learn, adapt, experiment, get confused and then refocus. The majority of mental illnesses surface before the age of 24, with adolescence as a major high-risk period. I’m looking forward to the presentation of professor Blakemore, arguably a leading expert in the field and a great speaker.</p>
<p><em> </em><em>772.06. <strong>Early adversity affects amygdala-cortical functional connectivity: links to adversity and gut microbial community structure</strong>. (B.L. Callaghan) Wednesday 2.15-2.30pm @SDCC5B</em></p>
<p>The brain is pretty cool, but luckily it’s not the only organ we have. The more I learn about neuroscience, the more I realize that all organs should be treated with equal respect. Seeing work such as that of Callaghan et al., I can’t help but think that the current neuroscience craze may simply be another symptom of society’s irrational belief in the rationality of human behaviors. Are we, neuroscientists, guilty of tunnel vision? Or worse, have we been staring at the wrong organ? You’ll definitely find me attending this presentation!</p>
<p><em>PDW13. <strong>How to Present Science Using Visual Tools</strong> (workshop). Monday 9-11am @SDCC30C</em></p>
<p>“A picture is worth a thousand words”. That is, a good picture. A thousand words! Imagine having one thousand <em>extra</em> words for that paper you’ve been trying to shorten in order to meet the journal’s word count, and you’ll understand my excitement about this workshop. In addition, good visuals are very helpful when explaining our findings to audiences that have not read our papers, and are not necessarily planning to do so. Sleek visuals will make you stand out from the crowd. In this workshop on Monday morning, experienced speakers will share their tips, tricks, and tools to create attractive visuals. I’m looking forward to learning about new tools to communicate my science and engage my audience!</p>

<p>In the recent past, there has been a great divide between the sciences and arts. However, recent studies are uncovering the connections between science and art and their importance to healthy and productive lives. It seems the Renaissance women and men were onto something! With the rise of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) as well as art and music therapy, scientists, clinicians, educators, and society are beginning to realize the importance of both disciplines working together to improve health and education. As someone who is both a musician and neuroscientist in training, I am thrilled that both disciplines are gaining national attention and being represented on such a high-level platform such as Society for Neuroscience!</p>
<p>There are two opportunities to learn about and discuss neuroscience and the arts:</p>
<p>On <strong>Sunday, November 13</strong> from 8:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., a symposium titled <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4071/session/111" target="_blank"><em>Neuroscience of Music: Novel Discoveries and Their Implications in the Understanding of Music and the Brain</em></a></strong> will discuss the implications and importance of the neuroscience of music for the discussion of new, thought-provoking ideas. Experts in the areas of neuroscience and music include Dr. John Iversen, Dr. Nina Kraus, Dr. Daniel Levitin, and Dr. Elizabeth Stegemöller, who will speak on topics including music and neuroplasticity, music and neurochemistry, and the biology of auditory learning.</p>
<p>On <strong>Tuesday, November 15</strong> from 3:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M., an advocacy forum open to the public titled <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4071/session/847" target="_blank"><em>Art, Music, and the Brain: How the Arts Influence Us from Youth to Maturity</em></a></strong> will tackle the role and influence of art and science in human creativity, productivity, and health. The panel will consist of neuroscientists, artists, and educators including Dr. Kenneth Elpus, Dr. Ping Ho, Dr. Nina Kraus, Dr. Daniel Levitin, and Dr. Bill Martin.</p>
<p>As Einstein once said: “All religions, arts, and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom” (<em>Out of My Later Years)</em>. So, make your way to each of these sessions to learn from these leading experts about the role of the arts not only in the neurohealth and neuroeducation of society but also in the enrichment of your own life. I hope to see you there!</p>

Among other conditions, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gherig’s disease) and frontotemporal dementia ravage the cognitive and motor functions of their victims. While these diseases have unique genetic or environmental origins, they have one common neuropathological signature: aberrant accumulation of proteins – such as amyloid-β, tau, α-synuclein, huntingtin or SOD1. Because of this commonality, immunotherapy–by targeting the proteins implicated in disease onset and progression–is a promising candidate for treating a host of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wednesday, November 16</strong> at the 2016 Society for Neuroscience conference, Dr. Eliezer Masliah, of the National Institutes of Health, will present the latest research on the use of immunotherapy for various neurodegenerative diseases, in his talk <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/137" target="_blank"><em>Capturing Immune Responses to Understand and Treat Neurodegenerative Disease</em></a></strong>. In this Q&amp;A, Dr Masliah explains the state of immunotherapy for neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: Why do immunotherapies hold more promise for treating neurodegenerative disease than other treatments? How have clinical trials so far supported their efficacy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: The advantage of immunotherapy is that it can work via several mechanisms and can be very specific. Multiple mechanisms of action include blocking propagation, targeting oligomers, modulating immune responses, reducing toxicity, reducing inflammation, stimulating clearance, lysosomal clearance autophagy pathways, etc. Recent anti-amyloid phase III trials show some promise in post-hoc analysis. Synuclein immunotherapy has been shown to be safe and early preliminary studies show promise.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: What are the main challenges that immunotherapies face?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: Most recent studies have shown that new approaches are safer and more specific. Potential challenges are cost in particular with passive immunotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: Do you expect that immunotherapies would be as effective against intracellularly accumulating proteins as against extracellular proteins? For example, would a tau or α-synuclein antibody be as effective as an amyloid-β antibody?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: Yes, there is extensive evidence that antibodies enter cells and target abnormal intracellular proteins; however, it is worth noting that most proteins such as amyloid-β, tau synuclein, are actually secreted and propagate from cell to cell. There are many opportunities and mechanisms for antibodies to target abnormal aggregated proteins. In fact, the more toxic forms might be those secreted.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: There is uncertainty as to whether preventing protein accumulation can stop progression of some neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, some trials that effectively lower amyloid-β levels have failed to show cognitive effects. Are there certain diseases, which we are confident are in fact caused by toxic protein accumulation, that may be better targets for immunotherapy than others?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: The trials you refer to were in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease that for practical purposes represent full blown disease, not good examples. Primary and secondary prevention trials such as A4, DIAN-TU and others are underway in patients with pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment. Results won’t be known for a few more years.</p>

            <p>Brain dynamics emerge from the collective and orchestrated activity of single neurons. The main characteristics of neurons are their morphologically elaborate structures to receive and integrate inputs (i.e., the dendrites) and communicate their signal to other neurons (i.e., the axons). Because dendrites receive, integrate and transform inputs into relevant output they can be considered as the functional workhorses of the brain.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I’ll outline the problematic relation between dendrite structure and function in neurons. Then I’ll show how highly non-trivial processing can take place in neurons due to the spatial extend of dendrites. Lastly, I will present my current work on distilling the essence of dendritic computations using simplified models.</p>

            <p>The prevalence and functional effects of depressive disorder following traumatic brain injury are significant. Now, sertraline may be effective for preventing depressive symptoms after TBI.</p>
<p>A group of researchers at Baylor College of Medicine evaluated 94 patients aged 18 to 85 years who had been hospitalized for mild, moderate, or severe <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/01/traumatic-brain-injury-can-deep-sleep-be-neuroprotective/">traumatic brain injury</a> (TBI). Most of the patients (n=92) were Caucasian and more than half (n=56) were male. The research team randomized the patients to receive either 100 mg daily of sertraline (48 patients) or placebo (46 patients) for 24 weeks or until symptoms of a mood disorder occurred.</p>
<p>Overall, sertraline was effective at preventing the onset of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/06/brooding-buddies-co-complaining-linked-with-depression-and-anxiety/">depressive symptoms</a> compared to placebo. Sertraline was also well tolerated  and adverse effects in both treatment groups were mild. It is unclear how long the effects of sertraline last in this patient group.</p>
<p>The incidence of TBI is rising and it now is a major cause of death and disability. TBI can occur from injury, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/05/shift-work-linked-with-risk-of-severe-stroke/">stroke</a>, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and violence. People suffering moderate to severe TBI are at risk for depression and loss of life roles. Life satisfaction declines in this population, so prevention of depressive symptoms is imperative for maintaining health and function.</p>
<p>Sertraline, an antidepressant, has been used to treat PTSD but its effects in TBI are still being defined. The results of the study, which were published in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, need to be confirmed with larger sample sizes and in multicenter trials. Further, a question remains if combining sertraline with cognitive behavioral interventions will optimize long-term outcomes.</p>

            Do you find gruyère gross? Are you repelled by roquefort?



Neuroscientists are now investigating why this might be. A new paper claims to reveal The Neural Bases of Disgust for Cheese.

French (heh) researchers Jean-Pierre Royet and colleagues used fMRI to scan 15 people who liked cheese and 15 who "hated" it. During the scan, the participants were shown images of cheese and were exposed to cheese odors.

The six neuro-cheeses were blue cheese, cheddar, goat cheese, gruyère, parmesan,

When a species shows a very small census size (e.g. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099941">blue-throated macaws</a>), it is obvious that it is threatened and that urgent conservation measures are needed to preserve it. However, there are stunning examples in which a species can go from billions of individuals to vanishing, within a human lifetime.</p>
<p>Understanding how an abundant species can suddenly disappear is tricky. However, there are certain factors to watch out for. Factors that when combined at the right time and place can cause these “unexpected” extinctions. One paradigmatic example is the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/10636.full">passenger pigeon (<em>Ectopictes migratorious</em>)</a>. The passenger pigeon was an abundant species (2-5 billion individuals) that became extinct in blink of an eye. What caused such a drastic event? Two main identified factors were: that the species was going through the shrinking stage of its naturally oscillating demography and this coincided with a strong hunting pressures imposed by humans.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the passenger pigeon? Are the factors that led to its disappearance generalizable to other taxa? It seems that there are intrinsic factors that make certain species more sensitive to extinction, for example the tendency to undergo drastic <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215004005">demographic oscillations</a>. On the other hand, there are also extrinsic factors, like those imposed by humans (e.g. hunting, environmental degradation).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when comparing the current situation of the European turtle dove with that of the passenger pigeon, there are many similarities that could push the former in the direction of its less fortunate cousin. The European turtle dove is an abundant species (6-10 millions individuals). However its numbers have been decreasing, leading to its classification as vulnerable to extinction (<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22690419/0">IUCN red list</a>). In the United Kingdom alone it has shown a 97% decline in 40 years. The main reasons for this decline are habitat degradation and game hunting. Moreover, our genomic analysis suggests that the species has a naturally fluctuating demographic history, and that it is currently going thorough a shrinking stage…</p>
<p>Is there something we can do to prevent history from repeating itself? We can first learn from recent history, and continue to emphasize the importance of using cutting edge tools (such as genomics and niche modeling techniques) to help understand the population genetic structure and demographic history of species. This kind of research is valuable, not only because it helps understand evolutionary processes, but also because it provides useful information for researchers involved in the creation of international <a href="http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/life-eurosap">cooperation networks</a> for the protection of species and their natural environments. With this kind of research we can transform the unexpected into expected, and that is a very important first step towards conservation.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="http://brainblogger.com">Brain Blogger</a> on November 06, 2016 01:09 PM.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>During the prenatal period, the fetus begins to form one of the most complex structures in nature, the human brain. This process is called neural embryogenesis and it represents one of the most complicated processes in prenatal life. The process relies on the tight regulation of behavior of the cells that will make up the brain. Neuronal stem cells (NSC) play a key role in embryonic brain development.</p>
<p>NSCs need a special environment in order to be able to carry out their function in neural embryogenesis, the creation of new cells to populate the nervous system. However, in some cases, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/04/20/preteens-feel-the-effects-of-moms-pregnancy-bad-habits/">harmful environmental exposure</a> can result in abnormal NSC behavior. Prenatal exposure to lead is one of these harmful influences that may overwhelm the NSCs’ mechanisms of coping with cellular damage. As a result, NSC-regulated processes in neural embryogenesis may become affected, often leading to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>Upon fertilization, from a single cell, a mass of cells is formed and later this mass divides into several layers from which all structures of the human body originate. This is also the case for the central nervous system. It derives from one of the layers that forms the neural tube, the precursor to the brain, brainstem, and the spinal cord. Initially, the neural tube is rather small, but due to the creation of new cells from NSCs it gradually enlarges. Later, the cells in the neural tube get specialized to different functions by changing their cellular and biochemical characteristics. Evidently, if something goes wrong at any of these steps, developmental brain abnormalities may occur.</p>
<p>Lead has been a part of human civilization for a long period of time. However, only recently has the mechanisms by which lead causes negative health effects began to emerge. Lead is particularly harmful to NSCs, even when the exposure is minimal. Very minimal <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/10/06/new-report-on-the-use-of-antidepressants-during-pregnancy/">prenatal exposure</a> to lead has been linked to lower IQ, aggressiveness, and other problems. Research studies have also shown that prenatal exposure to lead produces more harm than exposure during the postnatal period. These findings have been linked to the mechanisms behind cellular injury of NSCs by lead. The proposed mechanisms affect essential cellular functions that result in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in DNA methylation.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/05/could-targeting-mitochondria-be-the-key-to-treating-psychosis/">Reactive oxygen species</a> are molecules that are naturally occurring as a result of cellular respiration. However, during pathologic conditions their levels can increase substantially. Chronic lead intoxication results in the increase of ROS through several mechanisms. Among them, there is a direct effect of lead ions on the proteins that regulate ROS levels. Additionally, lead can increase the level of ROS indirectly through interaction with aminolevulinic acid, a biochemical precursor for the components of hemoglobin. ROS can damage various structures in the cell and while doing this, create even more ROS. Additionally, ROS are involved in cellular death signalling and other cellular responses.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms regulating <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/11/epigenetics-and-its-major-influence-on-life/">gene expression</a>, and the regulation of gene expression is one of the bases of cellular differentiation. It has been shown that exposure to lead results in the alteration of DNA methylation, which in turn is associated with the inhibition of NSCs differentiation. Through mechanisms that are not yet known, lead causes changes in the methylation patterns close to genes strongly associated with neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Cells do not remain passive during these processes. Like other cells, NSCs have mechanism by which they counteract many of these harmful events. One the most recent investigation has studied the process involving the protein Nrf2.</p>
<p>Nrf2 has been directly linked to NSC’s protective mechanism against oxidative stress caused by exposure to lead.  Nrf2 is associated with protein KEAP1 in the cytoplasm. When the levels of ROS increases, Nrf2 separates from the KEAP1, migrates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA regions called antioxidant response elements (AREs). Upon Nrf2 binding, AREs activate expression of its target genes that code for diverse proteins responsible for cellular ROS detoxification.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Nrf2 target, SPP1 protein, has been recently identified. SPP1 has particular significance in the lesion of NSC because it has been associated with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/31/nurturing-the-brain-part-9-blueberries/">neuroprotective properties</a> through <em>in vitro</em> studies and through the association of mutations in its coding gene sequence with neurological diseases. These effects are the result of the signalling mechanism involving an anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative process. The process results in compensatory responses to lead inhibition of NSCs proliferation. As a result, SPP1 has been proposed as a protective mediator of neurotoxicity in lead exposure.</p>
<p>Many diseases result from excessive cellular damage that cells are not able to adapt to. This is the case for NSCs where essential neurodevelopmental processes can be altered by lead toxicity. Although NSCs are equipped with protective mechanisms, they are often not powerful enough to counteract the harmful environmental influences. In such cases, the alterations of neural embryogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation take place.  Specific changes leading to particular neurological manifestations still remain to be investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Our improved understanding of the harmful effect of lead on prenatal neurodevelopment calls for increased attention to avoid the exposure of future mothers to this toxic element. It is believed that millions of pregnant women around the world are regularly exposed to high concentrations of lead in food and drinking water. This often affects the health of the younger generation in many countries around the world.</p>

Gunderman notes the media interest in a recent paper about how brain activity 'adapts' to lying. CNN, for instance, covered the study with the headline: "Lying may be your brain's fault, honestly". Gunderman doesn't like this idea:
There is the suggestion that a behavior such as lying can be explained "mechanistically." Saying so implies the brain is a mechanism that can be account

<h3><strong>Reflections on Open Science at PLOS</strong></h3>
<p>PLOS has proven that making quality research openly available for anyone to read, download and reuse is a viable business model. Our collaborative efforts with like-minded organizations have inspired others – from individual researchers to the larger publishing industry – to move toward a more open ethos. In this environment, Open Access is no longer constrained to free access to research, it’s also about <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/02/10/zika-emergency-puts-open-data-policies-to-the-test/" target="_blank">open data and a more open way of working together</a></strong>. Examples of this at PLOS include our pioneering a <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank">forward-thinking data policy</a></strong> at scale and contributions to the community-developed open-standard <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">taxonomy of contributions</a></strong> – the CRediT Project – that provides specific and comprehensive attribution on research articles for all who participate in generating a published work.</p>
<p>We are proud to be <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/01/author-credit-plos-orcid-update/" target="_blank">Open in Action collaborators</a></strong> with other publishers including The Royal Society, <em>eLife</em>, Science journals and EMBO Press in making a <strong><a href="http://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter" target="_blank">public commitment</a></strong> to implement persistent identifiers such as <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">ORCID iDs</a></strong> by year end. These iDs enable researchers to receive credit for a wide range of research outputs in addition to publications (for example blog posts at PLOS) and we are well on the way to meeting this goal. With <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/" target="_blank">many of these same collaborators</a></strong> (The Royal Society, <em>eLife</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>EMBO Journal,</em> <em>Nature </em>and Professor of Structural Biology Stephen Curry and Associate Professor of Information Science Vincent Larivière) we committed to publish citation distributions of our journals to demonstrate a key flaw with impact factors—they simply do not reflect article citation rates. In publishing this data, PLOS hopes to “strengthen a call for action originally voiced by Stephen Curry, one of the authors, and to encourage other journals to follow suit.” The original <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/05/062109" target="_blank">paper and dataset are posted on bioRxiv</a></strong> for all to access.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Policies and Open Research</strong></h3>
<p>Data sharing and Open Access are a matter of course for PLOS authors, providing open and rapid dissemination of their original research in all areas of science. PLOS supports authors who wish to share early versions of their research manuscripts to receive feedback before – or in parallel to – formal peer review, and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/" target="_blank">encourages researchers to share via preprint servers</a></strong> either before or after submission to a PLOS journal. PLOS has a long-standing policy of accepting manuscripts previously posted to preprint servers, however we have eased the process for authors for this rapid dissemination vehicle that also brings transparency to the review process. Authors can now use bioRxiv’s <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript" target="_blank">direct transfer to journal service drop-down menu</a></strong> to submit directly to PLOS.</p>
<p>We have exemplified Open in Action as the first publisher to react to the Zika outbreak with a Call for Research and <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/zika" target="_blank">The Zika Collection</a></strong>. This placed PLOS on the map for rapid dissemination and discovery of results during the outbreak. As a result, work of authors who published with PLOS caught the attention of legislators: The US Capitol called PLOS to ask for additional information regarding the <strong><a href="http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Currents: Outbreaks</em></a></strong> article, “<strong><a href="http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/travel-volume-to-the-united-states-from-countries-and-u-s-territories-with-local-zika-virus-transmission/" target="_blank">Travel Volume to the United States from Countries and U.S. Territories with Local Zika Virus Transmission</a></strong>” as they were considering this information for use in upcoming legislation.</p>
<p>The practical impact of Open Access and open data may not always be immediate. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (<strong><a href="https://www.iucn.org/" target="_blank">IUCN</a></strong>), publishers of the <strong><a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a></strong>, voted in September 2016 to adopt the <strong><a href="https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/014" target="_blank">Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa</a></strong> (EICAT) for classifying invasive species, work originally <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001850" target="_blank">published in <em>PLOS Biology</em></a></strong> in 2014. Author Tim Blackburn stated “IUCN has approved the motion on our method for classifying alien species impacts…The adopted text requires a consultation before EICAT becomes an IUCN standard… [but] it is an extremely positive development… Getting the paper published somewhere so high profile (and open) really made a difference, so thank you!”</p>
<p>Actionable knowledge on an international scale extends beyond conservation efforts to inform human health and disease initiatives. The <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ferg2015" target="_blank">WHO Estimates of Foodborne Disease Collection</a></strong> reports the first estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) <strong><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/242847" target="_blank">Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group</a></strong> of the incidence, mortality and disease burden caused by 31 foodborne hazards. Outcomes reported in the Collection – from PLOS, WHO and <strong><a href="https://f1000research.com/browse" target="_blank"><em>F1000Research</em></a></strong> authors – can contribute to improvements in food safety throughout the food chain when incorporated into policy development at regional, national and international levels.</p>
<p>If you choose to be Open in Action with PLOS, you can also have a bit of intellectual fun. The <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/" target="_blank">PLOS Paleo Community</a></strong> held a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/2016/09/14/vote-for-the-top-10-open-access-fossil-vertebrates-of-2016/" target="_blank">competition</a></strong> for the paleontology research community for the <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/paleo-top-ten" target="_blank">Top 10 Open Access Fossil Vertebrates</a></strong> of the year, to honor researchers that have thought long and worked hard to provide our community quality research that is openly available to all. Articles represent the vertebrate diversity published in Open Access journals, from <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a></strong> to <strong><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2027/" target="_blank"><em>PeerJ</em></a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1501659.full" target="_blank"><em>Science Advances</em></a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2016/1490-new-marsupial-lion" target="_blank"><em>Paleontologia Electronica</em></a></strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Encouraging the Next Generation of Open</strong></h3>
<p>PLOS supports the growth of <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/" target="_blank">Early Career Researchers</a></strong> (ECRs) as they build skills in science communication, become champions of Open Science and develop into ambassadors of change for a future where all research is freely available, all work is evaluated fairly and all members of the scientific community have opportunity to participate in the dialogue of and about science. To support the efforts of ECRs, we are continuing to offer our Early Career Researcher Travel Award (ECRTA) program, launched in 2015. For its first round in 2016, applicants were asked to describe characteristics of the optimal peer review process and how they might build this in a way that makes science more transparent and research more rapidly available. <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2016/07/16/ecrawards1/" target="_blank">Winners were profiled</a></strong> and we’ve now completed a second award round asking what ECRs consider to be the value of a preprint server and how its broad adoption might benefit the scientific community and society.</p>
<p>As a participant in <strong><a href="http://www.opencon2016.org/" target="_blank">OpenCon 2016</a></strong>, a conference focused on educating and empowering the next generation in the areas of Open Access, Open Education and Open Data, PLOS will have the opportunity to hear directly from participants regarding their desires and concerns for the future of science communication. In a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtiyYK1U-Vs" target="_blank">video welcoming address</a></strong>, Publisher Louise Page acknowledges the inspiration provided by this annual gathering of Open Science thinkers and presents highlights of the past year at PLOS that reflect how the organization is Open in Action.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>“PLOS was founded with the researcher foremost in our minds and we want to work with you to continue our journey from Open Access to Open Data, Open Source and ultimately to Open Science,” says Page.</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief video is an introduction to an <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/hnr7Wsyz3SA" target="_blank">OpenCon Community Webcast with Peter Suber</a></strong>, Director of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication.

<h3><strong>Open Access Is Open in Action</strong></h3>
<p>In an increasingly vibrant research world where multimedia data, new types of research outputs and real-time online discussions are altering the way the community works, communicates and cooperates, Open Access is more than ever Open in Action. PLOS is proud that our <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/core-principles" target="_blank">founding core principles</a></strong> exemplify Open in Action. What makes us notable among other publishers is that we were Open in Action <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/history" target="_blank">from the start</a></strong>: 24/7, 52 weeks a year.</p>
<h3><strong>Our View of Open Science</strong></h3>
<h6>As a leading Open Access publisher, PLOS pursues a publishing strategy that optimizes the openness and integrity of the publication process by aiming to ensure that research outcomes are discoverable, accessible and available for discussion and that science communication is constructive, transparent and verifiable. We strive to implement policies and innovations that promote reproducibility, credit and accountability, as these priorities support establishment of an Open Science culture, with open data, early sharing of work and clear contributor recognition. We see the benefit of Open Access content in relation to future advances in machine-readable formats and text and data mining.</h6>
<p>We look forward to hearing your Open Science stories and the outcomes, large or small, that you have achieved. Leave a comment here or email to <strong><a href="mailto:communications@plos.org">communications@plos.org</a></strong>.</p>

<p>A new <em>BMC Plant Biology</em> article describes a valuable new tool to study plant cell walls and glycobiology. Glycans are carbohydrate molecules that attach to plant cell walls and proteins, and serve critical regulatory functions in development, cell-cell communication and immunity. The inability to directly label and image endogenous plant glycans with fluorescent tags has thus far hindered study of these molecules and their function in cellular processes. However, the copper-free click chemistry approach from Hoogenboom et al (2016) offers a novel method to fluorescently label plant glycans with high specificity and low toxicity.</p>

<p>Galactic cosmic rays are a significant source of high-energy radiation and may pose a health hazard to those involved in deep space missions. <sup>56</sup>Fe ions, a component of such rays, have previously been shown to affect memory in juvenile mice, though the mechanisms underlying such effects were unclear. In this study published in <em>BMC Genomics</em>, the authors investigated the effects of <sup>56</sup>Fe ion radiation on the cognitive function of 6-month old mice.

<p>Physical activity is often recommended to men diagnosed with prostate cancer, in order to counteract the side effects that treatments often have on their quality of life. Whilst previous trials to promote physical activity in men have been hampered by short follow-up periods and the clinical settings, it is hoped that the study protocol published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> will provide some empirical data obtained in a real-world setting. In this trial, participation in community-based football (soccer) forms the basis in which to assess the effectiveness such activities have on health promotion and in promoting long-term physical activity.

<p>There is now growing evidence that there are some modifiable risk factors that affect the onset of dementia: “diabetes, midlife hypertension and obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity, and low educational attainment”. However, as yet, little is known about the effects that environmental risk factors may have on dementia. In this systematic review, it would appear that there is moderate evidence that dementia risk may be affected by air pollution, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields amongst other factors.</p>

<p>Due to evolutionary pressures in mammals, it is a general pattern that males are often larger than their female counterparts, both in body size and mass. However, this isn’t often the case in tree and flying squirrels. New research using data collected over 22 years seems to support this idea in Siberian flying squirrels, which has shown that females were generally larger than males throughout the year.</p>

<p>DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) are important molecules that can trigger innate immune responses in both plants and animals. This <em>BMC Plant Biology</em> mini-review from Hyong Woo Choi and Daniel F.

<p>Tuberculous meningitis, caused by an infection of the meninges by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a serious condition that is often accompanied by high death or disability rates, particularly in developing nations. Although this disease is well characterized in Vietnamese adults, there is little data on how this disease manifests and affects children in Vietnam. This <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> study aimed to address this by describing the current practices in disease management, as well as presenting the predictors of poor outcome. The authors conclude that much research is still necessary in developing strategies to treat afflicted children in order improve clinical outcomes.</p>

            A new paper could prompt a rethink of a basic tenet of neuroscience. It is widely believed that the motor cortex, a region of the cerebral cortex, is responsible for producing movements, by sending instructions to other brain regions and ultimately to the spinal cord. But according to neuroscientists Christian Laut Ebbesen and colleagues, the truth may be the opposite: the motor cortex may equally well suppress movements.



Ebbesen et al. studied the vibrissa motor cortex (VMC) of the rat,

            <p>Addiction is a medical condition in which the person has uncontrollable desire to take a substance or engage in an activity, despite knowing that it may lead to adverse effects. Taking that substance or engaging in that activity will make the person feel good. Does sugar fit the bill? Clearly yes, as so many of us cannot control cravings for something sweet.</p>
<p>Sugar is used daily by most of us. Modern food is very rich in sugar and this abundance of sugar is viewed as one of the main reasons for growing obesity epidemics. Overconsumption of sugar does not only results in a flood of extra calories – it can also lead to addiction. Sugar can interact with different substances in the brain, influencing and changing their normal levels. Most notably, it affects the level of dopamine. It can also change the concentration of some receptors in the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/06/26/blood-glucose-and-the-brain-sugar-and-short-term-memory/">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The most common form of sugar in our food is sucrose. When ingested, this sugar is split in the digestive system into its two constituents, glucose and fructose. Insulin and glucagon are two enzymes most important for the metabolism of glucose. They both regulate the level of glucose in the human body.</p>
<p>After ingestion and degradation of sugar, glucose molecules are absorbed and distributed to all organs and cells in the body. A group of proteins called GLUCs are responsible for transportation of glucose in the blood. GLUT1 is the main transporter of glucose to the brain.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/02/02/willpower-glucose-and-belief/">glucose</a> reaches destination cells, it has to go inside the cells where it is consumed. There are different mechanisms to achieve this aim. Some cells, such as red blood cells, use passive transport, also known as diffusion, to get the glucose from the blood plasma. Many other cells use active transport mechanisms to deliver glucose inside the cells.</p>
<p>One of the human tissues which cannot tolerate low levels of glucose is brain tissue. The main reason for that is the inability of neurons to store glucose and use that stored glucose when levels decrease. That is the reason why the human brain is the first in line for the glucose supply. The brain is also the biggest burner of glucose in the human body.</p>
<p>Some people might say that they eat candies to feel happy. And they are not wrong. Sugar increases the release of neurotransmitter serotonin, which gives a person the happy feeling.  The catch is that sugar also causes the release of insulin which eventually normalizes the glucose level, and when glucose is back to relatively low levels, we will again strive to take sugar just to feel happy again. This may lead to a vicious circle of constantly eating sweets just to feel good. The result is overeating and possible addiction.</p>
<p>We all know how much children love sweets and sugar. That love is not a consequence of habits and upbringing, though. Recently, researchers have found out that childrens’ love for candies is caused by the biology of their brain. The concentration of neurotransmitters and their receptors is different in children compared to adults. That difference slowly reduces while we grow older. The problem is, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/30/is-sugar-the-new-cocaine/">sugar addiction</a> can be formed early in childhood and stay for the rest of life.</p>
<p>Another problem with sugar addiction is the fact that the human brain reacts differently to the different types of sugar that we ingest. There are big differences between brain reactions to glucose and fructose. For example, our body will need much less glucose to feel good and to trigger the impulses that tell us to stop eating. With fructose the situation is rather different. The human body needs much more fructose to suppress eating.</p>
<p>Researchers from Yale School of Medicine discovered this phenomenon using  functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis. They conducted their study on healthy non-obese subjects. The scientists used fMRI to detect different brain reactions on glucose and fructose. After taking glucose, there was a reduction of blood flow in brain areas responsible for appetite, the reward system, and motivation. It also caused immediate satisfaction. Fructose ingestion did not cause these changes in blood flow.</p>
<p>The problem is that fructose is often used in modern food and drinks. Since the human brain can’t regulate fructose ingestion properly, it may lead to food-seeking behavior, overeating, and eventually obesity.</p>
<p>There is a number of different cells in the human brain, each with a different set of functions. Glial cells surround neurons and provide them with support. One type of glia cells are <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/03/the-many-emerging-roles-of-astrocytes/">astrocytes</a>, which play an important role in creating the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier controls the movement of substances between brain tissue and blood in both directions. New research studies show that the functions of astrocytes can be controlled by enzymes such as insulin and leptin.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Technical University of Munich found that astrocytes play an important role in glucose intake. They have insulin receptors on their surface that react to glucose in blood. PET scans indicated that insulin can interact with astrocytes and regulate their permeability to glucose that will result in differences in the brain levels of glucose. When astrocytes in the parts of the brain responsible for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/24/making-decisions-on-a-hangry-impulse/">appetite</a> get activated, this leads to the feeling of satisfaction. However, when these astrocytes are not reached by glucose, they do not get activated and the person will continue to strive for glucose.</p>
<p>Despite resent discoveries, sugar addiction and especially its mechanisms of action in the brain remain poorly studied. A better understanding of this phenomenon may pave the way to more effective therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing obesity.</p>

            <img alt="Public domain" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/seal-1718007-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>For most land living mammals, a lack of oxygen usually results in irreversible damage to the brain within a few minutes. One of the reasons why this happens is because this highly active tissue cannot cope with the imbalance between energy production and demand under oxygen deficient conditions (also known as hypoxia). On the other hand, the brains of diving mammals, such as whales and seals, may survive recurrent and extended periods of hypoxia caused by diving without damage.</p>
<p>To some degree, this cerebral tolerance is credited to the combination of behavioural, anatomical and physiological diving adaptations, such as a lowering of the heart rate and constriction of peripheral blood vessels. Far less studied are cellular and molecular adaptations in the brains of the diving mammals that possibly contribute to their hypoxia tolerance as well.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the idea that cellular and molecular mechanisms do play a role arose from electrophysiological studies of brain slices from the hooded seal <em>Cystophora cristata</em>. This seal is an expert diver with recorded dives of up to 1 hour and depths of more than 1000m. When challenged with hypoxia <em>in vitro</em>, the neurons of this arctic phocid seal remained active for an extended period, while mice neurons died immediately.</p>
<p>In our article, we investigated the molecular adaptations of the hooded seal using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We first obtained a transcriptome of the visual cortex of the hooded seal with more than 10,000 transcripts. Then, the mRNA levels were compared with those in the cortex of a close terrestrial relative, the ferret. We found in the seal brain a general reduction of the expression levels of genes related to energy metabolism. Most importantly, we identified two potential candidate genes which have an unusually high expression level in the seal brain and thus may contribute to its unusual hypoxia tolerance.</p>
<p>The highest mRNA level in seal cortex was found for clusterin (CLU), which is a chaperone with a variety of functions. For example, CLU interferes with the BAX-mediated apoptosis pathway, thereby promoting cell survival. The high level of CLU in the seal brain can be interpreted either as a preadaptation that protects it from the damage associated with dives or as a consequence of the stressful condition during or after a dive.</p>
<p>The largest difference in the mRNA levels between the hooded seal and the ferret brain was found for S100B, which is highly expressed in the seal brain. S100B is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding stress protein with functions such as regulation of cell proliferation and activation of astrocytes during brain damage and diseases. Most interestingly, further comparative analyses of the available brain transcriptomes showed that S100B mRNA levels were also high in the minke and the bowhead whale, but low in terrestrial mammals. Thus, S100B seems to be component of a common adaptation mechanism that evolved convergently in whales and seals to better survive the reduced oxygen supply during dives.</p>
<p>However, this is not the end of the story. The functions of these two candidates in dive adaptation must be further investigated since, for example, S100B may also promote cancer, and CLU is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases in humans as well as being associated with aging.</p>

            <p>In this talk I will present a paper [1] about a thalamocortical network model I will use as part of my research. I will start by providing a brief summary of the background and the research questions.</p>
<p>Our collaborators at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, found that it is possible to stop epileptic absence seizures by exciting cerebellar nucleus (CN) neurons in a closed loop system (this work was done together with a former PhD student, Parimala Alva, [2]). In my PhD work, I will try to understand the mechanisms underlying the termination of seizures by optogenetic stimulation of CN neurons. For this purpose, I will use a thalamocortical network model of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons, as described in [1].</p>
<p>In the paper [1] the occurrence of Asynchronous Irregular (AI) states in thalamocortical networks of non-linear integrate-and-fire neurons has been investigated together with the role of spike-frequency adaptation. The main findings are that the thalamocortical networks can display AI states or Up-Down state dynamics, depending on the level of adaptation in cortical cells.</p>

            <p>Cancer is challenging to treat. Despite recent advances in earlier diagnostics and targeted therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the mainstream treatments to complement surgery.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is an umbrella term referring to multiple aggressive drugs administered to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/">cancer</a> patients. What unites them is the way they work by targeting fast dividing cells in the body. The therapy can reduce the size of tumors and/or patient’s symptoms. In some cases, chemotherapy can even destroy all cancer cells in the body and lead to complete recovery. But despite its relative efficiency, chemotherapy is associated with a large number of undesirable and often severe side effects. Cancer cells are not the only fast dividing cells in the body, and the lack of specificity associated with the use of chemotherapeutic agents means that normal non-cancerous cells can also be targeted and killed by these drugs.</p>
<p>The most affected tissues include bone marrow, hair follicles, the cells of gastrointestinal tract and reproductive cells. But other organs and tissues such as the brain can also become affected by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>It is well know that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/03/11/this-is-your-brain-this-is-your-brain-on-chemotherapy/">chemotherapy</a> can cause decline in cognitive functions. There is a term used for that cognitive impairment – chemobrain. The condition is characterized by reduced cognitive abilities, impaired motor functions, loss of memory, and weaker attention. At least some symptoms of cognitive decline are often observed after chemotherapy and can cause severe problems for patients.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind the chemobrain phenomenon are poorly studied. Researchers believe that genetic factors play some role in cognitive decline after chemotherapy. These genetic risk factors may include weaker mechanisms of DNA repair,  lower capacity for repairing neurons, and lower activity of neurotransmitters in the brain.</p>
<p>Impairment of cognitive functions can be expected in a short period after chemotherapy, but in most cases it disappears quickly. However, in some cases the impairment persists and can last for a long period of time. In one recent study, a mouse model was used to test the effects of chemotherapy on the cognitive functions in a longer run (three months in this particular case). The results clearly show that animals subjected to chemotherapy agents learned new tasks much slower. Their neurons lived a shorter period of time and differentiated more slowly. This study was designed to test the effects of drugs given to post-menopausal women undergoing chemotherapy treatment for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/21/breast-cancer-catching-it-early/">breast cancer</a>. The study also provided evidence that omega-3 fatty acids do not have any positive effect on reducing the symptoms of cognitive impairment after chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Another study that was also conducted using laboratory animals focused on the changes in level of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Researchers used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to detect levels of the neuromediators. They compared the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brains of mice which were receiving chemotherapy, and in the brains of the control group of mice that did not receive chemotherapy. The results demonstrated that the release of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/20/the-role-of-serotonin-and-glutamine-in-aggression/">serotonin</a> and dopamine is impaired after chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Human studies of chemobrain focused mostly on breast cancer sufferers, and the data described below were gathered on this group of patients. There are good reasons to believe that the results will be similar for other types of cancer too.</p>
<p>One study compared the total brain volume in individuals with breast cancer that used chemotherapy and the total brain volume in the control group without cancer. The study was important as it examined the long-term consequences of chemotherapy on human brain volume. Researchers measured the total brain volume 21 years after chemotherapy. Their results show a significant loss of total brain volume and a loss of grey brain matter. The white matter remained mainly unaffected. The scientists think that this loss of total brain volume and grey matter may lead to the development of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>A similar research study was conducted on another group of patients with breast cancer. The study mainly focused on the changes in the brain’s white and grey matter after chemotherapy. The measurements were done 9 years after the chemotherapy. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect any changes. The findings show that there is a link between chemotherapy and changes in the structure of the human brain. Chemotherapy causes damage to white matter, specifically axonal degeneration and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/02/promoting-remyelination-in-multiple-sclerosis-an-interview-on-rhigm22/">demyelination</a>, but also it is harmful for the grey matter.</p>
<p>Another study was conducted on almost 200 female breast cancer patients that had chemotherapy 20 years ago. Researchers used neuropsychological tests to determine the level of cognition among these patients and in a cancer-free control group. The results showed significantly worse scores in the chemotherapy group compared to the control group. The cancer patients had problems with verbal <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/22/uncovering-the-secrets-of-memory-to-reverse-damage-in-alzheimers-patients/">memory</a> and psychomotor speed and functioning. These problems are the same as those occurring shortly after chemotherapy. This indicates that the patterns of cognitive impairment do not change even after a long period of time post-chemotherapy.</p>
<p>A very recent study compared the integrity of white matter in females with breast cancer before and after chemotherapy. Scientists assessed and compared the cognition scores before and after the treatment. Also, they performed the same tests on a group of females with breast cancer which did not undergo chemotherapy. The findings show significantly weaker test results in the chemotherapy group.  In this group, there were notable changes in the white matter in frontal, parietal, and occipital tracts.</p>
<p>Although cancer chemotherapy does work very well for many cancer patients, most certainly it can also cause dangerous and permanent brain damage. Chemotherapy can change how the brain works through changing the level of neurotransmitters. It can even change the structure of the brain, reducing its volume and reducing grey matter in the brain. Eventually this leads to cognition impairment which is strongest shortly after finishing the chemotherapy but can persist for decades after.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>The number of overweight and obese people (those with BMI above 25) around the world is approaching the two billion mark. This is more than 20% of estimated 7.4 billion people currently populating the planet. The connection between obesity and various chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some types of cancer is well established. Not much, however, is known about how the excess body weight influences the structure and function of brain.</p>
<p><strong>Does IQ level determines body weight?</strong></p>
<p>Statistically significant correlation between excess body weight and lower IQ level has been demonstrated in multiple studies. What was not clear for very long time is the direction of causality. Does the excess body weight cause the decline in intellectual capabilities? Or maybe people with lower IQ level are more prone to become overweight?</p>
<p>Although some earlier studies concluded that lower IQ level might be caused by obesity, the most recent prospectively longitudinal studies show that this is not correct. These studies demonstrate that one of the risk factors for obesity is lower IQ level.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in 2010 summarized 26 different studies on this topic. The main conclusion of this analysis was that there is a strong link between lower IQ level in childhood and the development of obesity in adulthood.</p>
<p>In one Swedish study involving 5286 males the IQ level was tested at the age of 18 and again at the age of 40. At each testing, the BMI of participants was also evaluated. The results clearly show that individuals with lower IQ level have higher BMI.</p>
<p>Another study performed in New Zealand included 913 participants. Their IQ levels were measured at the ages of 3, 7, 9, 11 and finally at the age of 38. This study also concluded that lower IQ level in childhood leads to obesity. People with lower IQ level at the age of 38 were more obese than people with higher IQ level.</p>
<p>Over 3000 people were participating in a study conducted in the Great Britain. The subjects were followed for more than 50 years. Their IQ levels were measured at the age of 7, 11 and 16. At the age of 51, their BMI was measured. Their results show without any doubt that IQ level at the age of 7 can predict higher BMI at the age of 51. Also, the results show that BMI grows faster after the age of 16 among people with lower IQ level.</p>
<p>Another study conducted in the Great Britain involved 17,414 individuals. The IQ level was assessed at the age of 11. BMI was evaluated at the ages of 16, 23, 33 and 42. The results of this study also confirm that lower childhood IQ level leads to obesity in adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity leads to faster aging of brain</strong></p>
<p>Our <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/20/obesity-food-takes-over-the-brain/">brain</a> changes during the natural aging process. As we become older, the brain loses white matter and shrinks. But the rate of aging process is not the same for every person. Individual factors may lead to faster or slower age-related brain changes. One of these factors that affects our brain structure is excess body weight. Obesity alters the normal aging process by speeding it up.</p>
<p>Research study conducted at the University of Cambridge concluded that obese people have less white matter in their brain compared to normal weight individuals. The brain structure of 473 individuals was investigated in this study. The data showed that the brain of obese people appears to be up to ten years anatomically older in comparison with the normal weight counterparts.</p>
<p>Another study conducted on 733 middle aged individuals showed that obesity is strongly linked with the loss of brain mass. Scientists measured body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of participants and used brain MRI to find and identify the signs of brain degeneration.  The results demonstrated that brain degeneration is more extensive in people with higher BMI, WC, WHR than in normal weight persons. The scientists hypothesize that this loss of brain tissue <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/21/weighing-on-your-mind-obesity-cognition-and-dementia/">may lead to dementia</a>, although there are no hard proofs at present.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity changes the way we feel</strong></p>
<p>Apart from structural changes, obesity can also change the way our brain works. Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters which is involved in reward circuits and motivation. One study concluded that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/05/05/is-obesity-linked-to-adhd/">concentration</a> of available dopamine receptors in the brain is in correlates with BMI. Individuals with higher BMI have a lower concentration of available dopamine receptors that may lead to a lack of pleasure after eating normal size portions and the urge to eat more to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>This view was confirmed by another study which analyzed the response of obese people to milkshakes during a period of time. Their response was analyzed using functional MRI. The measurements were repeated half a year later and showed that brain response was a lot weaker in people who gained excess body weight between two measurements. The researchers concluded that obese individuals feel less satisfaction when eating in comparison to lean individuals, due to a lower concentration of dopamine receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/06/obesity-the-brain-as-a-new-research-focus/">research</a> on the effects of obesity on brain functions are still in infancy but the findings described above are already alarming enough. I think it is important to raise the public awareness about this issue. The negative impact of obesity on general health is well publicized, but hardly anyone ever mentions how bad the excess body weight can be for our cognitive functions.</p>

<p>The evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on the human body is indisputable. Physical activity is a key factor in preserving and restoring health. However, physical activity is more complex than movement of the body. Physical activity is a behavior contingent on motivation influenced by societal structures and cultural values.</p>
<p>Think for one minute why you (if motivated) choose to be physically active. Are you physically active <em>simply</em> to avoid disease and for the prospect of living 6-8 years longer? If you are, you may be characterized as an extremely rational person. However, if you’re like most people in the western world, whose basic needs are fulfilled, your choice to be physically active has to do also with fulfillment of more subtle intrinsic values (i.e. competence, autonomy and relatedness).</p>
<p>If you exercise regularly, you probably choose so for the excitement of achieving a personal goal, to look good, to feel good and/or to be around friends – and movement of your body is merely a means. From engagement in numerous studies of exercise behavior in different patient populations (primarily cancer and arthritis), I will argue, that this is also the case if you’re confronted with a serious disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Physical activity for individuals with a serious disease</strong></h3>
<p>Individuals who have been diagnosed with a serious disease, and who know that they have an elevated risk of dying, may choose to become more physically active as a consequence of a more conscious way of living and as a way of coping; they ride the crest of the diagnosis as a teachable moment. However, in terms of <em>adoption</em> of physical activity, patients are not that different from the average healthy person. Therefore, simple exercise recommendations, let alone warnings against sedentary behavior, are most likely to be insufficient in the long run.</p>
<p>Patients may experience more barriers towards physical activity (e.g. fatigue, pain, deteriorated body image and lack of self-efficacy); but at the same time strive for normality and distraction from their illness. Therefore, promotion of physical activity in health care including prevention of co-morbidity and development of secondary diseases, requires interventions, that will ensure safety and physiological efficacy without compromising the intrinsic values imperative for sustainment of the behavior. Moreover, the intervention must be easily accessible and possible to implement at low costs.</p>
<h3><strong>Community based football</strong></h3>
<p>One such novel intervention could be community-based football (soccer), which is currently being examined in the context of prostate cancer survivorship care in Denmark. The FC Prostate Community trial is an ongoing randomized multicenter study aiming to examine the effectiveness of community-based football in men with prostate cancer – regardless of treatment status and potential previous experience with football.</p>
<p>The study protocol recently published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> describes how the study as well as the intervention is pragmatically designed to improve generalization and implementation. Changes in bone health and body composition are secondary to changes in quality of life based on the idea that sustainment of the football training (and thus the expected health effects) is associated with a subjective improvement in quality of life.</p>
<p>In Denmark, as in many other countries around the world, football is the sport that arouses the most passion. Our previous qualitative research suggests that prostate cancer survivors’ perception of football is pivotal for their enrolment and sustainment. Football connotes male values, and is therefore especially attractive for men whose masculinity has be threatened by the prostate cancer diagnosis and anti-hormone treatment. In the context of community-based football, men with prostate cancer can exchange their worries and express mutual understanding without taking on the role as patients. As participants in the FC Prostate Community trial, they can feel safe knowing that their coach has undergone special training and employs an evidence-based training manual intended to prevent injuries.</p>
<p>While men with prostate cancer may be motivated to enrol in community-based football because they wish to achieve or maintain their physical health, they s<em>tay</em> motivated because of the positive relations to peers and because of the excitement of scoring a goal; they stay motivated because of what the activity enables them to feel and become. As such, their continued motivation towards physical activity may not be that different from yours or mine – although I doubt that I personally will ever feel competent playing football. Football will not be for everyone, but everyone deserves to be engaged in physical activity for other reasons than mere protection from disease.</p>

            <p>New research shows that the drug makes cells in the retina more sensitive to light</p><p>25 years ago, pharmacologist M. E. West of the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, noted that local fisherman who smoke cannabis or drink rum made with the leaves and stems of the plant had “an uncanny ability to see in the dark,” which enabled them to navigate their boats through coral reefs. “It was impossible to believe that anyone could navigate a boat without compass and without light in such treacherous surroundings,” he <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w0qvkVGO0sgC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Cannabis+and+night+vision+west&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Do0fXMEKQy&amp;sig=Qy3q2DtB3dgnfsYdkku3iDQKgdw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTnrmbjvjPAhUEB8AKHfquBtEQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Cannabis%20and%20night%20vision%20west&amp;f=false">wrote</a> after accompanying the crew of a fishing boat one dark night, “[but] I was then convinced that the man who had taken the rum extract of cannabis had far better night vision than I had, and that a subjective effect was not responsible.”</p><p>Some of these crew members told West that Moroccan fishermen and mountain dwellers experience a similar improvement after smoking hashish, and in 2002, another research team travelled to the Rif mountains in Morocco to investigate further. They gave a synthetic cannabinoid to one volunteer, and hashish to three more, then used a newly developed <a href="http://www.lkc.com/downloads/Brochures/SST-1%20Brochure%20060328%20P.pdf">piece of kit</a> to measure the sensitivity of their night vision before and after.

<p>If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be
possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short
positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this
principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived.
Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations
of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also
applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate
bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive
the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the
possibility of default.</p>

These efforts span the range of ways we are accelerating access to discovery of not just the final publication but the <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/innovation/#loc-our-progress" target="_blank">entire research life cycle</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Stake a Claim</strong></p>
<p>An additional strategy – early posting of articles before formal peer review through the use of preprints – can also advance science faster, more openly and with broader participation. In posting preprints, authors are able to make their findings immediately available to the scientific community and to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563" target="_blank">receive feedback on draft manuscripts</a></strong> before they are submitted to journals. The benefit extends beyond making early work openly and freely available prior to or during consideration at a journal; in posting a preprint, an author or author group stakes an intellectual claim to methods, results and ideas contained within that paper. This can be especially important for scientists looking to change the focus of their research and connect with engaged colleagues in new fields; for those on the job market needing to show the status of their current research, their collaborative nature and their ability to embrace change for a more open way of doing science; and for early career researchers who may find opportunity to interact with new contacts interested in their work.</p>
<p>PLOS supports authors who wish to share early versions of their research manuscripts to receive feedback before – or in parallel to – formal peer review, and <strong><a href="http://www.ascb.org/consensus-grows-preprints-biology-2/" target="_blank">encourages researchers to share via preprint servers</a></strong> either before or after submission to a PLOS journal. Preprints are an excellent way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish intellectual precedence for ideas, methods, results</li>
<li>Receive early feedback from engaged colleagues</li>
<li>Obtain and document citations to a work before publication in a peer-reviewed journal</li>
<li>Contribute to accelerating scientific discovery and increasing research efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>PLOS has a long-standing policy of accepting manuscripts previously posted to preprint servers, however we recently collaborated with bioRxiv to ease the process as a reflection of the importance we assign to this rapid dissemination vehicle for authors that also brings transparency to the review process. Authors can now use bioRxiv’s <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript" target="_blank">direct transfer to journal service drop-down menu</a></strong> to submit directly to PLOS. While authors posting to bioRxiv can choose the reuse options under which to make their article available (various CC BY options or no reuse), licensing terms of PLOS content <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/open-access" target="_blank">has not changed</a></strong>. To inform authors and the public of the current and more seamless arrangement with bioRxiv we have updated our preprint policy on all journal <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-preprint-servers" target="_blank">ethical publishing practice</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines" target="_blank">related manuscript</a></strong> sections as well as the Wikipedia page that describes the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy" target="_blank">landscape of publisher’s preprint policies</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers First</strong></p>
<p>With preprints, authors – not publishers – are in control of when they publicly timestamp their intellectual property as well as when they want it to go for review. They <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/asap-bio-biologists-published-to-the-internet.html" target="_blank">decide when their research paper is ready to post</a></strong> and when they’re ready to submit their paper for formal peer review. In an open environment, the community can evaluate what any individual scientist’s standards are for their work and their online interaction with colleagues. By posting work and commenting on the posted work of others, authors are more in control of their own reputations. In essence, the use of preprints is analogous, in a very public and large-scale version, to the more intimate practice of sending a complete manuscript draft to a colleague to get their opinion with potential to improve the manuscript before submitting to a journal. Some have likened it to going public with a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleo/2015/09/07/on-preprints-in-paleontology/" target="_blank">conference abstract or presentation</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>In the same way that not all Open Access is created equal, not all preprint servers work the same way. Launched in 2013 by <strong><a href="http://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a></strong>, bioRxiv is now in its third year with more than 5,000 preprints posted to the site and more than 1 million article views each month. At bioRxiv, all posted research papers receive a digital object identifier (DOI) that remains associated with the original preprint. When a manuscript is transferred to PLOS from bioRxiv, PLOS stores the preprint DOI; if that manuscript is accepted for publication it then receives a PLOS DOI and we deposit both the preprint and the final article DOI to CrossRef so the <strong><a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/05/members-will-soon-be-able-to-assign-crossref-dois-to-preprints.html" target="_blank">two works can be associated with each other</a></strong>.</p>
<h4>Importantly, whether posting a preprint or submitting to a journal, authors can help themselves ensure full recognition for both the preprint and the final article by <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">including their ORCID iD</a></strong> at all times.</h4>
<p>At PLOS, preprints are acceptable resources for inclusion in the reference section of an article. Should anyone follow a link from an article citation to a preprint that has subsequently been peer reviewed and published, they would be directed from the preprint to the article on the PLOS journal website.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Value Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Preprints <strong><a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Zika-Moves-Quickly-and/237419/" target="_blank">do not diminish the need for reputable peer-reviewed journals</a></strong>. In fact, the combination provides scientists the best of both worlds; preprints accelerate making work public and provide an opportunity for early feedback for those willing to share their work whereas journals provide a mechanism for formal assessment, curation and dissemination. Journals reinforce standards for ethical and reporting guidelines, plagiarism checks, conflicts of interest and work with organizations such as CrossRef to ensure seamless and complete metadata transfer. Publishing in journals has the added benefits of validating the quality of work through rigorous peer review; placing work in context through perspectives, editorials and incorporation into collections; providing opportunities for online dialogue with authors through <strong><a href="http://plos.io/1Jz2DfN" target="_blank">PLOS Science Wednesday AMAs</a></strong> and tracking article influence through <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/09/19/understanding-altmetrics-an-interview-with-stacy-konkiel/" target="_blank">Article-Level Metrics</a></strong>. Our current work with bioRxiv is one more example of how we are putting researchers at the center of science communication and placing authors in control of their manuscripts. In the future, expansion of Aperta to the full suite of PLOS journals and <strong><a href="http://plos.io/2dreNOY" target="_blank">incorporating aspects of community review</a></strong> to our processes will place PLOS in the space necessary to <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/" target="_blank">accelerate dissemination</a> </strong>of research results and conversation surrounding a scholarly work.</p>
<p>Those wanting an objective look at the value of preprints might find <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/" target="_blank">Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine</a></strong> of interest; for a detailed discussion of preprints by one active participant listen to the <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/10/24/the-power-of-preprints-an-interview-with-james-fraser/" target="_blank">PLOScast with James Fraser</a></strong>, Associate Professor at UCSF and a founding member of <strong><a href="http://asapbio.org/" target="_blank">ASAPbio</a>,</strong> an initiative of the biology community to encourage use of preprints. When you’re ready, go ahead, post that paper, place your results and ideas in the mix and we’ll advance science forward faster, together.</p>

I am working in the areas of procedural learning, especially its sleep-related processing. Skill learning is a special case, as unlike the memory of a fact/ episode, it takes time and practice to assimilate. And it is also sub served by different neural structures (e.g. striatum, cerebellum). In my work, I have used brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) as a proxy for skill learning. Modern systems neuroscience approaches of high-density electrophysiological recordings, and causal neural manipulations are making it possible to elucidate the neural basis of procedural learning and I will be covering this area at #SfN16. Additionally, I will also cover research on memory functions of sleep, as well as novel neurotechnology geared towards movement disorders.</p>

            <p>The immune system is our main defense mechanism against disease. Dysfunctions in the immune system are therefore associated with a myriad of complications, including several neurological and mental disorders.</p>
<p>Yet, for a long time the brain and the immune system were considered to be isolated from each other – it was believed that the brain was not supplied by the lymphatic system (which carries white blood cells and other immune cells through a network of vessels and tissues) because no evidence of lymphatic supply to the brain had ever been found.</p>
<p>But recently, a research team from the University of Virginia School of Medicine was able to find lymphatic vessels in the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/01/28/rethinking-an-old-malady/">meninges</a> that cover the brain. This was a huge discovery that shattered the long-standing belief that the brain was “immune privileged,” lacking a direct connection to the immune system.</p>
<p>After discovering the direct link between the brain and the lymphatic system, the same group has demonstrated that immune cells can influence <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/01/childrens-iq-and-fade-out-effect/">learning behavior</a>, exerting their effects apparently from the meninges, the membranes that cover the central nervous system. Now, the same group has shown that the immune system has another surprising effect on the brain – it can directly affect, and even control social behavior, such as the desire to interact with others.</p>
<p>Using mice with impaired immunity, the authors showed that partial elimination of immune cells from the meninges was sufficient to induce deficits in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/01/childrens-iq-and-fade-out-effect/">social behavior</a>. These social deficits were reversed when the mice were repopulated with immune cells. These immune impaired mice also exhibited hyper-connectivity in specific brain regions associated with social behavior. Again, repopulating mice with immune cells reversed the abnormal hyper-connectivity observed. Other functionally connected regions not directly implicated in social function were not affected by a deficiency in adaptive immunity.</p>
<p>Despite their proximity to the brain, immune cells in the meninges don’t enter the brain. Their effects therefore have to be exerted by releasing molecules that can cross into the brain. The authors were able to identify which molecule acts as a messenger between the immune system and the brain in regulating social behavior.</p>
<p>The molecule is called interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and it can be produced by a substantial number of meningeal immune cells. Blocking the production of this molecule caused similar social deficits and abnormal hyper-connectivity in the same brain regions as in immune impaired mice. Restoring the levels of the molecule restored the brain activity and behavioral patterns, through the action of IFN-gamma in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Importantly, the authors also demonstrated that rodents living in a social context (group-housing) had natural increases in the production of IFN-gamma, whereas rodents in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/05/15/anti-stigmatization-social-isolation-and-mental-illness/">social isolation</a> had a marked loss of IFN-gamma. Zebrafish and flies showed a similar pattern.</p>
<p>These striking results thereby show how that a molecule produced by the immune system can have a determining influence on social behavior. But such as the immune system can drive sociability, it is possible that immune dysfunctions may contribute to an inability to have normal social interactions and play a role in neurological and mental disorders characterized by social impairments, such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/20/autism-may-affect-social-development-of-the-brain/">autism spectrum disorder</a>, frontotemporal dementia, and schizophrenia, for example.</p>
<p>Social behavior is crucial for the survival of a species through foraging, protection, breeding, and even, in higher-order species, mental health. On the other hand, social interaction also brought about an increased exposure to different pathogens; as a consequence, our immune system had to develop new ways to protect us from the diseases to which social interaction exposed us. And social behavior is obviously beneficial to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/19/can-the-immune-system-trigger-alzheimers-disease/">pathogens</a>, since it allows them to spread.The authors of the study therefore hypothesized that the relationship between humans and pathogens may have driven the development of our social behavior. There may have been a co-evolutionary pressure to increase an anti-pathogen response as sociability increased, and it is possible that IFN-gamma may have acted as an evolutionary mechanism to simultaneously enhance social behavior while also enhancing our anti-pathogen responses.</p>
<p>The implications and the questions that arise from these findings are tremendous. Is it possible that our immune system modulates our everyday behaviors or even our personality? Can new pathogens influence human behavior? Can we target the immune system while treating neurological or psychiatric disorders? New research avenues are wide open.</p>

            <p>The day-night cycle is one of the most defining patterns of life as we know it. We live in a cyclic environment and circadian rhythms are an essential element in the biology of living organisms.</p>
<p>Many physiological processes are synchronized with the day-night cycle, being modulated by environmental timing cues such as sunlight. Our biological clock must detect the cyclic variations in light in order to manage our physiological functions accordingly. To do so, light changes are sensed by specialized cells in the retina called retinal ganglion cells; these retinal photoreceptors receive light and send information to the brain, more specifically to a structure located in the hypothalamus called suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN neurons then convey temporal information to other tissues, producing synchronized circadian rhythms in many of our bodily processes.</p>
<p>Evolution made us adapt to our cyclic environment and these external cycles have become essential to the maintenance of a healthy state. But modern societies have tainted these cycles. The widespread use of artificial lighting, for example, has heavily disrupted the natural daily light-dark cycle in a way that is far from innocuous. Continuous exposure to light is regarded as a risk factor for frailty, with a number of studies supporting the idea that this disruption in our <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/">circadian rhythms</a> can have a significant impact on health.</p>
<p>This is a major issue since it is estimated that about 75% of the world’s population may be exposed to light during the night. Also, shift work is considerably common (around 20% of workers in Europe and 29% in the US), and epidemiological studies have shown that shift workers have an increased occurrence of breast cancer, metabolic syndrome, obesity, bone dysfunctions, cardiovascular disease, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/05/shift-work-linked-with-risk-of-severe-stroke/">stroke</a> and sleep impairments.</p>
<p>But although these studies indicate a correlation between <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/15/turn-off-your-screens-before-turning-in/">artificial light</a> exposure and health issues, a causal relationship is hard to determine in human studies. Animal research has helped us understand the real impact of circadian rhythm disruption and has revealed a number of mechanisms through which it can influence health. However, most studies used relatively brief periods of light exposure disruption which largely fail to reproduce the patterns of light exposure in some human contexts, such as shift work, or intensive care settings and nursing homes, for example.</p>
<p>A recent study has set about filling this gap by investigating the relationship between a long-term disruption of circadian rhythms and disease. In this work, mice were exposed to continuous light for 24 weeks and several health parameters were measured: rhythmicity in the central clock (the SCN), skeletal muscle function, bone microstructure, and immune system function were assessed at various time points during and following the 24 weeks of continuous light.</p>
<p>The findings showed that a disrupted circadian rhythm induces detrimental effects on several biological processes. Neuronal recordings revealed that the long-term exposure to continuous light caused a marked reduction in rhythmicity in the circadian pacemaker in the brain, the SCN. Continuous light also reduced muscle function, caused bone changes, and induced a transient pro-inflammatory state.</p>
<p>In fact, many of these changes were consistent with a state of accelerated aging, namely the decline in muscle strength, physical endurance and motor coordination which are often observed in elderly adults.</p>
<p>Relevant changes in bone structure were also observed. Bones are formed by two types of bone tissue: trabecular (or spongy) bone and cortical (or compact) bone. As one ages, spongy bone becomes less dense, whereas compact bone tends to thicken. The continuous exposure to light in mice induced a progressive loss of trabecular bone similar to that observed in early age-related osteoporosis, and an increased thickness of cortical bone consistent with an accelerated effect of aging. Up to 21% of elderly adults have osteoporosis and some of these changes have actually been reported in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/02/15/seasonal-affective-disorder-created-by-a-productivity-centered-society/">shift workers</a>: studies have shown that female shift workers have an increased risk of bone fractures and decreased bone mineral density.</p>
<p>Continuous exposure to light also induces a heightened pro-inflammatory state. Upon an immune stimulus, mice exposed to continuous light showed an increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules and a decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory compounds, even though this effect was transient. This intensified pro-inflammatory state is also observed during aging. Furthermore, human studies have also shown that shift workers have an increased risk of cancer and metabolic syndrome associated with immune system dysfunction, which is also known to aggravate age-related pathologies.</p>
<p>The reduction in rhythmicity in the SCN of mice continuously exposed to light also matches rhythm changes that occur in aged individuals. In fact, recent research suggests that impairments in the circadian clock within the SCN may be a defining <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/15/why-do-we-need-to-sleep/">factor in aging</a>, being likely that an aged circadian system may actually contribute to the age-related decline in health.</p>
<p>This study solidified the notion that long-term exposure to continuous light can have a significant impact on health. Interestingly, most of the health parameters measured quickly returned to normal after restoring a regular light-dark cycle. Nevertheless, it becomes clear that exposure to artificial light is not at all harmless. By messing with our circadian rhythms through constant exposure to light, we may be accelerating our aging process and be actively weakening our health and resistance to disease.</p>

            <p>Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. But can stroke be prevented? Probably not totally, but it sure is possible to drastically reduce the odds of having a stroke. A huge international study on the risk factors for stroke recently published in <em>The Lancet</em> has shown that the majority are potentially modifiable behaviors.</p>
<p>The study was carried out between 2007 and 2015, with over 13000 patients with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/12/technology-for-acute-strokes-interview-with-brainattack-app-developer/">acute first stroke</a> (and a similar number of healthy controls) being recruited in 32 countries across Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. This study also assessed how risk factors vary between stroke subtype, throughout the world, and according to age or sex.</p>
<p>Overall, it was established that over 90% of the worldwide risk of stroke can be attributed to only ten <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/05/shift-work-linked-with-risk-of-severe-stroke/">risk factors</a>: hypertension, low physical activity, high apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (predictor of coronary heart disease risk), diet, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, current smoking, cardiac causes, alcohol consumption, and diabetes. Of these, hypertension was identified as the most important risk factor for stroke.</p>
<p>Some risk factors were shown to be predominantly associated with a subtype of stroke. Hypertension, although highly risky for both subtypes, was more associated with cerebral hemorrhage; smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins, and cardiac causes, on the other hand, were more associated with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/01/treating-acute-ischemic-stroke-the-race-is-on/">ischemic stroke</a>.</p>
<p>These risk factors were consistent across world regions, sex, and age groups. Still, some sex differences were observed: abdominal obesity and cardiac causes were associated with larger odds in women than in men, while the risk associated with smoking and alcohol intake was greater among men than in women, but in this case it was most likely due to the higher prevalence of smoking and drinking in men. Age differences were also found: hypertension, abdominal obesity, and cardiac factors increased the odds of stroke in younger individuals, whereas diet had a stronger association with stroke in older adults.</p>
<p>Overall, the combined contribution of these ten risk factors to stroke risk was consistent in all populations, but there were some interesting regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, providing an indication of how lifestyle and cultural behaviors define the impact of each risk factor. In fact, the most remarkable conclusion to be taken from this data is that all of the major risk factors for stroke can be potentially modified by lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Dietary changes are the most obvious target in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/07/the-20-second-test-for-stroke-risk/">stroke prevention</a>. A healthy diet can help reduce hypertension, the most important risk factor for stroke, the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, which indicates the relative levels of bad and good cholesterol, abdominal obesity, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Indeed, a healthier diet was associated with a lower risk of stroke in most regions. However, there was an interesting finding that highlights how there can be misconceptions on what a healthy diet is. A <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/05/shift-work-linked-with-risk-of-severe-stroke/">“healthier diet”</a> did not reduce the risk of stroke in of south Asia and Africa; in fact, in south Asia, a seemingly healthier diet seemed to even be associated with an increased risk of stroke. This seems counterintuitive, but it is actually most likely due to not-so-healthy options in south Asian diet. For example, the combined intake of fruit and vegetables in south Asia is lower than in other regions. Even though a large proportion of the population in south Asia is vegetarian (about 40%) and the consumption of vegetables is very high, recent studies have shown that south Asia has one of the lowest intakes of fruit in the world, that there has been a decrease in the consumption of whole plant foods, and that there is a high use of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based ghee in cooking, which is not that healthy.</p>
<p>Regardless of regional differences, keeping in mind that the ten risk factors mentioned above account for around 90% of the risk of having a stroke, what stands out in this study is that stroke can be largely prevented by modifying behaviors.</p>
<p>And it’s not only diet that can be changed. Given the tremendous impact of hypertension, a great reduction in the occurrence of stroke may be achieved through control of blood pressure. Regular exercise can obviously counterbalance the effects of physical inactivity as well as contribute to metabolic improvements. Moderate alcohol intake and quitting smoking are also obvious actions towards stroke prevention.</p>

            <p>Growing up in a well-off home can benefit a child’s physical health even decades later, but a lack of parent-child warmth, or the presence of abuse, may eliminate the health advantage of a privileged background, according to a Baylor University study.</p>
<p>Assistant professor of sociology at Baylor University, Matthew A. Andersson, Ph.D., explains: </p>
<blockquote><p>Previous research has associated high socioeconomic status with better childhood nutrition, sleep, neighborhood quality, and opportunities for exercise and development of social skills. But good parent-child bonds may be necessary to enforce eating, sleep, and activity routines.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, if parent-child relationships are strained or abusive, meals may be less coordinated among the family, and children may be more likely to eat sugary or high-fat foods as snacks or even in place of meals.</p>
<p>Sleep and activity routines also may become irregular, keeping children from developing healthy lifestyles and social and emotional skills useful for successful aging, Andersson said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although good parent-child bonds in economically disadvantaged homes, promote health, they do not seem to lessen the negative impact of low socioeconomic status as the children age, Andersson said.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown parents with less education and fewer financial advantages are more apt to threaten or force obedience rather than have constructive dialogue, and that may lessen warm relationships.</p>
<p>In addition, disease rates or inflammation among those children when they become adults have been linked strongly to abuse, mistreatment, or lower levels of parental warmth.</p>
<p>The study on Midlife Health and Parent-Child Relationships appears in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior.</p>
<p>For the study, health at midlife was defined as being free from 28 possible conditions, among them cancer, circulatory or respiratory disease, endocrine diseases, nervous system diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, skin or digestive disease, and musculoskeletal conditions. Andersson explains the take-home message: </p>
<blockquote><p>Much research continues to view socioeconomic status and parent-child bonds as highly related or even interchangeable. But in fact they may quite independently influence a child’s well-being. The key takeaway is that without adequate parent-child relationship quality to match, socioeconomic advantage during childhood may not offer much protection at all against major chronic disease as children become adults and reach middle age.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the study, Andersson analyzed data on disease or poor health of middle-aged adults drawn from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS).</p>
<p>He surveyed 2,746 respondents ages 25 to 75 in 1995 about their childhood treatment by parents. He conducted surveys again about 10 years later, with 1,692 of the individuals taking part.</p>
<p>The follow-up analysis, adjusted for personal background in 1995 and for probability of dropping out of the MIDUS study, revealed that childhood abuse continued to undermine any protection from disease linked to childhood socioeconomic advantage.</p>
