                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_300375879.jpeg.iCeovfbJMUANAA.5Kb7mJqTKJ-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>John Ioannidis’ 2005 article <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a> was an uncomfortable wake-up call for many in the scientific community. The paper has led many to take a more critical eye to published research, leading to a wave of high-profile retractions and several major studies warning of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">reproducibility</a><u> </u>crisis in science. So great is this concern that it has moved out of the academic sphere with governments and regulators taking an interest, such as the 2021 call from the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/562">UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee </a>for evidence on reproducibility and research integrity across research institutions.</p>
<p>Alongside the reproducibility crisis the meaning of the term ‘Research Integrity’ has evolved. Originally used to define a governing ethos for best practice in scientific research and the practices it encompasses, Research Integrity has become a research field in its own right spanning sociology, philosophy, statistics, science education and meta-research. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> recently closed its collection on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/reproducibility">Reproducibility and Research Integrity</a>, launched in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/">UK Reproducibility Network</a>. The submissions reflect how this field has matured, shifting focus from identifying problems – to offering solutions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">A popular solution to improving research integrity is to educate aspiring researchers on the importance of robust, reproducible scientific practice. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05862-8#auth-Andreas_D_-Meid">Andreas Meid</a> describes a pilot lecture series created to equip their students with this understanding and gives an honest account of what worked and what did not. Dr Meid’s lectures placed focus on developing statistical skills, an approach supported by <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05965-w">Penny Reynolds</a>. In her commentary, she lays out her case for better statistical education for all investigators as a solution to the pervasive reproducibility issues found in translating pre-clinical research stating <em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Technical education alone is not enough, argue <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06065-5">Ilinca Ciubotariu and Gundula Bosch</a>. They highlight the importance of science-communication to ratify research quality and promote trust in researchers. In their commentary, they showcase the framework of responsible science communication taught to students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. They hope fostering this ethos will promote more transparent and accountable science in the future. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06098-w">Daniel Pizzolato and Kris Dierickx</a> also consider ways to stimulate responsible research practices across the hierarchies of academic institutions. They advocate turning traditional ideas of pedagogy on their head through reverse mentoring, where a junior academic shares their scientific insights with a senior colleague. Such approaches are well established across many other industries; it seems high time for academia to catch up.</p>

<p>Across the collection, many call for change at the institutional level. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05999-0">Olivia Kowalczyk</a> describes how institute heads can cultivate an environment of reproducible, open research by changing funding and hiring criteria to align with such principles. Sweeping changes in how we value research are called for by Stephen Bradley. He argues that funders should stop using citations and impact factors to assess research and instead make judgements based on quality, reproducibility, and societal value. Scientific publishers must also play their part in the pursuit of better science. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05875-3">Patrick Diaba-Nuhoho and Michael Amponsah-Offeh</a> call for journals to promote the publication of unexpected results and null findings to help dispel the distinctly unscientific taboo of publishing null and negative data*.</p>
<h2>Peer Review<img class="wp-image-12982 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png" alt="" width="70" height="70" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-125x125.png 125w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px" /></h2>
<p>Peer review also comes under critique. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6">Robert Schultz</a> ponders the potential of automated screening tools to aid manuscript assessment, hoping it might help to screen a growing influx of new submissions more quickly, allowing reviewers more time to consider the papers they receive. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06016-0">Alexandru Marcoci</a> advocates a total overall to the traditional peer review system. He proposes it be treated like an expert elicitation process, applying methods from mathematics, psychology, and decision theory to mitigate biases and enhance the transparency, accuracy, and defensibility of the resulting judgment. In this way, he argues, peer review will become an intrinsically more transparent and reliable process. An ambitious initiative but perhaps it is time to think big.</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-12986 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-300x300.png" alt="" width="69" height="69" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-125x125.png 125w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 69px) 100vw, 69px" />Collaboration</h2>
<p>I contacted two contributors to the collection with the question, ‘If money were no object – what one initiative would about the greatest improvement in research integrity? One wanted the methods section to be mandated as open access across all journals, believing that transparent methods can lead to better science. The other wished to begin a longitudinal study of academic supervisors and their students to identify the best means to promote reproducible science across generations of researchers. Clearly, potential solutions to the reproducibility crisis are manifold, transcending fields and institutions. In a sentiment echoed across the collection, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05883-3">Andrew Stewart</a> of the UK Reproducibility Network argues that the only way to improve research integrity is to drive systematic change across the key scientific stakeholders: academic institutions, research organizations, funders, publishers, and the government. In agreement, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06108-x">Natasha Drude</a> emphasizes that the research community should <em>&#8220;view initiatives that promote reproducibility not as a one-size-fits-all undertaking, but rather as an opportunity to unite stakeholders and customize drivers of cultural change.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Overall the view of the collection seems cautiously optimistic. Now that we have established the issues of reproducibility and research integrity, perhaps we have a chance to change science for the better. An attitude well summarized in the title of Guest Editor <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05942-3">Marcus Munafò&#8217;s</a> article &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“The reproducibility debate is an opportunity, not a crisis”.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to my predecessor Dr. Tamara Hughes for instigating this collection and to Professor. Marcus Munafò for putting it together.</p>
<p>*I feel I must note that <em>BMC Research Notes</em> welcomes submissions presenting null and negative results.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pahrump-poolfish-desert-isolation-social-cues-fish-fear">After eons of isolation, these desert fish flub social cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Getting out into society after a long isolation gets awkward. Ask the Pahrump poolfish, loners in a desert for some 10,000 years.</p>



<p>This hold-in-your-hand-size fish (<em>Empetrichthys latos</em>) has a chubby, torpedo shape and a mouth that looks as if it’s almost smiling. Until the 1950s, this species had three forms, each evolving in its own spring. Now only one survives, which developed in a spring-fed oasis in the Mojave Desert’s Pahrump Valley, about an hour’s drive west of Las Vegas.<br><br><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devils-hole-pupfish-may-not-have-been-so-isolated-so-long">Fish in a desert are not that weird</a> when you take the long view (<em>SN: 1/26/16</em>). In a former life, some desert valleys were ancient lakes. As the region’s lakes dried up, fish got stuck in the remaining puddles. Various stranded species over time adapted to quirks of their private microlakes, and a desert-fish version of the Galapagos Islands’ diverse finches arose.</p>





<p>“We like to say that Darwin, if he had a different travel agent, could have come to the same conclusions just from the desert,” says evolutionary biologist Craig Stockwell of North Dakota State University in Fargo.<br><br>The desert “island” where <em>E. latos</em> evolved was Manse Spring on a private ranch. From a distance, the spring looked “just like a little clump of trees,” remembers ecologist Shawn Goodchild, who is now based in Lake Park, Minn. The spot of desert greenery surrounded the Pahrump poolfish’s entire native range, about the length of an Olympic swimming pool.</p>



<p>By the 1960s, biologists feared the fish were doomed. The spring’s flow rate had dropped some 70 percent as irrigation for farms in the desert sucked away water. And disastrous predators arrived: a kid’s discarded goldfish. Conservation managers fought back, but neither poison nor dynamite wiped out the newcomers. And then in August of 1975, Manse Spring dried up.</p>



<p>Conservation managers had moved some poolfish to other springs, but the long-isolated species just didn’t seem to get the dangers of living with other kinds of fishes. The poolfish were easily picked off by predators in their new home.</p>



<p>Lab tests of fake fish-murder scenes may help explain why. For instance, researchers tainted aquarium water with pureed fish bits. In an expected reaction, fathead minnows (<em>Pimephales promelas</em>) freaked at traces of dead minnow drifting through the water and huddled low in the tank. The Pahrump poolfish in water tainted with blender-whizzed skin of their kind just kept swimming around the upper waters as if corpse taint were no scarier than tap water. Literally. Stockwell and colleagues can say that because they ran a fear test with nonscary dechlorinated tap water. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2022.0752">Poolfish didn’t huddle then either</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 31 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Then, however, Stockwell and a colleague were musing about some rescued poolfish in cattle tanks when nearby dragonflies caught the researchers’ attention.</p>



<p>Before dragonflies mature into shimmering aerial marvels, the young prowl underwater as violent predators. In moves worthy of scary aliens in a sci-fi movie, many dragonfly nymphs can shoot their jaws out from their head to scoop up prey, including fish eggs and fish larvae. With young dragonflies prowling a pool’s bottom and plants, poolfish moving up the water column “would be a good way to reduce their risk,” Stockwell says. Testing of that idea has begun.</p>



<p>Fish that people thought were foolishly naïve may just be savvy in a different way. Especially after isolation in a desert with dragons.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I outlined three ways PLOS is working to eliminate author fees through new business models. The models we introduced in 2020 began as an experiment to systemically address the barriers publications fees pose for many researchers and prove that APCs are not the only way to support Open Access. More sustainable&ndash;and equitable&ndash;models exist and we&rsquo;re grateful to have partnered with so many institutions that are ready to flip the system.</p>



<h2><strong>Change is coming</strong></h2>



<p>Though we still have more work ahead of us and many more conversations to be had with research stakeholders around the world, I am super gratified to report that as of today, 181 institutions in 26 countries have partnered with us., that&rsquo;s up from 93 and 6, respectively from last year.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a look back at the road to get here so far:</p>



<h2><strong>The new era of Open Access</strong></h2>



<p>PLOS was founded in 2001 with a mission to transform science communication. PLOS journals were some of the earliest Open Access titles in biology and medicine, and a key driver in proving all readers can and should have access to research without barriers. Today, many research <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy">funders</a>, institutions, and <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands">governments </a>now <em>require </em>research to be made available under Open Access licensing<em> and </em>provide funds that can be applied to authors&rsquo; Open Access publication costs. But the ways in which Open Access is supported varies across different fields and <a href="https://council.science/current/blog/plan-s-and-open-access-interview-with-dominique-babini/">global regions</a>. There are gaps that leave many researchers who want to publish in Open Access journals without funding for APCs.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why we embarked on this journey nearly three years ago. We were the vanguard of publishers who demonstrated that Open Access publishing could be sustainable, but we only had half the equation right. In short, we weren&rsquo;t fulfilling our entire vision for an open and inclusive research ecosystem that facilitated the exchange of free and unrestricted knowledge. Anyone could read the research we published, but the cost of publishing in an Open venue was&ndash;and continues to be&ndash;a barrier for many authors.</p>



<h2><strong>Progress towards fee-free publishing</strong></h2>



<p>This year, we have signed three large consortia deals.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-expands-footprint-in-sweden-with-a-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-bibsam-consortium/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-expands-footprint-in-sweden-with-a-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-bibsam-consortium/">Bibsam</a>,<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-consortium-of-swiss-academic-libraries/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-consortium-of-swiss-academic-libraries/">CSAL</a>, and<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-and-irel-sign-three-year-open-access-publishing-agreement/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-and-irel-sign-three-year-open-access-publishing-agreement/">IReL</a>.

<p>At PLOS we are committed to co-creating pathways to Open Access and Open Science as we carry our mission forward. A piece of that is ensuring our approach to Open Access solutions are not one-size-fits-all. It&rsquo;s the reason we don&rsquo;t have just one institutional partnership model for all of our journals, but several that cater to the needs of the journal research communities, and the bodies who financially support researchers&rsquo; work. These include<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">CAP</a>, which keeps costs low for selective journals (and was recently honored with an<a href="https://www.alpsp.org/"> ALPSP award</a>); <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>, which reflects regional economic differences; and our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model that aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers.</p>



<p>The uptake of these models is incredible. Doubling the number of institutions is gratifying, but, on a personal note, I take greater pride in spreading Open Access publishing worldwide. This is great for institutions and PLOS, but even better for researchers. We are as eager as any author to see open-to-publish frameworks become the norm, just as Open Access has taken hold over the past two decades. I&rsquo;m just excited to be playing a part in making that happen. Watch this space for more updates!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-nucleus-oldest-stars-protogalaxy">A protogalaxy in the Milky Way may be our galaxy’s original nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way left its “poor old heart” in and around the constellation Sagittarius, astronomers report. New data from the Gaia spacecraft reveal the full extent of what seems to be the galaxy’s original nucleus — the ancient stellar population that the rest of the Milky Way grew around — which came together more than 12.5 billion years ago.</p>



<p>“People have long speculated that such a vast population [of old stars] should exist in the center of our Milky Way, and Gaia now shows that there they are,” says astronomer Hans-Walter Rix of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>





<p>The Milky Way’s ancient heart is a round protogalaxy that spans nearly 18,000 light-years and possesses roughly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02722">100 million times the mass of the sun in stars</a>, or about 0.2 percent of the Milky Way’s current stellar mass, Rix and colleagues report in a study posted September 7 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“This study really helps to firm up our understanding of this very, very, very young stage in the Milky Way’s life,” says Vasily Belokurov, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work. “Not much is really known about this period of the Milky Way’s life,” he says. “We’ve seen glimpses of this population before,” but the new study gives “a bird’s-eye view of the whole structure.”</p>



<p>Most stars in the Milky Way’s central region abound with metals, because the stars originated in a crowded metropolis that earlier stellar generations had enriched with those metals through supernova explosions. But Rix and his colleagues wanted to find the exceptions to the rule, stars so metal-poor they must have been born well before the rest of the galaxy’s stellar denizens came along — what Rix calls “a needle-in-a-haystack exercise.”</p>



<p>His team turned to data from the Gaia spacecraft, which launched in 2013 on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">a mission to chart the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/22</em>). The astronomers searched about 2 million stars within a broad region around the galaxy’s center, which lies in the constellation Sagittarius, looking for stars with metal-to-hydrogen ratios no more than 3 percent of the sun’s. </p>



<p>The astronomers then examined how those stars move through space, retaining only the ones that don’t dart off into the vast halo of metal-poor stars engulfing the Milky Way’s disk. The end result: a sample of 18,000 ancient stars that represents the kernel around which the entire galaxy blossomed, the researchers say. By accounting for stars obscured by dust, Rix estimates that the protogalaxy is between 50 million and 200 million times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>“That’s the original core,” Rix says, and it harbors the Milky Way’s oldest stars, which he says probably have ages exceeding 12.5 billion years. The protogalaxy formed when several large clumps of stars and gas conglomerated long ago, before the Milky Way’s first disk — the so-called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-history-timeline-evolution-disk">thick disk</a> — arose (<em>SN: 3/23/22</em>).</p>



<p>The protogalaxy is compact, which means little has disturbed it since its formation. Smaller galaxies have crashed into the Milky Way, augmenting its mass, but “we didn’t have any later mergers that deeply penetrated into the core and shook it up, because then the core would be larger now,” Rix says.</p>



<p>The new data on the protogalaxy even capture the Milky Way’s initial spin-up — its transition from an object that didn’t rotate into one that now does. The oldest stars in the proto–Milky Way barely revolve around the galaxy’s center but dive in and out of it instead, whereas slightly younger stars show more and more movement around the galactic center. “This is the Milky Way trying to become a disk galaxy,” says Belokurov, who saw <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/514/1/689/6584853">the same spin-up</a> in research that he and a colleague reported in July.</p>



<p>Today, the Milky Way is a giant galaxy that spins rapidly — each hour our solar system speeds through 900,000 kilometers of space as we race around the galaxy’s center. But the new study shows that the Milky Way got its start as a modest protogalaxy whose stars still shine today, stars that astronomers can now scrutinize for further clues to the galaxy’s birth and early evolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/woodpecker-drumming-bird-brain-behavior-songbirds">Drumming woodpeckers use similar brain regions as songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Songbirds get a lot of love for their dulcet tones, but drummers may start to steal some of that spotlight.</p>



<p>Woodpeckers, which don’t sing but do drum on trees, have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001751">brain regions that are similar to those of songbirds</a>, researchers report September 20 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. The finding is surprising because songbirds use these regions to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-learn-recognize-calls-mom-eggs-nest-sound-song">learn their songs</a> at an early age, yet it’s not clear if woodpeckers learn their drum beats (<em>SN: 9/16/21</em>). Whether woodpeckers do or not, the result suggests a shared evolutionary origin for both singing and drumming.</p>





<p>The ability to learn vocalizations by listening to them, just like humans do when learning to speak, is a rare trait in the animal kingdom. Vocal learners, such as songbirds, hummingbirds and parrots, have independently evolved certain clusters of nerve cells called nuclei in their forebrains that control the ability. Animals that don’t learn vocally are thought to lack these brain features.</p>



<p>While it’s commonly assumed that other birds don’t have these nuclei, “there’s thousands of birds in the world,” says Matthew Fuxjager, a biologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “While we say these brain regions only exist in these small groups of species, nobody’s really looked in a lot of these other taxa.”</p>



<p>Fuxjager and his colleagues examined the noggins of several birds that don’t learn vocally to check if they really did lack these brain nuclei. Using molecular probes, the team checked the bird brains for activity of a gene called <em>parvalbumin</em>, a known marker of the vocal learning nuclei. Many of the birds, including penguins and flamingos, came up short, but there was one exception — male and female woodpeckers, which had three spots in their brains with high <em>parvalbumin </em>activity.</p>



<p>Though woodpeckers don’t sing, they do perform a rapid drumming on trees and house gutters to defend their territories or find mates. This drumming is different from the drilling the birds do to find food. When the team found brain nuclei similar to songbirds in woodpeckers, Fuxjager was immediately intrigued. “I thought right away it’s probably related to drumming,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers subjected downy woodpeckers (<em>Dryobates pubescens</em>) in the wild to audio recordings of drumming from other woodpeckers. This faux territorial invasion sparked an aggressive drumming response from the birds, which were then captured and euthanized to have their recent brain activity analyzed. Sure enough, the same regions identified by earlier lab tests had been activated in the drummers.</p>



<p>The brains of bird vocalists and drummers evolved separately, but the similarity of the analyzed regions hints at a common origin. “It suggests that there are common themes about how you develop these complex behaviors,” says Bradley Colquitt, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study. The neural circuitry formed by these nuclei most likely developed from an ancestral circuit controlling movement, Colquitt says.</p>



<p>“Birdsong is basically the brain controlling muscles in a vocal organ called the syrinx,” Fuxjager says. These sophisticated movements are not unlike the swift head-and-neck motions involved in drumming.</p>



<p>Whether drumming is learned like birdsong remains an open question that the team is now exploring. Future work will also look at how woodpeckers’ brains are wired, how these nuclei control drumming and how the brain regions’ role in drumming evolved across woodpecker species, Fuxjager says.</p>



<p>This new study “uncovers another species that we can add to our comparative efforts” to better understand how complex behaviors evolve, Colquitt says. “It is a preview into potentially exciting evolutionary neurobiology.” Now that woodpeckers have joined the band of important musical birds, it looks like the drummers may soon get their chance to shine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-earliest-gibbon-asia-evolution">Fossil finds put gibbons in Asia as early as 8 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Small-bodied, long-armed apes called gibbons swing rapidly through the trees, far outpacing scientists’ attempts to decipher these creatures’ evolutionary story.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2022.103251">partial upper jaw and seven isolated teeth</a> found near a southwestern Chinese village have added bite to a suggestion that the earliest known gibbons hung out there about 7 million to 8 million years ago, researchers report in the October <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Those fossils, as well as 14 teeth previously found at the same site and a nearby site, belong to an ancient hylobatid species called <em>Yuanmoupithecus xiaoyuan</em>, say paleoanthropologist Xueping Ji of the Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology in China and colleagues. Hylobatids, a family of apes that includes about 20 species of living gibbons and a black-furred gibbon called the siamang, inhabit tropical forests from northeastern India to Indonesia.</p>





<p>Ji’s group has presumed that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was an ancient gibbon since introducing the species in a 2006 Chinese publication. But additional fossils were needed to check that suspicion.</p>



<p>The newly discovered upper jaw piece — found by a local villager and given to Ji during fieldwork around a decade ago — contains four teeth, including a partly erupted molar that helped researchers identify it as the remains of an infant that died before reaching age 2.</p>



<p>Comparisons with modern apes and fossils of ancient primates peg <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>as the oldest known gibbon and cast doubt on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-primates-apes-gibbon-tooth">a two-year-old report that a roughly 13-million-year-old molar tooth found in northern India</a> came from a hylobatid, the team says (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>). The fossil found in India, assigned to a species dubbed <em>Kapi ragnagarensis</em>, represents an extinct group of South Asian primates that were not closely related to present-day apes, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Prior DNA analyses of living primates suggested that hylobatids diverged from other apes in Africa between 22 million and 17 million years ago. But it’s a mystery when gibbon ancestors arrived in Eurasia, says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Terry Harrison of New York University. A gap in the fossil record of about 10 million years exists between the estimated time when hylobatids emerged in or near Africa and evidence of <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>in Asia.</p>



<p>Genetic evidence also indicates that <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-5614-2_4">gibbon species today shared a common ancestor around 8 million years ago</a>, when <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was alive. “It could be that [<em>Y. xiaoyuan</em>] is the ancestor of all later gibbons,” Harrison says. If not, <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was closely related to a modern gibbon ancestor, he suspects.</p>



<p>Bumps and depressions on chewing surfaces and other tooth and jaw features of <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>look much like those of living gibbons, Ji’s team says. Some traits of the fossil species were precursors of slightly different traits in modern gibbons, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Based on molar sizes, they estimate that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>weighed about six kilograms, similar to gibbons today. Molar structure indicates that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>focused on eating fruits, like most gibbon species today, Harrison says.</p>



<p>Ji’s group “makes a very good case that [<em>Y. xiaoyuan</em>] is a hylobatid,” says paleoanthropologist David Alba of Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont in Barcelona.</p>



<p>But the evolutionary status of <em>K. ragnagarensis</em> remains unsettled because only a single tooth from that species has been found, says Alba, who did not participate in the new study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/research-revealed/">Research Revealed</a></h4>

              
                <p>You never know how a discovery may affect future research&mdash;and as much as they try to anticipate the contribution or future application of a paper, neither do editors.</p>



<p>When journals only focus on significance of advance and priority of discovery, valuable information is excluded from the scientific record. Rigorous research that adds supporting evidence, re-examines and broadens our understanding leads to a stronger foundation of knowledge. But without the right ways to share it, many important insights could remain hidden from public view, buried in filing drawers and hard drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At PLOS, we&rsquo;re committed to helping researchers share more of their science&mdash;including contributions that might otherwise be excluded from the scientific record. We use journal policy, specialized articles types, and unique editorial selection criteria to help ensure that important advances receive the respect and attention they deserve. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<h2>1. <strong>The PLOS-wide Complementary Research (or &ldquo;Scooping&rdquo;) Policy</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes, two research groups independently achieve similar results around the same time. When that happens, it can be difficult for the second group to publish their work, because it may no longer meet the novelty requirements for selective journals.</p>



<p>At PLOS, we see complementary findings as a positive, reinforcing the validity of both studies. That&rsquo;s why all of our journals&mdash;even the most selective&mdash;offer scooping protection to ensure that complementary results will not be rejected for novelty within six months of a similar preprint or publication by another group.</p>

</p><h2>2. Registered Reports and Preregistered Research Articles</h2>



<p>Preregistration is the practice of formally depositing a study design in a repository and submitting it for peer review at a journal prior to conducting experiments, data collection or analysis. Evaluating study designs supports a strong methodological approach, increases the credibility and reproducibility of results, and helps address publication bias. Accepted study design protocols receive a provisional acceptance for the future research article reporting the results&mdash;so researchers can proceed with the study knowing that the work <em>will </em>be publishable, no matter the outcome. Preregistration can be especially beneficial for Early Career Researchers, and anyone conducting high risk/high reward research. PLOS offers two options for researchers seeking to preregister their work: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-registered-reports">Registered Reports</a> (<em>PLOS ONE</em>) and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/what-we-publish#loc-preregistered-research-articles">Preregistered Research Articles</a> (<em>PLOS Biology</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right">&ldquo;Preregistering the analysis that you&rsquo;re going to do beforehand doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t do exploratory analysis later, but it does mean that people know what you&rsquo;re actually going to do before you do it.

</p><h2>3. Incremental advances, negative, and null results</h2>



<p>With all the pressure to publish exciting and impactful new results, incremental advances, negative and null outcomes can get left behind&mdash;and left out of the scientific record. Over the long term, this creates knowledge gaps in the literature that can undermine credibility, slow progress, and waste resources.</p>



<p>Small advances, negative outcomes, and inconclusive results <em>do </em>matter. Seemingly minor findings can have major impacts down the line. Small discoveries can plant the seeds for future investigations. In demonstrating what doesn&rsquo;t work, negative and null results can point the way toward alternative solutions which may prove more effective&mdash;not to mention saving other research groups time and resources.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals will consider meaningful negative and null outcomes if the research question they answer is sufficiently relevant to the field&mdash;but we also publish several journals that make incremental, negative and null results essential to their mission and editorial vision: <em>PLOS ONE</em>, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, <em>PLOS Climate</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em>Each of these journals is built on the editorial philosophy that all rigorous, well-conducted research has value, and should be preserved as a part of the permanent scientific record&mdash;including replication studies, as well as negative, and inconclusive results.</p>

<h2>4. That hard-to-place research article</h2>



<p>Interdisciplinary research and studies from emerging fields can be difficult to place in many field-specific journals. Small or specialized editorial boards may lack the expertise necessary to evaluate the work from different angles, scope may rule some excellent research out if it is perceived to be on the edge of the field.&nbsp;<em>PLOS ONE</em> ensures this research finds a home and is discoverable to readers everywhere. Because of the journal&rsquo;s inclusive scope, commitment to rigor instead of novelty or impact, and our broad network of editorial board members with expertise in more than 200 disciplines, all research in the sciences and related disciplines can be evaluated and shared with readers around the world.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Ensuring research reaches the broadest audience</h2>



<p>Even when published, research may remain out of view from audiences who need it. Broadly, Open Access licensing, article promotion and indexing all help ensure published (or preprinted!) research is available to as many people as possible. But where and how research is shared still shapes who sees it.</p>



<p>Many journals are built with a specific community in mind, catering to researchers in a specific field as both authors and readers eager to stay up-to-date on progress from their peers or dive deeper into discoveries and techniques that directly impact their own research. These journals are helpful spaces for building networks and sparking discussions that accelerate progress in a given field&mdash;but some topics are too big to tackle from within just one discipline or have far-reaching implications beyond a single field of study.</p>



<p>Multidisciplinary journals bring different viewpoints, skillsets and analytical approaches together, encouraging collaboration and conversation amongst research groups and decision-makers working to solve similar challenges. Many of our journals consider multi- or inter- disciplinary research in order to present a robust view of the field and it is a centerpiece of the mission for <em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, </em>and <em>PLOS Water.</em> These journals bridge gaps between related fields, consider social, economic, and behavioral factors that affect these issues, and bring regional perspectives together to address global challenges. By bringing together this work in a single venue, readers get a more holistic view of the topics and challenges in these areas, and how they might inform each other to foster more creative solutions, robust decision-making, or deepen existing knowledge.</p>



<h3>What other aspects of scientific research should be uncovered and preserved?</h3>



<p>Are there more ways PLOS could help to facilitate the sharing of high quality research that would ordinarily remain hidden? Share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">Video shows the first fox known to fish for food</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fox froze. Inches from his paws, frenzied, spawning carp writhed in the shallow water along a reservoir’s shore. In a sudden flash of movement, the fox dove nose-first into the water, emerging with a large carp wriggling in his mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2016, two researchers in Spain watched as a male red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3814?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=R3MR425&amp;utm_content=LifeSciences">stalked and caught 10 carp over a couple of hours</a>. The event, described in a study published August 18 in <em>Ecology</em>, seems to be the first recorded instance of a fox fishing, the researchers say. The discovery makes red foxes just the second type of canid — the group that includes wolves and dogs — known to hunt fish.</p>





<p>“Seeing the fox hunting carp one after another was incredible,” says ecologist Jorge Tobajas of the University of Córdoba. “We have been studying this species for years, but we never expected something like this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tobajas and his colleague Francisco Díaz-Ruiz of the University of Málaga stumbled across the fishing fox while surveying a site for a different project. The fox first caught their attention because it didn’t immediately flee when it spotted the researchers. Seizing the opportunity, Tobajas and Díaz-Ruiz decided to hide nearby and see what the fox was up to.</p>



<p>Their curiosity turned into excitement after the fox caught its first fish. “The most surprising thing was to see how the fox hunted many carp without making any mistakes,” Tobajas says. “This made us realize that it was surely not the first time he had done it.”</p>

</div><figcaption>In March 2016, a male red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) in Spain was spotted grabbing carp during spring spawning season. The event seems to be the first recorded instance of a fox fishing. Foxes and wolves are now the only canids known to fish.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of immediately guzzling down all of the fish, the fox hid most of its catch and appeared to share at least one fish with a female fox, possibly its mate.</p>



<p>Fish remains have been spotted in the scat of foxes before. But scientists weren’t sure whether foxes had caught the fish themselves or were simply scavenging dead fish. This research confirms that some foxes fish for their food, says Thomas Gable, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>“I would be shocked if this was the only fox to have learned how to fish,” Gable says.</p>



<p>Wolves living on the Pacific coast of North America and in Minnesota <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolves-regurgitate-blueberries-pups-diet">are the only other canids known to fish</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/20</em>). The fact that two canid species living on separate continents both fish opens the possibility that the behavior might be more common than previously thought, Gable says.</p>



<p>For Tobajas, the fishing fox is an example of how much scientists still don’t know about the natural world, even for species that live fairly close with humans. “The red fox is a very common species and is in many cases a bit hated,” he says. Foxes sometimes attack pets or livestock and are considered a pest in many places. But “observations like this show us that it a fascinating and very intelligent animal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-sensor-sunlight-environment-magnetic-field">This environmentally friendly quantum sensor runs on sunlight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Quantum tech is going green.</p>



<p>A new take on highly sensitive magnetic field sensors ditches the power-hungry lasers that previous devices have relied on to make their measurements and replaces them with sunlight. Lasers can gobble 100 watts or so of power — like keeping a bright lightbulb burning. The innovation potentially untethers quantum sensors from that energy need. The result is an <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxenergy/accepted/9607cK25D4a18803a7914f5164e2f133eb90a6171">environmentally friendly prototype</a> on the forefront of technology, researchers report in an upcoming issue of <em>Physical Review X Energy</em>.</p>





<p>The big twist is in <em>how</em> the device uses sunlight. It doesn’t use solar cells to convert light into electricity. Instead, the sunlight does the job of the laser’s light, says Jiangfeng Du, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Quantum magnetometers often include a powerful green laser to measure magnetic fields. The laser shines on a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamond-detectors">diamond that contains atomic defects</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/08</em>). The defects result when nitrogen atoms replace some of the carbon atoms that pure diamonds are made of. The green laser causes the nitrogen defects to fluoresce, emitting red light with an intensity that depends on the strength of the surrounding magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The new quantum sensor needs green light too. There’s plenty of that in sunlight, as seen in the green wavelengths reflected from tree leaves and grass. To collect enough of it to run their magnetometer, Du and colleagues replaced the laser with a lens 15 centimeters across to gather sunlight. They then filtered the light to remove all colors but green and focused it on a diamond with nitrogen atom defects. The result is red fluorescence that reveals magnetic field strengths just as laser-equipped magnetometers do.</p>

In this prototype, a lens (top) collects sunlight, which is filtered to leave only green wavelengths of light. That green light provides an environmentally friendly alternative to the light created by power-hungry lasers that conventional quantum devices rely on.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117242">Yunbin Zhu/University of Science and Technology of China</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Changing energy from one type to another, as happens <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">when solar cells collect light and produce electricity</a>, is an inherently inefficient process (<em>SN: 7/26/17</em>). The researchers claim that avoiding the conversion of sunlight to electricity to run lasers makes their approach three times more efficient than would be possible with solar cells powering lasers.</p>



<p>“I’ve never seen any other reports that connect solar research to quantum technologies,” says Yen-Hung Lin, a physicist at the University of Oxford who was not involved with the study. “It might well ignite a spark of interest in this unexplored direction, and we could see more interdisciplinary research in the field of energy.”</p>



<p>Quantum devices sensitive to other things, like electric fields or pressure, could also benefit from the sunlight-driven approach, the researchers say. In particular, space-based quantum technology might use the intense sunlight available outside Earth’s atmosphere to provide light tailored for quantum sensors. The remaining light, in wavelengths that the quantum sensors don’t use, could be relegated to solar cells that power electronics to process the quantum signals.</p>



<p>The sunlight-driven magnetometer is just a first step in the melding of quantum and environmentally sustainable technology. “In the current state, this device is primarily for developmental purposes,” Du says. “We expect that the devices will be used for practical purposes. But there [is] lots of work to be done.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-honeybee-shimmering-nest-behavior-defense">Here’s what triggers giant honeybees to do the wave</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant honeybees send waves rippling across their open nests by flipping their abdomens upward in coordination, a sight that approaching predators seem to shy away from. A new study is revealing details about what triggers the behavior, known as shimmering.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">That <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/225/17/jeb244716/276503/Defensive-shimmering-responses-in-Apis-dorsata-are">shimmering is strongest</a> when the bees are shown a dark object that moves against a light background under bright ambient light, researchers report in the September <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. The experimental setup simulates animals such as hornets, one of the bees’ main predators, flying against the bright sky, and shows what visual cues set off the behavior, the researchers say.</p>





<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">The behavior “is intriguing as this is possibly one way in which a species of animal communicates with another to warn that they are capable of defending themselves,” says Kavitha Kannan, a neurobiologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Giant honeybees, including <em>Apis dorsata</em>, typically form open nests uncovered by other materials in areas like tree branches and window ledges. In the new study, the researchers worked with two <em>A. dorsata </em>nests in roof rafters. Standing near the hives, behavioral ecologist Sajesh Vijayan moved circular cardboard pieces of different sizes in shades of gray and black against either a gray or a black background. The bees shimmered when a black object moved against the gray backdrop, but not when the contrast was flipped.</p>



<p>That’s probably because the black-on-gray setup “resembles a natural predator or a natural condition,” says Sajesh, who goes by his first name, as is common in many parts of southern India. “These are open-nesting colonies, so they are always exposed to a bright sky.”</p>



<p>The team observed little shimmering during the dim twilight periods of dawn and dusk. Since shimmering is a response meant to be perceived by a predator or other unwelcome visitor, such as a bee from another colony, the researchers think that other defensive behaviors might be at play during dim conditions.</p>

</div><figcaption>Giant honeybees, including <em>Apis dorsata </em>(shown), send waves cascading across their open nests by flipping their abdomens upward in a coordinated motion. The behavior seems to deter bee predators such as hornets.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“We also think that shimmering is a specialized response towards hornets because it has not really been reported in cases of birds attacking or birds flying past these colonies,” Sajesh says. Birds, instead, “elicit a mass stinging response.” That could be because approaching birds loom comparatively large in the bees’ visual field, and at that point, the bees’ attitude may be “let&#8217;s not take any more chances, just sting,” Sajesh says.</p>



<p>In both hives, shimmering completely vanished when the bees were presented with the smallest objects, in this case a circle four centimeters in diameter. The result suggests that there is a minimum size threshold that triggers the ripples.</p>



<p>Shimmering strength did not wane even when the bees were exposed to the artificial setup repeatedly, perhaps because it’s advantageous to stay vigilant against predators like hornets that make persistent attacks.</p>



<p>How exactly the bees are perceiving the objects in the study is not yet known. “They could be actually seeing this object moving, or they could just be responding to a reduction in their visual field,” Sajesh says.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to explore that question further. They are also designing experiments with LED screens to tweak the background colors and patterns and object shapes to figure out what types of shapes and even motions might matter to the bees.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lupus-car-t-cell-therapy-remission-autoimmune-disease">5 people with lupus are in remission after CAR-T cell treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>After receiving an experimental treatment to stop the body from attacking itself, five people no longer have any symptoms of lupus.</p>



<p>That treatment, called CAR-T cell therapy, seems to have reset the patients’ immune systems, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02017-5">sending their autoimmune disease into remission</a>, researchers report September 15 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. It’s not yet clear how long the relief will last or whether the therapy will work for all patients.</p>



<p>Even so, the results could be “revolutionary,” says immunologist Linrong Lu of the Shanghai Immune Therapy Institute at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">CAR-T cell therapy</a> has been used for various types of cancer, but it’s still in testing for autoimmune diseases (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, all five participants went into remission without needing additional drugs beyond the genetically engineered CAR-T cells. The target of those engineered cells — immune cells key for fighting off infections — returned a few months after being wiped out. Some of those cells are primed to attack viruses and bacteria but not the study participants’ healthy cells.</p>



<p>It’s unknown how many people worldwide have lupus, a painful disease in which some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lack-circular-rna-may-trigger-lupus">immune proteins called antibodies attack healthy tissue and organs</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/19</em>). An estimated 161,000 to 322,000 people in the United States live with the most common form called systemic lupus erythematosus. While there are effective therapies, those treatments don’t work for everyone.</p>



<p>The five people in the study had this common form with symptoms resistant to multiple commonly used lupus drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine. But laboratory studies in mice hinted that CAR-T cells might help. So immunologist Georg Schett and colleagues took T cells from each patient and genetically modified the cells to track down and kill all antibody-producing cells. All five participants — four female and one male ages 18 to 24 — were in remission three months after being treated with the altered cells.</p>



<p>The antibody-producing cells, called B cells, disappeared from blood samples as the CAR-T cells killed them off. But B cells are an important defense against infectious diseases such as measles. Luckily, the immune cells weren’t gone permanently, says Schett, of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. A few months later, the patients’ bone marrow had made more. The B cells were back; the lupus was not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Which means, in a way, that we have a reset of the immune system in these young individuals,” Schett says.</p>



<p>Typically, the immune system has checkpoints that eliminate cells that attack the body instead of a foreign invader. Autoimmune diseases such as lupus occur when these cells that recognize and attack “self” escape scrutiny. For lupus to come back, Schett says, the same mistake may need to happen twice. “So far we think the disease is gone.”</p>



<p>To know for sure, the team needs more time to follow the participants. In August 2021, the researchers reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that the first treated participant, a 20-year-old woman, was <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2107725">in remission three months after receiving the drug</a>. Now, that patient has been healthy for a year and a half, Schett says. The other four have been healthy for six months to a year. Time will tell how long these people will stay lupus-free.</p>



<p>Which people might benefit most from CAR-T cell therapy is not yet clear either. Lupus symptoms and severity vary from person to person. The treatment could, for instance, be most useful for patients who are in earlier stages of the disease before it becomes too severe, Lu says. Still, if future clinical trials prove effective, CAR-T cell therapy could be another way to offer hope to patients with the disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/linkedin-job-search-weak-ties-relatiosnhips-social-science">Looking for a job? Lean more on weak ties than strong relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>The key to landing your dream job could be connecting with and then sending a single message to a casual acquaintance on social media<em>.</em></p>



<p>That’s the conclusion of a five-year study of over 20 million users on the professional networking site LinkedIn, researchers report in the Sept. 16 <em>Science</em>. The study is the first large-scale effort to experimentally test a nearly 50-year-old social science theory that says <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476">weak social ties</a> matter more than strong ones for getting ahead in life, including finding a good job. &nbsp;</p>





<p>“The weak tie theory is one of the most celebrated and cited findings in social science,” says network scientist Dashun Wang of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who coauthored <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add0692">a perspective piece</a> in the same issue of <em>Science</em>. This study “provides the first causal evidence for this idea of weak ties explaining job mobility.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sociologist Mark Granovetter of Stanford University <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392">proposed the weak tie theory in 1973</a>. The theory, which has garnered nearly 67,000 scientific citations, hinges on the idea that humans cluster into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/small-world-after-all-short-e-mail-chains-reach-targets-worldwide">social spheres that connect via bridges</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/03</em>). Those bridges represent weak social ties between people, and give individuals who cross access to realms of new ideas and information, including about job markets.</p>



<p>But the influential theory has come under fire in recent years. In particular, a 2017 analysis in the <em>Journal of Labor Economics</em> of 6 million Facebook users showed that increasing interaction with a friend online, thereby strengthening that social tie, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/686225?casa_token=YB7H0F62oUcAAAAA:iS6QL08MfGU0Z9n5yjsICGWIsV40G5JKt0ELCkiyjNXl64eR2uuBd1Jqh7S0fKDXHxpp42No2w">increased the likelihood of working with that friend</a>.</p>



<p>In the new study, LinkedIn gave Sinan Aral, a managerial economist at MIT, and his team access to data from the company’s People You May Know algorithm, which recommends new connections to users. Over five years, the social media site’s operators used seven variations of the algorithm for users actively seeking connections, each recommending varying levels of weak and strong ties to users. During that time, 2 billion new ties and 600,000 job changes were noted on the site. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Aral and his colleagues measured tie strength via the number of mutual LinkedIn connections and direct messages between users. Job transitions occurred when two criteria were met: A pair connected on LinkedIn at least one year prior to the job seeker joining the same company as the other user; and the user who first joined the company was there for at least a year before the second user came onboard. Those criteria were meant in part to weed out situations where the two could have ended up at the same company by chance.</p>

<p>Overall, weak ties were more likely to lead to job changes than strong ones, the team found. But the study adds a twist to the theory: When job hunting, mid-tier friends are more helpful than either one’s closest friends or near strangers. Those are the friends with whom you share roughly 10 connections and seldom interact, Aral says. “They’re still weak ties, but they are not the weakest ties.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that when a user added more weak ties to their network, that person applied to more jobs overall, which converted to getting more jobs. But that finding applied only to highly digitized jobs, such as those heavily reliant on software and amenable to remote work. Strong ties were more beneficial than weak ties for some job seekers outside the digital realm. Aral suspects those sorts of jobs may be more local and thus reliant on members of tight-knit communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding that job seekers should lean on mid-level acquaintances corroborates smaller studies, says network scientist Cameron Piercy of the University of Kansas in Lawrence who wasn’t involved in either the 2017 study or this more recent one.</p>



<p>That evidence suggests that the weakest acquaintances lack enough information about the job candidate, while the closest friends know too much about the candidate’s strengths — and flaws. “There’s this medium-ties sweet spot where you are willing to vouch for them because they know a couple people that you know,” Piercy says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But he and others also raise ethical concerns about the new study. Piercy worries about research that manipulates people’s social media spaces without clearly and obviously indicating that it’s being done. In the new study, LinkedIn users who visited the “My Network” page for connection recommendations — who make up less than 5 percent of the site’s monthly active users — got automatically triggered into the experiment.</p>



<p>And it’s unclear how LinkedIn, whose researchers are coauthors of the study, will use this information moving forward. “When you are talking about people’s work, their ability to make money, this is important,” Piercy says. The company “should recommend weak ties, the version of the algorithm that led to more job attainment, if its purpose is to connect people with work. But they don’t make that conclusion in the paper.”</p>



<p>Another limitation is that the analyzed data lacked vital demographic information on users. That was for privacy reasons, the researchers say. But breaking down the results by gender is crucial as some evidence suggests that women — but not men — must rely on both weak and strong ties for professional advancement, Northwestern’s Wang says.</p>



<p>Still, with over half of jobs generally found through social ties, the findings could point people toward better ways to hunt for a job in today’s tumultuous environment. “You may have seen these recommendations on LinkedIn and you may have ignored them. You think ‘Oh, I don’t really know that person,’” Aral says. “But you may be doing yourself a disservice.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/destroyed-moon-chrysalis-caused-saturns-rings">Saturn’s rings and tilt might have come from one missing moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>A single, doomed moon could clear up a couple of mysteries about Saturn.</p>



<p>This hypothetical missing moon, dubbed Chrysalis, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq3184">could have helped tilt Saturn over</a>, researchers suggest September 15 in <em>Science</em>. The ensuing orbital chaos might then have led to the moon’s demise, shredding it to form the iconic rings that encircle the planet today.</p>



<p>“We like it because it’s a scenario that explains two or three different things that were previously not thought to be related,” says study coauthor Jack Wisdom, a planetary scientist at MIT. “The rings are related to the tilt, who would ever have guessed that?”</p>





<p>Saturn’s rings <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-age-young-moons">appear surprisingly young</a>, a mere 150 million years or so old (<em>SN: 12/14/17</em>). If the dinosaurs had telescopes, they might have seen a ringless Saturn.&nbsp; Another mysterious feature of the gas giant is its nearly 27-degree tilt relative to its orbit around the sun. That tilt is too large to have formed when Saturn did or to be the result of collisions knocking the planet over.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How a missing satellite formed Saturn’s tilt and its rings</h3>



<p>When Saturn formed, its spin axis was probably close to straight up and down (1). But as the moon Titan moved away from Saturn, interactions between Titan, another moon called Chrysalis and the planet Neptune could have helped tilt Saturn over by 36 degrees (2). Chaos ensued, leading to the destruction of Chrysalis. The shredded moon formed Saturn’s rings, and its loss let Saturn’s tilt angle relax a bit to its present-day value of about 27 degrees (3).</p>

<p>Planetary scientists have long suspected that the tilt is related to Neptune, because of a coincidence in timing between the way the two planets move. Saturn’s axis wobbles, or precesses, like a spinning top. Neptune’s entire orbit around the sun also wobbles, like a struggling hula hoop.</p>



<p>The periods of both precessions are almost the same, a phenomenon known as resonance. Scientists theorized that gravity from Saturn’s moons — especially the largest moon, Titan — helped the planetary precessions line up. But some features of Saturn’s internal structure were not known well enough to prove that the two timings were related.</p>



<p>Wisdom and colleagues used precision measurements of Saturn’s gravitational field from the Cassini spacecraft, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rip-cassini-saturn-nasa">plunged into Saturn</a> in 2017 after 13 years orbiting the gas giant, to figure out the details of its internal structure (<em>SN: 9/15/17</em>). Specifically, the team worked out Saturn’s moment of inertia, a measure of how much force is needed to tip the planet over. The team found that the moment of inertia is close to, but not exactly, what it would be if Saturn’s spin were in perfect resonance with Neptune’s orbit.</p>



<p>“We argue that it’s so close, it couldn’t have occurred by chance,” Wisdom says. “That’s where this satellite Chrysalis came in.”</p>



<p>After considering a volley of other explanations, Wisdom and colleagues realized that another smallish moon would have helped Titan bring Saturn and Neptune into resonance by adding its own gravitational tugs. Titan drifted away from Saturn until its orbit synced up with that of Chrysalis. The enhanced gravitational kicks from the larger moon sent the doomed smaller moon on a chaotic dance. Eventually, Chrysalis swooped so close to Saturn that it grazed the giant planet’s cloud tops. Saturn ripped the moon apart, and slowly ground its pieces down into the rings.</p>



<p>Calculations and computer simulations showed that the scenario works, though not all the time. Out of 390 simulated scenarios, only 17 ended with Chrysalis disintegrating to create the rings. Then again, massive, striking rings like Saturn’s are rare, too.</p>



<p>The name Chrysalis came from that spectacular ending: “A chrysalis is a cocoon of a butterfly,” Wisdom says. “The satellite Chrysalis was dormant for 4.5 billion years, presumably. Then suddenly the rings of Saturn emerged from it.”</p>



<p>The story hangs together, says planetary scientist Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the new work. But he’s not entirely convinced. “I think it’s all plausible, but maybe not so likely,” he says. “If Sherlock Holmes is solving a case, even the improbable explanation may be the right one. But I don’t think we’re there yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polio-cdc-spread-new-york-vaccine-virus">Poliovirus is spreading in New York. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>A particular kind of poliovirus is spreading in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that the country now <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0913-polio.html">joins a list of around 30 other countries </a>where circulation of the virus has been identified. Those countries include the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, Yemen and around two dozen in Africa.</p>



<p>The news, announced September 13, comes after the identification in July of a case of paralytic polio in an unvaccinated adult in Rockland County in New York. Public health officials found the case was caused by what’s called a vaccine-derived poliovirus (find out more about this kind of poliovirus below). This spurred wastewater surveillance in Rockland and the surrounding counties, because people shed poliovirus in their stool. The wastewater samples showed<a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2022/2022-09-09_polio_immunization.htm"> that the virus was spreading in Rockland and neighboring areas</a>.</p>





<p>In response, New York Governor Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-order/no-21-declaring-disaster-state-new-york">declared a state of emergency</a> on September 9 to expand access to polio vaccination statewide. Three of the counties where poliovirus has been detected in wastewater — Rockland, Orange and Sullivan — have polio vaccination rates of only around 60 percent. The virus has also turned up in New York City and Nassau County.</p>



<p>While most people infected with polio don’t have symptoms, some might feel like they have the flu, with fever, fatigue or a sore throat. In rare cases, the virus can cause permanent paralysis, and the disease can turn deadly if that paralysis hits the muscles that control breathing or swallowing. Anyone unvaccinated is at risk of paralytic polio if they get infected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Widespread vaccination efforts helped <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-polio-still-circulating-united-states">eliminate wild polioviruses from the United States</a> in 1979, but public health officials are still working toward eradicating the disease globally (<em>SN: 9/12/19</em>). The new worries about polio in the United States are driven by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html">vaccine-derived versions of the virus spreading in areas with low vaccination</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are six things to know about polio right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>There are two types of polio vaccines. What’s the difference?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Polio vaccines come as a shot, given in the arm or leg, or a liquid given orally. These vaccines provide protection against wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived poliovirus. Both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic#vaccine-victories">polio vaccines used to be given in the United States,</a> but since 2000, the shot has been the only polio vaccine available in the country (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>).</p>



<p>The shot is an inactivated vaccine given as part of routine childhood vaccinations in the United States. It is made using poliovirus that has been “killed,” stripped of its ability to cause disease. Kids receive a total of four shots. The inactivated vaccine protects against paralysis.</p>



<p>The oral vaccine, still used in many countries, is an attenuated vaccine, made with live but weakened poliovirus. This vaccine can help prevent wild poliovirus from being passed along further if a vaccinated person drinks water or eats food that has been contaminated with stool containing the pathogen. That means <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-polio-vaccine-eradicate-paralyzing-disease-outbreaks">it can prevent the spread of poliovirus in a community</a> while also protecting against paralysis (<em>SN: 1/8/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because these attenuated versions can replicate, the virus can spread from cell to cell and possibly to other people. Which leads us to the next question.</p>



<h4>What are vaccine-derived polioviruses?</h4>



<p>These viruses are related to the oral vaccine. Since the viruses used in the vaccine can replicate, they can spread but they’re too weakened to cause serious disease. The problem comes when an attenuated virus from the oral vaccine spreads among too many people and regains its ability to cause paralysis, says Adam Lauring, a virologist and infectious diseases physician at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “Because it can replicate, it will evolve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a community with low or no vaccination against polio, such vaccine-derived polioviruses can cause disease. </p>



<h4>So why do some countries still use the oral vaccine?</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://polioeradication.org/">Global Polio Eradication Initiative</a>, which includes the World Health Organization, CDC, United Nations Children’s Fund and other groups, has been working since 1988 to eradicate polio. The oral vaccine has been a key tool for global efforts to get rid of polio, Lauring says. That’s not only because that vaccine is inexpensive and easy to use in low- and middle-income countries, but also because studies suggest it better protects the gut, the part of the body where the virus grows. The more protected the gut, the better the chances of reducing transmission and stopping an outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What does it mean that poliovirus is being detected in wastewater?</h4>



<p>It’s a sign that poliovirus is spreading among people in those regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paralysis from poliovirus is rare — affecting around 1 out of 200 infected people. So the single paralytic case identified in July in New York was already a hint that there may have been hundreds of other infections. The virus has since been detected in <a href="https://health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/wastewater.htm">wastewater samples from as early as May</a>. The virus’s continued presence in wastewater suggests people are still getting infected and passing it on to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Should unvaccinated people get vaccinated?</h4>



<p>Yes. “If you don’t know if you received polio shots, then you should probably get your polio shots,” Lauring says. “If you didn’t [get vaccinated], you should get a polio shot.”</p>



<p>Vaccine-derived polioviruses are largely a problem in communities where not enough people are vaccinated. “That’s one piece of the puzzle of what’s been going on in New York,” Lauring says. Low immunization rates mean vaccine-derived viruses can spread, largely among unvaccinated people, and circulate silently before someone gets sick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Places that have sanitation issues or struggle with other intestinal diseases are also hot spots for vaccine-derived polioviruses. When there’s not enough immunity to stop poliovirus from circulating, the virus can evolve further.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What about people who got vaccinated as kids?</h4>



<p>People who got vaccinated, even decades ago, are likely still protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adults who have a high risk of exposure to the virus <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html#types-of-polio">are eligible for one lifetime booster</a> shot, according to the CDC. Otherwise, people should make sure they received all the recommended doses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unknown exactly how durable childhood polio vaccines are at protecting against severe disease in adults. With little polio circulating around the world, it’s a hard question to study, Lauring says. Still, for years there haven’t been any cases of polio in the United States, and we’ve largely had immunity from the inactivated vaccine, he says. “I’m not sounding the alarm bells.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-animal-husbandry-dung-fuel-fire-syria-stone-age">Humans may have started tending animals almost 13,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunter-gatherer groups living in southwest Asia may have started keeping and caring for animals nearly 13,000 years ago — roughly 2,000 years earlier than previously thought.</p>



<p>Ancient plant samples extracted from present-day Syria <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272947">show hints of charred dung</a>, indicating that people were burning animal droppings by the end of the Old Stone Age, researchers report September 14 in <em>PLOS One</em>. The findings suggest humans were using the dung as fuel and may have started animal tending during or even before the transition to agriculture. But what animals produced the dung and the exact nature of the animal-human relationship remain unclear.</p>





<p>“We know today that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-migration-fueled-dung">dung fuel is a valuable resource</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t really been documented prior to the Neolithic,” says Alexia Smith, an archaeobotanist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs (<em>SN: 8/5/03</em>).</p>



<p>Smith and her colleagues reexamined 43 plant samples taken in the 1970s from a residential dwelling at Abu Hureyra, an archaeological site now lost under the Tabqa Dam reservoir. The samples date from roughly 13,300 to 7,800 years ago, spanning the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to farming and herding.</p>



<p>Throughout the samples, the researchers found varying amounts of spherulites, tiny crystals that form in the intestines of animals and are deposited in dung. There was a noticeable uptick between 12,800 and 12,300 years ago, when darkened spherulites also appeared in a fire pit — evidence they were heated to between 500⁰ and 700⁰ Celsius, and probably burned.</p>



<p>The team then cross-referenced these findings against previously published data from Abu Hureyra. It found that the dung burning coincided with a shift from circular to linear buildings, an indication of a more sedentary lifestyle, along with steadily rising numbers of wild sheep at the site and a decline in gazelle and other small game. Combined, the authors argue, these findings suggest humans may have started tending animals outside their homes and were burning the piles of dung at hand as a supplement to wood.</p>



<p>“The spherulite evidence reported here confirms that dung of some sort was used as fuel,” says Naomi Miller, an archaeobotanist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Figuring out what animal left the dung could reveal whether animals were tethered outside or not. While the authors propose wild sheep, which would have been more accommodating to capture, Miller suggests the source was probably roaming wild gazelle.</p>



<p>“Spherulites coming from off-site collection of gazelle dung, stored until burned as fuel, is to my mind a more plausible interpretation,” Miller says. Even if kept for a few days, she says, sheep wouldn’t produce large amounts of dung.</p>



<p>“The whole thing is a classic whodunit,” says anthropologist Melinda Zeder, something <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">perhaps DNA analysis could solve</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>). Gazelle might be the source, she says, and if captured young, the animals may have even been tended for a while — even if they weren’t eventually domesticated.</p>



<p>“The interesting thing is that people [were] experimenting with their environment,” says Zeder, of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. “Domestication is almost incidental to that.”</p>

<h2>Why now?</h2>



<p>PLOS has been a proponent of Open Science practices since its inception, with landmark initiatives such as the introduction of an enhanced data availability policy in 2014. Our data availability policy and consistent use of Data Availability Statements in publications help ensure that data supporting publications are shared in some form. More recently, we&rsquo;ve been focused on how we can <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">increase adoption of </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/"><em>best practices</em></a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/"> in data sharing</a> &ndash; use of data repositories. We&rsquo;ve used information from published articles to understand which methods of data sharing researchers use when publishing with PLOS, and to find potential solutions to support improvements in practice. The focus on improvement is important &ndash; we are not aiming to audit publications for compliance reasons but to understand how we can facilitate best practice and support research.</p>



<p>Since 2020, we have established a renewed programme of activity &ndash; an Open Research Solutions programme &ndash; with the<em> goal of measurably increasing adoption of multiple Open Science practices</em>. The introduction of new solutions for sharing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">protocols</a>, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/supporting-community-needs-with-an-enhanced-code-policy-on-plos-computational-biology/">code</a>, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">research data</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">preprints</a> is intended to support this goal.</p>



<p>As a prerequisite to achieving this goal, we need to better understand the needs and practices of the researchers we serve. This, more specifically, means we need to regularly investigate:</p>



<ul><li>What are levels and trends in adoption of Open Science practices?</li><li>What is the potential for adoption of Open Science practices?</li><li>What is the impact of solutions we co-create with communities?</li><li>How do Open Science practices vary between disciplines and regions (and why)?</li><li>What are the barriers to adoption and what solutions could support adoption?</li></ul>



<p>And we need to answer these questions in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">increasingly diverse communities</a>; for increasingly diverse research outputs; and across increasing amounts of content. Measurement of Open Science practices at scale cannot be done manually. To this end, earlier this year, we shared the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">results of a successful pilot with DataSeer</a> to measure rates of code sharing at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>. As well as demonstrating the effectiveness of the journal&rsquo;s mandatory code-sharing policy at increasing availability of code, this pilot also demonstrated the effectiveness of a DataSeer&rsquo;s natural language processing and artificial intelligence-driven technology at assessing Open Science practices efficiently in PLOS content.</p>



<h2><a></a>Plan to deliver Open Science Indicators with DataSeer</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve extended our partnership with DataSeer, who are helping to create and deliver an initial suite of <strong>three <u>Open Science Indicators, </u>which will help understand how open science is practiced across all PLOS content from 2019 onwards (&gt;66,000 articles)</strong>. Starting later in 2022, we&rsquo;ll share for all PLOS research articles information on 3 indicators of best practice in Open Science, which are largely optional in PLOS journals:<br><br></p>



<ol type="1"><li>Rates of data sharing in data repositories</li><li>Rates of code sharing</li><li>Rates of preprint posting, in any preprint server before publication</li></ol>



<p>A mock-up of these Open Science Indicators is shown in Figure 1 (these are preliminary results subject to change).</p>



<p>Having collaborated with DataSeer to adapt their technology to measure code sharing, they are now developing the capability to detect PLOS articles previously posted as preprints. While PLOS has <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">a solid understanding of the usage of integrated preprint servers</a> &ndash; bioRxiv and medRxiv &ndash; we have a less complete picture of usage of other preprint servers. As our portfolio expands to new research communities, in particular outside of biology and medicine, we need to support more researchers in other fields.</p>



<p><br><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: <em>Mock-up showing rates of code sharing and rates of data sharing in repositories detected in PLOS articles 2019-2022; and a work-progress estimate of preprint posting</em></em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="709" height="439" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Chart-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20757" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Chart-2.png 709w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Chart-2-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px"></figure>



<p>And we&rsquo;re not stopping at PLOS content. We also need to understand how these indicators compare to relevant content <em>outside of PLOS</em>. As such, our approach will involve assessing the same Open Science Indicators in a topic-matched, randomized sample of Open Access articles from PubMed Central. The greater understanding we have of the adoption of Open Science across disciplines and communities over time, the more knowledge we have to inform the co-creation of solutions that support researcher needs &ndash; and the practice of Open Science.</p>



<h2><a></a>Plan for further engagement</h2>



<p>We will be the first publisher to transparently share Open Science Indicators in this way, and to do so repeatedly &ndash; the Indicators will be updated regularly after launch to offer trends over time. Open Science practices have of course been assessed by researchers before. Examples include the seminal work of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107">Serghiou <em>et al</em></a> who assessed transparency indicators across all of PubMed Central, offering a comprehensive snapshot of multiple open practices up until 2020. We are also inspired by the work at BIH Quest on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://s-quest.bihealth.org/charite-dashboard/#tabStart" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Charit&eacute; Metrics dashboard</a>. And we applaud the work of the growing community of <a href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/quest/service/automated-screening-tools">tool developers</a>, <a href="https://www.orfg.org/news/2022/6/16/orfg-issues-community-call-to-improve-research-output-tracking">policy makers</a> and <a href="https://www.scholcommlab.ca/2022/03/02/turning-policy-into-practice-the-biomedical-research-open-science-dashboard-project/">researchers</a> involved in better understanding Open Science practices. Indeed, community alignment on if and how we can measure Open Science practices will be essential to long term progress.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve outlined, above, PLOS&rsquo; motivations for measuring Open Science Indicators but we know <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9/">from our own research</a> that many institutions and funders also want to better understand the extent to which Open Science is being practiced. These stakeholders lack effective solutions and/ or resources needed to do this effectively. While we can&rsquo;t claim to solve these problems with Open Science Indicators on PLOS articles alone, we will make our data accessible openly to inform further work in this area.</p>



<p>There are of course caveats with the measurement of anything (&ldquo;<em>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure</em>&rdquo; &ndash; Goodhart&rsquo;s Law). Importantly, what we are<em> not doing</em> is creating new &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; or &ldquo;rankings&rdquo; &ndash; of journals, individuals, funders or institutions. Open Science Indicators are just that &ndash; <em>indications</em> of Open Science practices. But, when combined with qualitative insights and other responsibly-used metrics, Open Science Indicators could help provide a more complete understanding of the impact and credibility of research. This is highlighted by numerous initiatives &ndash; such as at the <a href="https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/reforming-research-assessment-agreement-now-final-2022-07-20_en">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/natural-sciences/open-science/implementation#open-science-working-groups">UNESCO</a>, <a href="https://www.heliosopen.org/">HELIOS</a>, <a href="https://www.clacso.org/en/folec/">FOLEC</a>, and <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> &ndash; that have goals to better recognise Open Science practices in how research is assessed. To date, for understanding Open Science behaviors, we tend to only hear facts that are about specific journals, or critiques of a <em>lack of</em> an activity. We see an opportunity for these Indicators is to neutrally measure such activities wherever they are happening and reward the activity.</p>



<h2><a></a>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;re currently preparing the first major release of the data for later in 2022. The data will, naturally, be available for reuse under an open license and we&rsquo;ll be sharing insights from the data with editors who lead our journals in advance of public release.</p>



<p>After the first data release, the indicators for research data, code and preprints will be updated regularly as new PLOS content is published. We will also be developing, in partnership with DataSeer, additional Open Science Indicators. Sharing detailed methods information, in the form of protocols, is another Open Science practice we have been focused on of late, and creating an appropriate indicator for this practice is next in our roadmap.</p>



<p>How we develop our approach to presenting and sharing the data for external users will be driven by what we learn from community feedback in the build up to and after the first release. As we&rsquo;ve noted, the insights from Open Science Indicators are already highly valuable to PLOS, and we&rsquo;ll be sharing the data publicly to present researchers, policy makers, institutions and other publishers with reliable information about Open Science practices. We hope this will empower them to make more informed decisions about their own policies and practices &ndash; and stimulate collaborations. With better <em>quantitative</em>, observationalinformation about Open Science practices, coupled with the growing body of attitudinal data from surveys, we see potential for a more evidence-based understanding of the opportunities and challenges of making Open Science practices the norm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">Falling objects in orbit show Einstein was right — again</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gravity doesn’t discriminate. An experiment in orbit has confirmed, with precision a hundred times greater than previous efforts, that everything falls the same way under the influence of gravity.</p>



<p>The finding is the most stringent test yet of the equivalence principle, a key tenet of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The principle holds <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.121102">to about one part in a thousand trillion</a>, researchers report September 14 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>The idea that gravity affects all things equally might not seem surprising. But the slightest hint otherwise could help explain how general relativity, the foundational theory of gravity, meshes with the standard model of particle physics, the theoretical framework that describes all fundamental particles of matter. General relativity is a classical theory that sees the universe as smooth and continuous, whereas the standard model is a quantum theory involving grainy bits of matter and energy. Combining them into a single theory of everything has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-theory-history-reality-uncertainty-physics">an unfulfilled dream of scientists extending back to Einstein</a> (<em>SN:</em><em> </em><em>1/12/22</em>).</p>





<p>“The equivalence principle is the most important cornerstone of Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity,” says Sabine Hossenfelder, a physicist with the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies in Germany who was not involved in the study.&nbsp; “We know [it] eventually has to be altered because it cannot in its present form take into account quantum effects.”</p>



<p>To help search for potential alterations, the MICROSCOPE experiment tracked the motion of nested metal cylinders — a 300-gram titanium outer cylinder and a 402-gram platinum inner one — as they orbited the Earth in near-perfect free fall. Any difference in the effect of gravity on the respective cylinders would cause them to move relative to each other. Small electrical forces applied to bring the cylinders back into alignment would have revealed a potential violation of the equivalence principle.</p>



<p>From April 2016 to October 2018, the cylinders were shielded inside a satellite that protected them from the buffeting of solar winds, the minuscule pressure that sunlight exerts and the residual atmosphere at an orbital altitude of a little over 700 kilometers high.</p>



<p>By performing the experiment in orbit, the researchers could compare the free fall of two different materials for extended periods without the confounding effects of vibrations or of objects nearby that could exert gravitational forces, says Manuel Rodrigues, a MICROSCOPE team member and physicist with the French aerospace lab ONERA in Palaiseau. “One of the lessons learned by MICROSCOPE is … that space is the best way to get an important improvement in the accuracy for this kind of test.”</p>



<p>Over its two-and-a-half-year mission, MICROSCOPE found no sign of cracks in the equivalence principle, the new study reports. The finding builds on a previous interim report from the experiment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-galileo-gravity-experiment-re-created-space-einstein">that found the same thing</a>, but with less precision (<em>SN: 12/4/17</em>).</p>



<p>Some physicists suspect that limits to the equivalence principle may never turn up in experiments, and that Einstein will perpetually be proven right.</p>



<p>Even 100 times greater precision from a follow-up MICROSCOPE 2 mission, tentatively planned for the 2030s, is unlikely to reveal an equivalence principle breakdown, says Clifford Will, a physicist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who is not affiliated with the experiment. “It really is still this basic idea that Einstein taught,” he says. What we see as the force of gravity is actually the curvature of spacetime. “Any body simply moves along the path in Earth’s spacetime,” whether it’s made of dense platinum, lighter titanium or any other material.</p>



<p>But even if physicists never prove Einstein wrong, Hossenfelder says, experiments like MICROSCOPE are still important. “These tests aren’t just about the equivalence principle,” she says. “They implicitly look for all other kinds of deviations, new forces and so on,” that aren’t part of general relativity. “So really it&#8217;s a multiple-purpose, high-precision measurement.”</p>



<p>Now that the mission is complete, the MICROSCOPE satellite will slowly spiral out of orbit. “It’s difficult to bet where in 25 years it will fall down,” Rodrigues says. Along with a reference set of platinum cylinders on board, “it’s [a] couple of millions of euros [in] platinum.” Where that precious platinum metal will land is anyone’s guess, but the gravity that pulls it down will tug on the titanium just as hard, to one part in a thousand trillion at least.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">How Kenyans help themselves and the planet by saving mangrove trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the fringe of Kenya’s Gazi village, 50 kilometers south of Mombasa, Mwatime Hamadi walks barefoot on a path of scorching-hot sand toward a thicket of trees that seem to float where the land meets the Indian Ocean. Behind her moves village life: Mothers carry babies on their backs while they hang laundry between palm trees, women sweep the floors of huts thatched with palm fronds and old men chat idly about bygone days under the shade of mango trees.</p>



<p>Hamadi is on her way to Gazi Forest, a dense patch of mangroves along Gazi Bay that coastal residents see as vital to their future. Mangroves “play a crucial role in safeguarding the marine ecosystem, which in turn is important for fisheries we depend on for our livelihood,” she says as she reaches a boardwalk that snakes through the coastal wetland.</p>





<p>Hamadi is a tour guide with Gazi Ecotourism Ventures, a group dedicated to empowering women and their community through mangrove conservation. This group is part of a larger carbon offset project called <a href="https://www.mikokopamoja.org/">Mikoko Pamoja</a> that has taken root and is now being copied farther south on Kenya’s coastline and in Mozambique and Madagascar.</p>



<p>Through Mikoko Pamoja, residents of Gazi and nearby Makongeni are cultivating an economic ecosystem that relies on efforts to preserve and restore the mangrove forests. Revenue from carbon credits sold plus the money Hamadi and others earn from ecotourism are split between salaries, project costs and village improvements to health care, sanitation, schools and more.</p>



<p>Mikoko Pamoja, launched in 2013, is the <a href="https://aces-org.co.uk/mikoko-pamoja-project/">world’s first mangrove­-driven carbon credit initiative</a>. It earned the <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/news/equator-prize-2017-winners-announced/">United Nations’ Equator Prize in 2017</a>, awarded for innovative solutions to poverty that involve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.</p>



<p>“The mangrove vegetation was a thriving, healthy ecosystem in precolonial times,” says Ismail Barua, Mikoko Pamoja’s chairperson. During British rule, which stretched from the 1890s to 1963, the colonial government issued licenses to private companies to export mangrove wood. They did this without community involvement, which led to poaching of trees. Even after Kenya gained independence, mangroves were an important source of timber and fuel for industrial processes, main drivers of extensive destruction of the forests.</p>



<p>Today, mangrove restoration is helping the region enter a new chapter, one where labor and resources are well-managed by local communities instead of being exploited. “The community is now able to run its own affairs,” Barua notes. Through innovative solutions and hard work, he says, “we’re trying to bring back a semblance of that ecosystem.”</p>

<h4>A fragile carbon sponge</h4>



<p>The dominant mangrove species in Gazi Forest is <em>Rhizophora murcronata</em>. With oval, leathery leaves about the size of a child’s palm and spindly branches that reach to the sun, the trees can grow up to 27 meters tall. Their interlaced roots, which grow from the base of the trunk into the salt­water, make these evergreen trees unique.</p>



<p>Salt kills most plants, but mangrove roots separate freshwater from salt for the tree to use. At low tide, the looping roots act like stilts and buttresses, keeping trunks and branches above the waterline and dry. Speckling these roots are thousands of specialized pores, or lenticels. The lenticels open to absorb gases from the atmosphere when exposed, but seal tight at high tide, keeping the mangrove from drowning.</p>



<p>The thickets of roots also prevent soil erosion and buffer coastlines against tropical storms. Within these roots and branches, shorebirds and fish — and in some places, manatees and dolphins — thrive.</p>



<p>Mangrove roots support an ecosystem that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1123">stores four times as much carbon</a> as inland forests. That’s because the saltwater slows decomposition of organic matter, says Kipkorir Lang’at, a principal scientist at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, or KMFRI. So when mangrove plants and animals die, their carbon gets trapped in thick soils. As long as mangroves stay standing, the carbon stays in the soil.</p>



<p>Robust estimates of mangrove forest area in Kenya before 1980 are not available, Lang’at says. However, with the clear-cutting of mangrove forests in Gazi Bay in the 1970s, he says, the area was left with vast expanses of bare, sandy coast.</p>



<p>Other parts of the country experienced similar losses: Kenya <a href="http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/154911/Wang%27ondu%2CV_Mangrove Degradation%2C Reversing ....pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">lost up to 20 percent of its mangrove forests</a> between 1985 and 2009 because no mechanism existed for their protection. The losses had a steep price: Just as mangroves absorb more carbon than inland forests, when destroyed, they release more carbon than other forests. And since the mangroves provided habitat and shelter for fish, their destruction meant that fishers were catching less.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center">percent</h5>



<p>Amount of mangrove forest Kenya lost between 1985 and 2009</p>
</div>



<p>Recognizing this high cost, as well as the eco­system’s other benefits, Kenya’s government ratified the Forest Conservation and Management Act of 2016, a law protecting mangroves and inland forests. Cutting down mangroves is now banned throughout the country, except in very specific areas under very specific circumstances.</p>



<p>Available data suggest that Kenya’s rate of mangrove loss has declined in the last two decades. The country is now losing about 0.65 percent of its mangrove forest annually, according to unpublished evaluations conducted in 2020 by KMFRI. Since the turn of the millennium, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63880-1">global mangrove deforestation has slowed</a> as well, hovering between a loss of 0.2 and 0.7 percent per year, says a 2020 study in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Mikoko Pamoja offers hope for turning around those declines. The project, whose Swahili name means “mangroves together,” has its roots in a small mangrove restoration effort that started in 1991 in Gazi Bay, spearheaded by KMFRI. The effort evolved into a scientific experiment to see what it would take to restore a degraded ecosystem. It attracted collaborators from Edinburgh Napier University, Europe’s Earthwatch Institute and other organizations across Europe.</p>



<p>Now, Gazi Forest boasts 615 hectares of mangrove forest, including 56,000 individual seedlings planted by the community. Plans to plant more mangrove trees — at least 2,000 per year — are in the works.</p>

<h4>Carbon keepers&nbsp; </h4>



<p>Compared with other major forest types, mangrove forests capture and store more carbon dioxide, especially within tree roots and surrounding soil.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Creating carbon credits</h4>



<p>Gazi Forest siphons carbon from the atmosphere at a rate of 3,000 metric tons per year, says Rahma Kivugo, the outgoing project coordinator for Mikoko Pamoja. These aren’t merely ballpark numbers: To sell the carbon offsets collected by Mikoko Pamoja, forest managers must calculate the amount of carbon stored by mangroves.</p>



<p>Volunteers venture into the forest twice a year, checking on 10 selected 10-square-meter plots in the wild forest and five plots in planted forest. Workers measure the diameter of mature trees at an adult’s chest height. They then estimate the trees’ height. Finally, they classify young trees as knee-height, waist-height, chest-height and higher.</p>



<p>From these observations, researchers estimate the volume of mangrove material above ground in each plot and extrapolate for the whole forest area.</p>



<p>Once they have an idea of the volume of plant material above ground, team members can estimate root volume below ground using a standardized factor specific to mangrove forests, says Mbatha Anthony, a research assistant at KMFRI in charge of carbon accounting. Even though mangrove forests store a lot of soil carbon, the project calculates carbon stored only by the tree itself because “calculating soil carbon is a resource-intensive undertaking for a small project like Mikoko Pamoja,” Anthony says.</p>



<p>With an estimate of the total volume of biomass in the forest in hand, “we can then translate that into tons of carbon,” says environmental biologist Mark Huxham of Edinburgh Napier University, who helps Mikoko Pamoja with its calculations. In general, 50 percent of aboveground biomass is carbon. Below ground, 39 percent of biomass is carbon.</p>



<p>The amount of carbon stored by Gazi Forest is then relayed to the <a href="https://www.planvivo.org/">Plan Vivo Foundation</a>, a group based in Scotland that certifies carbon calculations. Once its calculations are certified, Mikoko Pamoja receives Plan Vivo Certificates, or PVCs.</p>



<p>One PVC is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide emission reductions. These PVCs are submitted to the Association for Coastal Ecosystem Services — an organization that markets carbon credits for Mikoko Pamoja and similar projects. Through ACES, Mikoko Pamoja’s PVCs can then be purchased by anyone who wishes to offset their carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Roughly 117 hectares of Gazi Forest have been demarcated for the sale of carbon credits. “Mikoko Pamoja generates approximately $15,000 annually from the sale of carbon credits,” Anthony says. From 2014 to 2018, the project generated 9,880 credits — 9,880 tons of avoided carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<h4>A community at work</h4>



<p>Mikoko Pamoja sells carbon credits at more than $7 per ton. Revenues get split in a clearly defined manner, according to what residents decide are pressing needs of Makongeni and Gazi villages. Around 21 percent pays wages of residents involved with Mikoko Pamoja. And “more than half of what is earned goes toward community projects,” Kivugo says.</p>



<p>In total, about $117,000 has gone to community projects since Mikoko Pamoja was founded. These projects include donating medicine to health clinics and textbooks to schools and digging clean water wells. Plans are under way to revive a windmill in Gazi for pumping water and renovate Makongeni’s primary school.</p>



<p>“The need in the community is great. So carbon trading is unlikely to meet all the needs,” Huxham says. But the funds make a significant contribution to local livelihoods, which primes the community to support conservation, he says.</p>



<p>The approach seems to be working. On a winding path into the forest, visitors encounter a signboard, with large letters in Swahili declaring, “Take note! This is a Mikoko Pamoja area protected by the community. Littering is prohibited! Trimming trees is prohibited!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="421" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/091022_mangroves_inline_warning-800x421.jpg" alt="A sign in Gazi Bay mangrove forest in Swahili, which reads: &quot;ILANI!!!

Kamadi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Active community participation is central to Mikoko Pamoja’s success. Not only do community members plant mangrove seedlings and survey trees to gauge carbon storage, community scouts monitor the health of this ecosystem.</p>



<p>Scouts clean up litter within the forests and survey the forest’s biodiversity. From a wooden watchtower above the forest, scouts also track and report illegal logging.</p>



<p>“Should we spot suspicious activities in the forest, we will call the Kenya Forest Service rangers, who have the authority to detain and arrest any trespasser,” says local scout Shaban Jambia.</p>



<p>Back at the boardwalk, Hamadi leads a small knot of visitors through the mangroves, pausing occasionally to touch a tree’s waxy leaves. She plucks a propagule — a dark-brown pod longer than her hand — from a tree belonging to the mangrove species <em>Bruguiera gymnorhiza</em>.</p>



<p>She drops the propagule over the boardwalk’s handrail, into the soft marsh soil about 1.5 meters below. It lands, sticking almost perfectly perpendicular in the ground. “This will soon take root and germinate into a new plant,” she explains to the visitors. “That’s how this species propagates.”</p>



<p>Hamadi, the tour guide, is one of 27 members of the Gazi Women Mangrove Boardwalk group. Members offer interpretive services to visitors for a fee. The women also prepare Swahili cuisine for sale to groups visiting the area.</p>



<p>“A dish of coconut rice served with snapper fish is particularly popular, washed down with flavored black tea or tamarind juice,” says Mwanahamisi Bakari, the group’s treasurer.</p>



<p>These ecotourism efforts have attracted international support. The World Wide Fund for Nature Kenya, for instance, constructed a conference facility, which the women’s group rents to those who want to use the location as a backdrop to discuss sustainability efforts.</p>



<h4>A template for others</h4>



<p>Mikoko Pamoja’s success is spurring conservation efforts throughout Kenya and beyond. For instance, on southern Kenya’s coast is the Vanga Blue Forest, a swath of mangroves five times as large as Gazi Forest. Of Vanga Blue’s more than 3,000 hectares of mangrove forest, a little more than 15 percent — 460 hectares — has been set aside for the sale of carbon credits following Mikoko Pamoja’s example.</p>



<p>In 2020, with help from KFMRI, a network of scientists from countries along the western Indian Ocean <a href="http://wiomn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WIO-Mangrove-Restoration-Guidelines_Final-Version-of-Record-online-and-print.pdf">published a blueprint for mangrove restoration</a>. These guidelines are now being customized to suit the restoration plans of individual countries, says Lang’at. The group is also using Mikoko Pamoja’s carbon credit example to set up projects of its own.</p>



<p>Madagascar’s first community-led mangrove carbon project, known as <a href="https://www.planvivo.org/tahiry-honko">Tahiry Honko</a> (which means “preserving mangroves” in the local Vezo dialect), was introduced in 2013 and then certified for carbon sale by Plan Vivo in 2019. With Mikoko Pamoja as a guide, Tahiry Honko “is helping tackle climate breakdown and build community resilience by preserving and restoring mangrove forests,” says Lalao Aigrette, an adviser at Blue Ventures, the conservation group coordinating the preservation effort.</p>



<p>Tahiry Honko is generating carbon credits through the conservation and restoration of over 1,200 hectares of mangroves surrounding the Bay of Assassins on Madagascar’s southwest coast.</p>



<p>In Mozambique, studies are under way to gauge <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/decades-after-devastating-cyclone-mangroves-are-rebound-mozambique">how much mangrove preservation can protect communities against cyclones</a>, says Célia Macamo, a marine biologist at Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo, Mozambique.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the Limpopo estuary and other locations along the Mozambican coast are sites of mangrove restoration efforts. KMFRI is helping local organizers structure their efforts. “We also hope they will assist us when we start working with carbon credits,” Macamo adds.</p>

<p>Less than 1 percent of Earth’s surface is <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca9825en/ca9825en.pdf">covered by mangroves</a>, equivalent to 14.8 million hectares. “Because this area is minuscule compared to terrestrial forests, mangroves have been neglected throughout the world,” says James Kairo, chief scientist at KMFRI.</p>



<p>At Gazi Bay, a 2011 assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that the mangrove forests are worth about <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7948/EA_Mangrove_forests.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y">$1,092 per hectare per year</a>, thanks in part to the potential of fisheries, aquaculture, carbon sequestration and damages averted by the coastal protection that mangroves provide. Assuming that numbers in Gazi Bay hold for the rest of the world, mangroves could provide more than $16 billion in economic benefits planetwide.</p>



<p>Toward the end of 2020, Kenya’s government included mangroves and seagrasses for the first time in its Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs — the greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments for countries that ratified the Paris Agreement. The agreement seeks to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>This inclusion commits Kenya to conserving mangroves to balance its emissions. Kenya’s government now “recognizes the potential and importance of the mangrove and seagrass resources that Kenya has,” Huxham says.</p>



<p>“This is a great commitment on the part of the government. The next challenge is the implementation of these commitments,” says Kairo, who sits on the advisory board of the <a href="https://www.oceandecade.org/">U.N. Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development</a> (2021–2030), which aims to support efforts to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health.</p>



<p>Now, scientists and community managers for that effort need to determine how mangroves can adapt to rising sea levels. “How can communities next to the sea live in harmony with this system, without impacting on their resiliency and productivity?” Kairo asks.</p>



<p>Mikoko Pamoja is helping provide answers, Kairo adds. Thanks in large part to that small project that began in a secluded corner on the Kenya coast, those answers are now spreading to the rest of the world.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise authors to provide all relevant information in their manuscript.

Try to put yourself into the shoes of the reviewers and re-read the article from another perspective, from the title to all figures and tables, from punctuation to grammar. Though the accuracy of tables and grammar may not be the priority when reviewers are deciding whether to accept the paper or not, it shows respect to the journals and reviewers. Treat your reviewers as you hope they will treat you”. </span><strong>Prof Guo-wei Tu, Chief Physician and Associate Professor of Critical Care Medicine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</strong></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise authors to really highlight how their research is contributing to the specific field and how their findings fit in the wider picture. Authors should always consider statistical power and also consult an experienced analyst, when performing their statistical analysis and presenting their results for a manuscript. The Methods section is a vital part of each manuscript and should include enough details to enable the reviewers to ascertain the credibility of the experiment/study/analysis. Authors should make sure that they are as transparent as possible when describing the methods to avoid delays or unfavorable reviews”. </span><strong>Dr Stavroula Kanoni, Lecturer in Nutrigenetics and Cardiovascular Health in the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, at William Harvey Research Institute, Barts &amp; the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK</strong></li>

If you feel it is not sound, please work on it again and revise what is not sound. When you submit papers, please take the time to carefully check for English language and typos as these might limit the attraction of a manuscript for a reviewer, who usually revises a lot of papers every week. In addition, statistical analysis is often neglected or covered in a superficial way, but this is very important. Wrong analyses lead to wrong results. In general, although time is important in research, please do take the time to double-check that every aspect is perfect, or nearly perfect before submitting”. </span><strong>Dr Aldo Bonaventura, Division of Internal Medicine at the Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese (Italy)</strong></li>

I would encourage authors to mention additional scientific queries, limitations of their studies/methods used, any biased approach followed during analysis, and try to interpret and discuss all results. If English is not their first language, I would recommend authors utilize institutional/private creative writing and editing services.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-camouflage-prey-predator-strategy">Not all camouflage is equal. Here are prey animals’ best options</a></h4>

              
                <p>From crabs to caterpillars, a wide range of animals successfully use camouflage to hamper detection by hungry predators. But some concealment strategies are more effective than others, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>The analysis compiles and synthesizes data from scores of studies on animal camouflage. Comparisons between different camouflaging methods show that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0980">masquerading as specific objects in the environment</a> is the best way to go unseen, scientists report September 14 in <em>Proceedings B of the Royal Society</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Behavioral and sensory ecologist João Vitor de Alcantara Viana had been studying animal camouflage for his doctoral research when he realized a comprehensive comparison of different camouflage strategies had never been done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was a big gap in the literature on this topic,” says de Alcantara Viana, of the State University of Campinas in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>



<p>So, de Alcantara Viana and colleagues searched scientific publication databases for studies on animal camouflage dated from 1900 through July 2022. The team zeroed in on 84 studies that&nbsp;experimentally tested at least one camouflage strategy, and&nbsp;reported either how long predators took to find camouflaged prey or how often predators attacked. The team also limited their analysis to studies that compared camouflaged prey with noncamouflaged, often artificial, versions.</p>



<p>Next, the team grouped the data from these studies by the types of predators and prey analyzed and the variety of camouflage strategies examined. Camouflage tactics included “background matching,” where the animal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/leaping-land-fish-avoids-predators-blending">matches the color and patterning of the environment</a>, and “masquerading,” where prey mimics a particular object uninteresting to predators, like a twig, a leaf, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/bird-dropping-disguise-proves-be-effective-camouflage">bird dropping</a> or even a shed tarantula skin (<em>SN: 12/10/13; SN: 6/6/14</em>).</p>



<p>Camouflage is generally effective at making the hunt difficult for predators, increasing their search time by more than 62 percent and dropping the rate they attack prey by more than 27 percent across the board, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the type of prey mattered. Caterpillars got more benefit from camouflage than their winged adult forms, for example. This may be because moths and butterflies can fly and have other antipredator adaptations available to them, de Alcantara Viana says.</p>



<p>The masquerade strategy was especially effective at helping prey elude predators, increasing search time by nearly 300 percent. One of the most striking examples of this, says de Alcantara Viana, are caterpillars that disguise themselves as twigs. A study on brimstone moth caterpillars (<em>Opisthograptis luteolata</em>) and chickens showed that the birds take longer to attack masquerading caterpillars after being recently exposed to twigs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Masquerading as the most effective camouflage strategy is intriguing, says Anna Hughes, a sensory ecologist at the University of Essex in England who was not involved with this research. “If this is indeed the case, it will be interesting to further investigate the constraints — size, movement requirements — that mean that not all animals evolve this strategy,” she says. The researchers note that masquerading is probably more likely to evolve if the animal is a similar size as the object it’s mimicking. This could limit what species can benefit from this super camo.</p>



<p>de Alcantara Viana and his colleagues think masquerading is so effective because it’s so specialized, with animals impersonating specific objects, compared with other strategies based on blending in against an irregular background. Prey that masquerade benefit from the predator misidentifying them as real objects in the environment, not just failing to detect the prey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The quality of the new work is excellent, Hughes says. Still, it’s not quite clear if the noncamouflaged controls, which she says vary quite widely from one study to another, have inherently different effects on predator reactions. This could make the tested camouflage seem more or less effective than it is in nature.</p>



<p>Another notable finding from the new analysis is that most studies have been conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, Hughes says. “I think it is clear that our understanding of the evolution of camouflage strategies is going to be, by definition, incomplete unless more studies are carried out in the Southern Hemisphere.”</p>



<p>Much of recent camouflage research has also tried to understand precisely how specific defenses protect prey from attacks, says Tom Sherratt, an evolutionary ecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, also not involved with this study.</p>



<p>“We are now at a point where we can begin to compare among these defenses,” Sherratt says, which can help researchers figure out why species use particular camouflage strategies.</p>



<p>de Alcantara Viana says he and his colleagues are working on another analysis to understand “the other side of the coin,” how camouflaged predators benefit from concealing themselves from prey.</p>

<p><strong>What holds the proton together</strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hint-what-holds-proton-together"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 16, 1972</p>



<p>An experiment … at the CERN Laboratory in Geneva … gives an important clue to structural arrangements deep within the proton…. The result hints at the existence of a new and very strong fundamental interaction — the process that holds [quarks] together inside the protons.… A number of theorists have speculated about its nature and have even proposed an intermediate particle for it called a gluon.<br></p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Physicists finally found evidence for gluons in 1979, in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/squeezing-out-universal-glue">aftermath of electron-positron collisions</a> at a German particle accelerator (<em>SN: 4/21/79, p. 262</em>). Gluons bind quarks inside protons via the strong force — the most powerful force in nature. Recent investigations of gluons’ role inside the proton suggest the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-mass-quarks-calculation">particles’ energy makes up about 36 percent of the proton’s mass</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 8</em>). Future particle accelerators could gauge gluons’ contribution to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protons-insides-pressure-strong-force">proton’s internal pressure</a>, which averages a million trillion trillion times the strength of Earth’s atmospheric pressure (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 10</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-crust-formation-milky-way-galaxy-comets">Passing through the Milky Way’s arms may have helped form Earth’s solid ground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s journey through the Milky Way might have helped create the planet’s first continents.</p>



<p>Comets may have bombarded Earth every time the early solar system traveled through our galaxy’s spiral arms, a new study suggests. Those recurring barrages <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G50513.1/616377/Did-transit-through-the-galactic-spiral-arms-seed">in turn helped trigger the formation of our planet’s continental crust</a>, researchers propose August 23 in <em>Geology</em>.</p>



<p>Previous theories have suggested that such impacts might have played a role in forming Earth&#8217;s landmasses. But there has been little research explaining how those impacts occurred, until now, the team says.</p>





<p>It’s an intriguing hypothesis, other scientists say, but it’s not the last word when it comes to explaining how Earth got its landmasses.</p>



<p>To peer back in time, geochronologist Chris Kirkland and his colleagues turned to geologic structures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/continental-hearts">known as cratons</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>). These relics of Earth’s ancient continental crust are some of the planet’s oldest rocks. Using material from cratons in Australia and Greenland that are billions of years old, the team measured the chemistry of more than 2,000 bits of rock. The analysis let the researchers determine the exact ages of the rocks, and whether they had formed anew from molten material deep within the Earth or from earlier generations of existing crust.</p>



<p>When Kirkland and his colleagues looked for patterns in their measurements, the team found that new crust seemed to form in spurts at roughly regular intervals. “Every 200 million years, we see a pattern of more crust production,” says Kirkland, of Curtin University in Perth, Australia.</p>



<p>That timing rang a bell: It’s also the frequency at which the Earth passes through the spiral arms of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-milky-way-could-help-map-galactic-structure">the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 12/30/15</em>). The solar system loops around the center of the galaxy a bit faster than the spiral arms move, periodically passing through and overtaking them. Perhaps cosmic encounters with more stars, gas and dust within the spiral arms affected the young planet, the team suggests.</p>



<p>The idea makes sense, the researchers say, since the higher density of material in the spiral arms would have led to more gravitational tugs on the reservoir of comets at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oort-cloud-comets-spin-death">our solar system’s periphery</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/22</em>). Some of those encounters would have sent comets zooming into the inner solar system, and a fraction of those icy denizens would have collided with Earth, Kirkland and his team propose.</p>



<p>Earth was probably covered mostly by oceans billions of years ago, and the energy delivered by all those comets would have fractured the planet’s existing oceanic crust — the relatively dense rock present since even earlier in Earth’s history — and excavated copious amounts of material while launching shock waves into the planet. That mayhem would have primed the way for parts of Earth’s mantle to melt, Kirkland says. The resulting magma would have naturally separated into a denser part — the precursor to more oceanic crust — and a lighter, more buoyant liquid that eventually turned into continental crust, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>That’s one hypothesis, but it’s far from a slam dunk, says Jesse Reimink, a geoscientist at Penn State who was not involved in the research. For starters, comet and meteorite impacts are notoriously tough to trace, especially that far back in time, he says. “There’s very few diagnostics of impacts.” And it’s not well-known whether such impacts, if they occurred in the first place, would have resulted in the release of magma, he says.</p>



<p>In the future, Kirkland and his colleagues hope to analyze <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">moon rocks</a> to look for the same pattern of crust formation (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>). Our nearest celestial neighbor would have been walloped by about the same amount of stuff that hit Earth, Kirkland says. “You’d predict it’d also be subject to these periodic impact events.”</p>
