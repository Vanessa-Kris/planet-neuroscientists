                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change">By 2100, Greenland will be losing ice at its fastest rate in 12,000 years</a></h4>

<p>By 2100, Greenland will be shedding ice <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2742-6">faster than at any time in the past 12,000 years</a>, scientists report October 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Since the 1990s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-burning-greenland-melting-thanks-record-heat">Greenland has shed its ice</a> at an increasing rate (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>). Meltwater from the island’s ice sheet now contributes about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">0.7 millimeters per year</a> to global sea level rise (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). But how does this rapid loss stack up against the ice sheet’s recent history, including during a 3,000-year-long warm period?</p>



<p>Glacial geologist Jason Briner of the University at Buffalo in New York and colleagues created a master timeline of ice sheet changes spanning nearly 12,000 years, from the dawn of the Holocene Epoch 11,700 years ago and projected out to 2100.</p>



<p>The researchers combined climate and ice physics simulations with observations of the extent of past ice sheets, marked by moraines. Those rocky deposits denote the edges of ancient, bulldozing glaciers. New fine-tuned climate simulations that include spatial variations in temperature and precipitation across the island also improved on past temperature reconstructions.</p>



<p>During the past warm episode from about 10,000 to 7,000 years ago, Greenland lost ice at a rate of about 6,000 billion metric tons each century, the team estimates. That rate remained unmatched until the past two decades: From 2000 to 2018, the average rate of ice loss was similar, at about 6,100 billion tons per century.</p>



<p>Over the next century, that pace will accelerate, the team says. How much depends on future greenhouse gas emissions: Under a lower-emissions scenario, ice loss is projected to average around 8,800 billion tons per century by 2100. With higher emissions, the rate of loss could ramp up to 35,900 billion tons per century.</p>



<p>Lower emissions could slow the loss, but “no matter what humanity does, the ice will melt this century at a faster clip than it did during that warm period,” Briner says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2020">This year’s SN 10 scientists aim to solve some of science’s biggest challenges</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">In the midst of a pandemic that has brought so much worry and loss, it’s natural to want to help — to do some small part to solve a problem, to counter pain, or to, importantly, remind others that there is beauty and wonder in the world. Scientists have long been doing just that. Many are chasing answers to the myriad challenges that people face every day, and revealing the rewards in the pursuit of knowledge itself. It’s in that spirit that we present this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">For the sixth consecutive year</a>, <em>Science News</em> is featuring 10 early- and mid-career scientists who are pushing the boundaries of scientific inquiry. Some of the researchers are asking questions with huge societal importance: How do we <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#mueller">prevent teen suicide</a>? What are the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#fischer">ingredients in wildfire smoke</a> that are damaging to health? Is there a better way to<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#zhan"> monitor earthquakes to save lives</a>? What about finding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#shapiro">new ways to diagnose and treat diseases</a>?</p>



<p>Others are trying to grasp how weird and wonderful the natural world is — from exploring <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#ananna">how many supermassive black holes are out there in space</a> to understanding the minuscule genetic details that drive evolution. For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/feed#zanders">SaraH Zanders</a>, one of this year’s SN 10, is unveiling the drama that unfolds when life divvies up its genetic material.</p>



<p>A couple of the scientists on this year’s list have also taken steps to support people from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. These researchers see how science benefits when people from diverse backgrounds contribute to the pursuit of answers.</p>





<p>All of this year’s honorees are age 40 and under, and all were nominated by Nobel laureates, recently elected members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences or previous SN 10 scientists. The world feels very different than it did at the start of 2020, when we first put out our call for SN 10 nominations, but the passion these scientists have for their work endures. The curiosity, creativity and drive of this crew offers hope that we can overcome some of our biggest challenges.</p>



<p>Though it often takes time, out of crisis comes action. Also out of crisis comes a renewed appreciation for small pleasures that give life meaning. These researchers find joy in the search for scientific answers. Here’s how Zanders describes what motivates her work: “It’s just I like to solve puzzles.”  — <em>Elizabeth Quill</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="ananna">Black hole hunter seeks a cosmic census</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Tonima Tasnim Ananna" class="wp-image-3091870" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_tta-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091870">Credit: Eli Burakian/Dartmouth College</span></figure>



<h4>Tonima Tasnim Ananna, 29<br />Astrophysicist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Dartmouth College<br />Hometown: Dhaka, Bangladesh<br />Favorite black hole: Cygnus X-1</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>Tonima Tasnim Ananna is bringing the heaviest black holes out of hiding. She has drawn the most complete picture yet of black holes across the universe — where they are, how they grow and how they affect their environments. And she did it with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>As far as astronomers can tell, nearly every galaxy stows a black hole at its center, weighing millions or billions of times the mass of the sun. Though these supermassive black holes can heat surrounding material until it glows brighter than all the galaxy’s stars combined, the light can be concealed by gas and dust also drawn in by the black hole’s pull. High-energy X-rays cut through that dusty veil. So for her Ph.D., completed in 2019, Ananna gathered surveys from four X-ray telescopes, more datasets than any previous study had used. Her goal was to create a model of how black holes grow and change across cosmic history. “It was supposed to be a short paper,” Ananna says. But models that explained one or a few of the datasets didn’t work for the full sample. “It stumped us for some time.”</p>



<p>To break the gridlock, she developed a neural network, a type of artificial intelligence, to find <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aafb77">a description of the black hole population</a> that explained what all the observatories saw. “She just went off and taught herself machine learning,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University, Ananna’s Ph.D. adviser. “She doesn’t say, ‘Oh, I can’t do this.’ She just figures out a way to learn it and do it.” One early result of the model suggests that there are many more active black holes out there than previously realized.</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Black holes could be gobbling down gas as fast as theoretically possible.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Galaxies live and die by their black holes. “When a black hole puts out energy into the galaxy, it can cause stars to form,” Ananna says. “Or it could blow gas away,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasar-winds-record-energy-levels-seen-fleeing-distant-galaxy">shutting down star formation and stunting the galaxy’s growth</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/20</em>). So understanding black holes is key to understanding how cosmic structures — everything from galaxy clusters down to planets and perhaps even life — came to be. Ananna’s model is built on data describing black holes at different cosmic distances. Because looking far in space is like looking back in time, the model shows how black holes grow and change over time. It could also help figure out how efficiently black holes eat. Early hints suggest black holes could be gobbling down gas as fast as theoretically possible, which may help explain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">how some got so big so fast</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>).</p>



<h5>Inspiration</h5>



<p>When Ananna was a 5-year-old in Dhaka, Bangladesh, her mother told her about the Pathfinder spacecraft landing on Mars. Her mother was a homemaker, she says, but was curious about science and encouraged Ananna’s curiosity, too. “That’s when I realized there were other worlds,” she says. “That’s when I wanted to study astronomy.” There were not a lot of opportunities to study space in Bangladesh, so she came to the United States for undergrad, attending Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. She chose an all-women’s school not known for a lot of drinking to reassure her parents that she was not “going abroad to party.” Although Ananna intended to keep her head down and study, she was surprised by the social opportunities she found. “The women at Bryn Mawr were fiercely feminist, articulate, opinionated and independent,” she says. “It really helped me grow a lot.” Traveling for internships at NASA and CERN, the European particle physics laboratory near Geneva, and a year at the University of Cambridge, boosted her confidence. (She did end up going to some parties — “no alcohol for me, though.”)</p>



<p>Now, Ananna is giving back. She cofounded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community/Wi-STEM-Women-In-STEM-726164967495408/">Wi-STEM</a> (pronounced “wisdom”), a mentorship network for girls and young women who are interested in science. She and four other Bangladeshi scientists who studied in the United States mentor a group of 20 female high school and college students in Bangladesh, helping them find paths to pursue science.  <em>— Lisa Grossman</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="corsi">Pioneer pairs light with gravity waves</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Alessandra Corsi" class="wp-image-3091862" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_ac-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091862">Credit: Texas Tech Univ.</span></figure>



<h4>Alessandra Corsi, 40<br />Astrophysicist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Texas Tech University<br />Hometown: Rome, Italy<br />Favorite telescope: Very Large Array, New Mexico</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>On September 3, 2017, Alessandra Corsi finally saw what she had been waiting for since mid-August: a small dot in her telescope images that was the radio afterglow of a neutron star collision. That stellar clash, discovered by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory team, or LIGO, which included Corsi, was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">first direct sighting of a neutron star collision</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). The event, dubbed GW170817, was also the first of any kind seen in both gravitational waves and light waves.</p>



<p>Telescopes around the world spotted all kinds of light from the crash site, but one particular kind, the radio waves, took their sweet time showing up. Corsi had been waiting since August 17, when the gravitational waves were spotted. “Longest two weeks of my life,” Corsi says. The radio waves were key to understanding a superfast particle jet launched by the colliding stars.</p>



<p>Early on, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smothered-jet-may-explain-weird-light-neutron-star-crash">the jet appeared to have been smothered</a> by a plume of debris from the collision (<em>SN: 12/20/17</em>). But follow-up radio observations made by Corsi’s team and others confirmed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-neutron-stars-light-speed-space">the jet had punched through the wreckage</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/19</em>). This jet was the first of its kind to be seen from the side, allowing Corsi and colleagues to probe its structure. The jet almost certainly would have gone unnoticed if the gravitational waves hadn’t clued astronomers in.</p>

<p>Corsi is a pioneer in the new field of multimessenger astronomy, which pairs observations of light waves with spacetime ripples, or gravitational waves. The pairing is like having eyes and ears on the cosmos, Corsi says. “You cannot learn all that you could with only one of the two.” In the case of GW170817, gravitational waves revealed how the neutron stars danced around each other as they spiraled toward collision, and light waves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strontium-heavy-element-neutron-star-merger">unveiled the type of material left in the aftermath</a> (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Using this multimessenger approach could also give astronomers a more complete picture of other cataclysms, such as smashups between neutron stars and black holes, and the explosive deaths of massive stars. Such spectacular events “reveal some of the most fundamental physics in our universe,” Corsi says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>If gravitational wave signals were converted into sound, they would create their own kind of music.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Most researchers specialize in either gravitational waves or light, but Corsi “is very well-versed in both messengers,” says Wen-fai Fong, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “That makes her extremely versatile in terms of the types of multimessenger science she can study.”</p>



<h5>What’s next</h5>



<p>Corsi has now built a computational tool to scan LIGO data for gravitational waves stirred up by whatever is left behind in a neutron star merger. The tool is based <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/702/2/1171/meta">on a paper she published in 2009</a> — years before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">LIGO scored its first gravitational wave detection</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). The paper describes the gravitational wave pattern that would signal the presence of one possible remnant: a rapidly spinning, elongated neutron star. Alternatively, a neutron star smashup could leave behind a black hole. Knowing which “tells us a lot about how matter behaves at densities way higher than we could ever explore in a lab,” Corsi says.</p>



<h5>Inspiration</h5>



<p>Corsi taught herself to play the piano in high school, and now enjoys playing both classical music and tunes from favorite childhood movies, like Beauty and the Beast. The audio frequencies of piano notes are similar to the frequencies of spacetime tremors picked up by LIGO. If gravitational wave signals were converted into sound, they would create their own kind of music. “That’s the thing I like to think of when I’m playing,” she says.  <em>— Maria Temming</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="fischer">What’s in smoky air?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Emily Fischer" class="wp-image-3091865" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_ef-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091865">Credit: Bill Cotton/Colorado State Univ.</span></figure>



<h4>Emily Fischer, 39<br />Atmospheric chemist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Colorado State University<br />Hometown: Richmond, R.I.<br />Favorite outdoor activities: Cross-country skiing and gardening</p>



<h5>Motivation</h5>



<p>Emily Fischer has always cared about air pollution. “It’s innate.… It’s a calling,” she says. Exposure to air pollution raises your risk for many common ailments, such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes and obesity. But unlike some other risk factors for these diseases, “you can’t choose not to breathe, right? You have to have clean air for everyone.” In her youth, she organized rallies to clean up the cigarette smoke–filled air of her Rhode Island high school. That interest led Fischer to study atmospheric chemistry and motivates her current work as a self-described air pollution detective. Air pollution may conjure images of thick black plumes billowing from smokestacks, but Fischer says most air pollution is invisible and poorly understood. She combines analytical chemistry with high-flying techniques to understand where air pollution comes from and how it changes as it moves through the air.</p>



<h5>Bold idea</h5>



<p>Wildfire smoke like that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">filling the skies in the American West this season</a> is a major, but still mysterious, source of air pollution. Thousands of different solids, liquids and gases swirl together to form wildfire smoke, and its chemical composition changes as it blows through the atmosphere. This dynamic mixture, which is also affected by what’s burning on the ground, is tricky to measure, since each of its many components requires highly specialized equipment and expertise to assess. The equipment also has to be airborne, typically lofted into the air via planes or balloons. “There has been beautiful work on wildfire smoke,” Fischer says, “but in most studies, we just have not had all the measurements needed to really interpret things.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You can’t choose not to breathe, right? You have to have clean air for everyone.”</p><cite>Emily Fischer</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To get a fuller view, she dreamed big: “Why not try to measure everything, and measure it systematically?” She pulled together a diverse team of 10 lead researchers, and scores more graduate students and postdocs, to pull off the most comprehensive analysis of wildfire smoke ever attempted, a project dubbed <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/we-can">WE-CAN</a>. During the summer of 2018, Fischer led over a dozen six-hour flights over the West, chasing wildfire smoke plumes and systematically measuring the air in and around smoke plumes with nearly 30 different instruments crammed into the cargo hold of a C-130 plane.</p>



<p>“[WE-CAN] is a big collaboration,” says Ronald Cohen, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California, Berkeley. He says success stemmed in large part from the team that came together.</p>



<p>“Making an environment for successful collaboration is really satisfying to me,” Fischer says.</p>



<p>While team members are still analyzing the data, the project is already revealing some of the smoke’s secrets. For example, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide — two chemicals linked to cancer and other health problems — are abundant in wildfire smoke. Recent wildfires show how important it is to understand the role of climate change in fires, Fischer says, and “who is most vulnerable in our society, and how we can best prepare and protect those communities.”</p>



<p>Fisher is also planning to adapt some of what she’s learned from WE-CAN to track ammonia emissions from farms and feed lots, which are another major source of air pollution.</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<p>Fischer is deeply committed to bringing more undergraduate women, especially women of color, into the geosciences. And she’s using science to figure out how. She brought a team of social scientists and geoscientists together to study how different interventions can help. She and colleagues found that for every female role model a student has, her probability of continuing on in her geosciences major roughly doubles. Having someone to look up to who looks like them is key to building a sense of belonging and identity as a scientist, Fischer says. To help build that network, Fischer started <a href="https://geosciencewomen.org/">PROGRESS</a>, a workshop and mentorship program that aims to support undergraduate women in the geosciences. Started at Colorado State University in 2014, the program has since expanded, reaching over 300 women at institutions across the United States.</p>



<p>For her own mentees, Fischer tries to instill a willingness to take risks and go after big, bold questions. “The easy things are done,” she says. Pushing forward our understanding of pressing questions means chasing research projects that might lead nowhere, she says, or might crack open a new field of research. “It’s OK to be wrong, and it’s OK to take risks. That’s what science needs right now.”  <em>— Jonathan Lambert</em></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Prashant Jain" class="wp-image-3091867" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_pj-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091867">Credit: L. Brian Stauffer/UI News Bureau</span></figure>



<h4>Prashant Jain, 38<br />Physical chemist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br />Hometown: Mumbai, India<br />Favorite element: Gold</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<p>Prashant Jain explores how light interacts with matter — such as how plants use sunlight to photosynthesize — and applies that knowledge to new problems. He recently took lessons from nature to convert carbon dioxide into other useful molecules. In a paper last year in <em>Nature Communications</em>, Jain and Sungju Yu, also at Illinois at the time, reported using gold nanoparticles as a catalyst <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10084-5">to drive chemical reactions between carbon dioxide and water</a>.</p>



<p>When light hit the nanoparticles, it set off a series of reactions that converted carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels such as methane and propane. In essence, the process not only sucked carbon dioxide — a greenhouse gas — out of the air, but it also made that carbon into fuel. No wonder the oil giant Shell is funding Jain’s work. The whole process isn’t very efficient, so Jain is working to improve how much carbon dioxide gets used and how much fuel gets produced. But along the way he hopes to learn more about how nature uses energy to make matter — and to inspire his lab to create more sustainable and renewable energy technologies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I am myself still a student.”</p><cite>Prashant Jain</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In another example of using chemistry to push toward future technologies, Jain and colleagues shined light on gold and platinum nanoparticles and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202007202">triggered reactions that liberated hydrogen from ammonia molecules</a>. Hydrogen is important in many industries — fuel cells for zero-carbon vehicles use it, for example — but it can be dangerous to transport because it’s flammable. Jain’s discovery could allow workers to transport ammonia instead, which is safer, and then free the hydrogen from the ammonia once it has arrived where’s it needed. The work was reported online in July in <em>Angewandte Chemie.</em></p>



<h5>Superpower</h5>



<p>Jain has a remarkable ability and optimism to see unsuccessful laboratory experiments as successful steps toward understanding the natural world, says Karthish Manthiram, a chemical engineer at MIT. As a first-year graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, Manthiram remembers being frustrated that his experiments weren’t turning out as expected. But Jain, a postdoctoral fellow in the same lab, stepped in to help and recast the problematic results. “He’s always viewed what others see as failure as moments of clarity that build up to moments when things make more sense,” Manthiram says. “For me that was an important lesson in how to be a scientist.”</p>



<h5>Inspiration</h5>



<p>Growing up in a family that worked mostly in business and finance, Jain fell in love with science as a preteen — inspired in part by watching the movie <em>Jurassic Park</em> and its fictional depiction of what might be possible through understanding the molecular world. Soon he spotted a physics textbook for sale from a street vendor and bought it. “I tried to read the book, nothing much made sense,” he says. “I wanted to be the one to figure out all these mysteries of nature.” He chose to major in chemical engineering in college (inspired in part by a magazine published by the chemical company DuPont), and then switched to physical chemistry when he moved to the United States to get a Ph.D.</p>



<p>Promoted this year to full professor, Jain has never stopped pushing to acquire new knowledge; when he finished teaching this last spring semester, he enrolled in an online MIT course on quantum information science. “I am myself still a student,” he says.  <em>— Alexandra Witze</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="mueller">Challenging ideas about youth suicide</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Anna Mueller" class="wp-image-3091863" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_am-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091863">Credit: Sarah Diefendorf</span></figure>



<h4>Anna Mueller, 40<br />Sociologist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Indiana University<br />Hometown: Houston, Texas<br />Favorite fieldwork: Observing rituals</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>Between 2000 and 2015, at a high school of about 2,000 students in the town of Poplar Grove (a pseudonym), 16 former and current students died by suicide; three other similar-aged individuals in the community, mostly at private schools, also took their own lives. A clinician who had grown up in the town reached out to Anna Mueller for help breaking the cruel cycle. Before that e-mail in fall 2013, Mueller was using big data to understand why teen and young adult suicide rates in the United States were spiking. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that suicides among 10- to 24-year-olds jumped 56 percent between 2007 and 2017.</p>



<p>Scholars theorized that suicidal people attracted other suicidal people. But Mueller’s work undercut that idea. In 2015 in the <em>Journal of Health and Social Behavior</em>, for instance, she reported that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472458/#!po=77.0000">merely having a suicidal friend did not increase a teen’s suicide risk</a>. A teen’s risk only went up with awareness that a teenage friend had made a suicide attempt. “Knowledge of the attempt matters to transforming … risk,” Mueller says. She carried an understanding of that contagion effect to Poplar Grove, where she worked with sociologist Seth Abrutyn of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, the half of the duo who is more focused on the theoretical.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Anna Mueller’s long-term goal is to create a sort of litmus test that identifies schools that could be at risk of a suicide cluster.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The team conducted 110 interviews and focus group meetings, lasting from 45 minutes to four hours, with Poplar Grove residents, plus some individuals outside the community for comparison. The team’s research revealed that teens felt an intense pressure to achieve in their affluent, mostly white town, where everybody seemed to know everyone else. While teens and young adults in a first wave of suicides might have had mental health problems, peers and community members often attributed those deaths to the town’s pressure cooker environment. That narrative, however incomplete, was especially strong when the youth who killed themselves were classic overachievers. Tragically, over time, that script became embedded in the local culture, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-how-mass-trauma-affects-mental-health?signup=success">making even youth who weren’t previously suicidal see suicide as a viable option</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/19</em>), Mueller says.</p>



<p>Mueller and Abrutyn were among the first researchers to start chipping away at the underlying reasons for why suicide rates have been rising in high schoolers, particularly overachieving girls without obvious underlying mental health problems, says Bernice Pescosolido, a sociologist at Indiana University in Bloomington who helped bring Mueller into the school’s sociology department. “What Anna and Seth have really been able to show is how imitation works and what the contagion effect looks like on the ground.”</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<p>Mueller’s long-term goal is to create a sort of litmus test that identifies schools that could be at risk of a suicide cluster. That way, school and community leaders can intervene before the first suicide and its resulting firestorm. Since fall 2018, she has been researching suicide trends in school districts in Colorado that are more diverse than Poplar Grove. When it comes to school culture, her early work shows, there’s often a trade-off between academic or athletic excellence and a supportive environment.</p>



<h5>Top tool</h5>



<p>In anticipation of her work in Poplar Grove, Mueller knew she needed a more boots-on-the-ground approach than her big data training allowed. So she trained in qualitative methods, including how to design a study; interview techniques, such as how to write questions to elicit desired conversations; and the detailed data analysis required for this research tactic.  </p>



<p>Mueller also sees the value in observing interactions, a common sociological approach. This spring, with the pandemic in full swing, she spent a lot of time on her home computer watching socially distant graduation ceremonies in her Colorado schools. She found that a school’s culture showed in the details, such as whether valedictorians addressed hot-button issues, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, in their speeches. “Of all of my moments in the field, rituals are the ones that tug at my own heartstrings because I’m watching kids graduate and that’s just inherently beautiful, but it also is a very powerful data moment,” she says.  <em>— Sujata Gupta</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="shanahan">The inner lives of protons and neutrons</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Phiala Shanahan" class="wp-image-3091868" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_ps-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091868">Credit: P. Shanahan</span></figure>



<h4>Phiala Shanahan, 29<br />Theoretical physicist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: MIT<br />Hometown: Adelaide, Australia<br />Favorite subatomic particle: The gluon</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<p>When Phiala Shanahan was a graduate student, she was shocked to learn that experiments <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-may-be-closer-solving-proton-size-mystery">disagreed on the size of the proton</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/19</em>). “Protons and neutrons are the key building blocks of 99 percent of the visible matter in the universe,” she says. “And we know, in some sense, surprisingly little about their internal structure.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“If there’s something I don’t understand, I’m extremely stubborn when it comes to figuring out the answer.”</p><cite>Phiala Shanahan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>That ignorance inspires her studies. She aims to calculate the characteristics of protons and neutrons based on fundamental physics. That includes not just their size, but also their mass and the nature of their components — how, for example, the quarks and gluons that make them up are sprinkled around inside. Such calculations can help scientists put the standard model, the theory that governs elementary particles and their interactions, to the test.</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>Shanahan is known for her prowess calculating the influence of gluons, particles that carry the strong force, which binds the proton together. For example, when gluons’ contributions are included, the proton is <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.072003">squeezed to a pressure</a> greater than estimated to exist within incredibly dense neutron stars, she and a coauthor reported in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> in 2019. “It’s a very remarkable calculation,” says physicist Volker Burkert of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Va. “That’s very fundamental, and it’s the first time it has been done.” Because they have no electric charge, gluons tend to elude experimental measurements, and that has left the particles neglected in theoretical calculations as well. Shanahan’s gluon results should be testable at a new particle collider, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">Electron-Ion Collider</a>, planned to be built at Brookhaven National Lab in Upton, N.Y. (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>).</p>



<h5>Superpower</h5>



<p>Persistence. “I hate not knowing something,” she says. “So if there’s something I don’t understand, I’m extremely stubborn when it comes to figuring out the answer.”</p>



<h5>Top tool</h5>



<p>A technique called lattice QCD is the foundation for Shanahan’s work. It’s named for quantum chromodynamics, the piece of the standard model that describes the behavior of quarks and gluons. QCD should allow scientists to predict the properties of protons and neutrons from the bottom up, but the theory is incredibly complex, making full calculations impossible to perform even on the best available supercomputers. Lattice QCD is a shortcut. It breaks up space and time into a grid on which particles reside, simplifying calculations. Shanahan is leading efforts to use machine learning to rev up lattice QCD calculations — putting her persistence to good use. “We don’t have to rely on computers getting better. We can have smarter algorithms for exploiting those computers,” she says. She hopes to speed up calculations enough that she can go beyond protons and neutrons, working her way up to the properties of atomic nuclei.  <em>— Emily Conover</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="shapiro">How to engineer cellular helpers</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Mikhail Shapiro" class="wp-image-3091866" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_ms-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091866">Credit: Caltech</span></figure>



<h4>Mikhail Shapiro, 39<br />Biochemical engineer</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Caltech<br />Hometown: Kolomna, Russia<br />Favorite protein: He can’t pick just one</p>



<h5>Bold idea</h5>



<p>Mikhail Shapiro believes that in the future, “we’re going to have smart biological devices that are roaming our bodies, diagnosing and treating disease” — something akin to the submarine in the 1966 classic sci-fi film<em> Fantastic Voyage</em>. As the shrunken sub entered and repaired the body of a sick scientist, commanders on the outside helped control it. “Similarly, we’re going to want to talk to the cells that we are going to send into the body to treat cancer, or inflammation, or neurological diseases,” Shapiro says.</p>



<p>Shapiro and his colleagues are working on <a href="http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/">building, watching and controlling</a> such cellular submarines in the real world. Such a deep view inside the body might offer clues to basic science questions, such as how communities of gut bacteria grow, how immune cells migrate through the body or how brains are built cell by cell.</p>



<p>Despite his futuristic visions, Shapiro is often drawn to the past. “I like science history a lot,” he says. Right now, he’s in the middle of rereading the Pulitzer Prize–winning <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em>. Just before that, he read a biography of Marie Curie.</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>“There is not a protein that I learn about that I don’t think about ways to misuse it,” Shapiro says. But he’s especially fond of the proteins that build the outer shell of gas vesicles in certain kinds of bacteria. These microscopic air bags “have so many uses that were totally unanticipated,” Shapiro says.</p>



<p>In addition to letting bacteria sink or float, these bubbles provide <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021">a communication system</a>, Shapiro and colleagues have found. Over the last several years, they have coaxed both bacterial cells and human cells to make gas vesicles and have placed such cells within mice. Because the air-filled pockets reflect sound, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6460/1469/tab-pdf">the engineered cells can be tracked</a> from outside a mouse’s body. Using patterns of sound waves, the researchers can also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/691105v1">drive bacterial cells around</a> in lab dishes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“There is not a protein that I learn about that I don’t think about ways to misuse it.”</p><cite>Mikhail Shapiro</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In another nod to <em>Fantastic Voyage</em>, scientists can weaponize these cellular submarines. “We’ve essentially turned cells into suicide agents triggered by ultrasound,” Shapiro says. This explosion could release chemicals into the surroundings and destroy nearby cells. This sort of targeted detonation could be damaging to tumors, for instance. “Complete warfare is possible,” he says.</p>



<p>By seeing the potential in these esoteric gas vesicles, Shapiro was “ahead of his time and hugely innovative,” says Jason Lewis, a molecular imaging scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “I think we’ve only scratched the surface of what his work will do in terms of a greater impact.”</p>



<h5>Motivation</h5>



<p>“Frustration,” Shapiro says, is what made him switch to engineering after studying neuroscience as an undergraduate at Brown University in Providence, R.I. He realized that existing tools for studying processes inside the brain fell short. “And I didn’t see enough people making better tools.”</p>



<p>But he didn’t stop at developing new neuroscience technologies. “Oddly enough, once I got into the engineering part of things, I got so fascinated with weird proteins, and magnetic fields, and sound waves, and all the more physics-y side of things. That’s become as much, if not more, of my passion as the original neuroscience.” In his Twitter bio, Shapiro describes his expertise as succinctly as possible: “Bio-Acousto-Magneto-Neuro-Chemical Engineer at Caltech.”  <em>— Laura Sanders</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="wang">Regeneration through an engineer’s eyes</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Bo Wang" class="wp-image-3091864" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_bw-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091864">Credit: Stanford Medicine</span></figure>



<h4>Bo Wang, 39<br />Bioengineer</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Stanford University<br />Hometown: Nanjing, China<br />Favorite organism: Planarian</p>



<h5>Inspiration</h5>



<p>Planarians are the most charismatic of all flatworms, Bo Wang says. “They have this childish cuteness that people just love.” But the adorable facade isn’t what drew Wang to study the deceptively simple worms, which resemble little arrows with eyes. It was planarians’ superpower: regeneration. Slice a planarian into pieces and, within a week or two, each chunk will grow into a new flatworm — head and all. Studying the cells that drive this process could offer lessons for turning on regeneration in human tissues, to treat various diseases, regrow limbs and grow organs for next-generation transplants.</p>



<h5>Bold idea</h5>



<p>Wang uses statistical physics to figure out how planarians regenerate entire organs cell by cell. Newly formed brain cells, for instance, must physically position themselves to avoid turning into “amorphous aggregates,” Wang says. His interest in how things fit together began in graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, Wang trained as a physicist and worked on self-assembling materials. Wang now works to uncover the physical rules that living cells follow. “I’m fascinated by how molecules arrange themselves seemingly randomly, but there are still statistical rules that those molecules will follow,” he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Bo Wang works to uncover the physical rules that living cells follow.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>His physics-based approach is raising new questions and unveiling biological processes that would be hard for biologists to come by using traditional methods alone, says regeneration biologist Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo. Wang is “a new breed” of flatworm biologist, Sánchez Alvarado says. “He is occupying a very unique niche in the community of developmental biology.”</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>Wang and colleagues recently found that nerve cells, or neurons, in regenerating planarian brains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0809-9">form a predictable pattern</a> dictated by the types of cells in their midst. Planarians brains are akin to cities made up of neighborhoods of neurons. Within each neighborhood, no two neurons that do the same job will live next to each other; those cells repulse each other but stay close enough to communicate, the researchers reported in the May <em>Nature Physics.</em> Because of this behavior, increasing the types of neurons in a neighborhood limits the ways cells can pack together. The team dubbed this packing process “chromatic jamming,” after a famous mathematical puzzle called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-color-problem-gets-sharp-new-hue">the four-color problem</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/09</em>).</p>



<p>The finding is surprising and challenges “what we think we understand about organogenesis and about organization of cells within an organ,” says Sánchez Alvarado. Chromatic jamming appears to be key to how the planarian brain comes together, guiding single cells into neighborhoods that are a driving force in organ development, he says. If similar physical rules apply to human cells, that could help scientists sketch blueprints for engineering and growing artificial organs.  <em>— Cassie Martin</em></p>

<h4>SaraH Zanders, 37<br />Geneticist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Stowers Institute for Medical Research<br />Hometown: Glenwood, Iowa<br />Favorite organism: Fission yeast</p>



<h5>Backstory</h5>



<p>An invitation to work in the lab of her genetics professor Robert Malone at the University of Iowa in Iowa City set SaraH Zanders on the path to becoming a scientist. “It was a turning point in my life,” Zanders says. Before that, she didn’t really know how she would put her biology degree to use, or what it meant to be a scientist. In Malone’s lab, she fell in love with meiosis, the process by which organisms divvy up genetic information to pass on to future generations. The first step is julienning the genome and swapping pieces of chromosomes. “That just seems like such a bad idea to basically shred your [DNA] in the process of getting it from one generation to the next,” she says. She started studying the proteins involved in making the cuts. “It was like I was born to do that. I never would have known without that push.”</p>



<p>A different kind of push led Zanders to spell her first name with a capital H: An elementary school teacher kept leaving the letter off. Zanders has capitalized it for emphasis ever since. “If I write it without the big H, it doesn’t look like my name anymore,” she says. “It feels like somebody else.”</p>



<h5>Standout research</h5>



<p>Meiosis is full of conflict. For her postdoctoral work, Zanders focused on a particular type of dustup caused by some selfish genes — genes that propagate themselves even if it hurts the host. As the monk Gregor Mendel laid out in his study of pea plants, a particular version of a gene typically has a 50-50 chance of being passed on to the next generation. But the selfish genes Zanders was studying, a type called meiotic drivers because they propel themselves during meiosis, manage to get themselves inherited far more often. “These kinds of systems do a complete end run around Mendel’s laws,” says Daniel Barbash, an evolutionary geneticist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>In <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em>, also called fission yeast, Zanders discovered, a family of selfish genes makes moves that would be right at home in a Game of Thrones story line. Zanders and colleagues were the first to work out the molecular tricks that thesegenes use to skirt Mendel’s laws, reporting the findings in <em>eLife</em> in 2017. The genes, known as <em>wtf</em> genes, produce both a poison and an antidote. All of the spores — the yeast’s gametes — get the poison, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/26033">but only those that inherit certain gene versions also get an antidote</a>. Spores that don’t get the antidote die, ensuring that only offspring with specific <em>wtf</em> gene versions survive to pass their genes on to the next generation. For the fission yeast, such predatory tactics can have big consequences, even driving two nearly identical strains toward becoming different species. Some selfish genes have made themselves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/junk-gene-may-be-important-embryo-development">essential for proper development</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/18</em>). In humans and other animals, genetic conflicts may lead to infertility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>For the fission yeast, such predatory tactics can have big consequences, even driving two nearly identical strains toward becoming different species.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“This extremely important family of meiotic cheaters has been just sitting in plain sight waiting for somebody who had the right kind of lens and the care … to discover them,” says Harmit Malik, an evolutionary geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Zanders’ postdoctoral mentor. Zanders helped build a case that the skewed inheritance in these yeast was a real effect, not just fluctuations in the data. Before she began her work, virtually nothing was known about meiotic drivers in yeast. Now the <em>wtf </em>genes are among the best known meiotic drivers studied in any lab organism. Some selfish genes in worms also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/selfish-genes-hide-decades-plain-sight-worm-geneticists">use the poison-antidote trick</a> to beat the competition (<em>SN: 5/11/17</em>). Meiotic drivers in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hybrids-reveal-barriers-successful-mating-between-species">fruit flies</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/selfish-dna-flouts-rules-inheritance">mice</a> — and maybe humans — win genetic conflicts by other means (<em>SN: 10/31/17; SN: 2/24/16</em>).</p>



<h5>Motivation</h5>



<p>Zanders is now on the lookout for other genetic fights in yeast. Understanding such conflicts more generally may help answer big questions in evolution, as well as shedding light on human infertility. As for what motivates her, “It’s just I like to solve puzzles,” Zanders laughs. “I wish it was a deep desire to help people, but it’s definitely not that.”  <em>— Tina Hesman Saey</em></p>

<h3 class="alignwide has-text-align-wide" id="zhan">Quake expert co-opts underground cables</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="Zhongwen Zhan" class="wp-image-3091871" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/101020_sn10_inline_zz-800x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3091871">Credit: Caltech</span></figure>



<h4>Zhongwen Zhan, 33<br />Seismologist</h4>



<p>Affiliation: Caltech<br />Hometown: Jinzhai County, China<br />Favorite hobby: Carpentry</p>



<h5>Big goal</h5>



<p>As the Rose Parade wound through Pasadena, Calif., on January 1, 2020, Zhongwen Zhan <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/91/4/2395/585373/Rose-Parade-Seismology-Signatures-of-Floats-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext">listened to the underground echoes</a> of the marching bands and dancers. With a sensitive technology known as distributed acoustic sensing, or DAS, Zhan tracked the parade’s progress. He even identified the most ground-shaking band. (It was the Southern University and A&amp;M College’s Human Jukebox.)</p>



<p>The study was a small but elegant proof of concept, revealing how DAS is capable of mapping out and distinguishing among small seismic sources that span just a few meters: zigzagging motorcycles, the heavy press of floats on the road, the steady pace of a marching band. But Zhan seeks to use the technology for bigger-picture scientific questions, including developing early warning systems for earthquakes, studying the forces that control the slow slide of glaciers and exploring seismic signals on other worlds.</p>



<p>Zhan has a “crystal-clear vision” of DAS’ scientific possibilities, says Nate Lindsey, a geophysicist at Stanford University who is also part of the small community of researchers exploring the uses of DAS. “When you get such a cool new tool, you like to just apply it to everything,” he adds. But Zhan’s expertise is “very deep, and it goes into many different areas. He knows what’s important.”</p>



<p>So far, Zhan and other researchers have used the technology to study aftershocks following <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-earthquakes-raise-questions-future-tectonic-activity">the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes</a> in Southern California (<em>SN: 7/12/19</em>), to demonstrate that interactions between ocean waves produce <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13262-7">tiny quakes beneath the North Sea</a>, and to examine <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL088148">the structure of glaciers</a>.</p>



<h5>Top tool</h5>



<p>DAS piggybacks off the millions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/underwater-fiber-optic-cables-could-moonlight-earthquake-sensors">fiber-optic cables</a> that run beneath the ground, ferrying data for internet service, phones and televisions (<em>SN: 6/14/18</em>). Not all of the glass cables are in use all of the time, and these strands of “dark fiber” can be temporarily repurposed as seismic sensors. When pulses of light are fired into the fibers’ ends, defects in the glass reflect the light back to its source. As vibrations within the Earth shift and stretch the fibers, a pulse’s travel time also shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Whole networks of seismic sensors could be deployed in places currently difficult or impossible to monitor — at the ocean bottom, atop Antarctic glaciers, on other planets.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Over the last few years, scientists have begun testing the effectiveness of these dark fibers as inexpensive, dense seismic arrays — which researchers call DAS — to help monitor earthquakes and create fine-scale images of the subsurface. In these settings, Zhan notes, DAS is proving to be a very useful supplement to existing seismograph networks. But the potential is far greater. Whole networks of sensors could be deployed in places currently difficult or impossible to monitor — at the bottom of the ocean, atop Antarctic glaciers, on other planets. “Seismology is a very observation-based field, so a seismic network is a fundamental tool,” he says.</p>



<h5>Inspiration</h5>



<p>“I’ve been interested in science since I was young, but wasn’t sure what kind of science I wanted to do,” Zhan says. In China, students usually have to decide on a field before they go to college, he adds, but “I was fortunate.” At age 15, Zhan was admitted to a special class for younger kids within the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. The program allowed him to try out different research fields. A nature lover, Zhan gravitated toward the earth sciences. “Environmental science, chemistry, atmospheric science — I tried all of them.”</p>



<p>Then, in late 2004, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-disaster-scientists-model-big-quake-and-its-consequences">magnitude 9.1 earthquake</a> ruptured the seafloor under the Indian Ocean, spawning deadly tsunamis (<em>SN: 1/5/05</em>). After hearing from a researcher studying the quake, Zhan knew he wanted to study seismology. “I was amazed by how seismologists can study very remote things by monitoring vibrations in the Earth,” Zhan says. The data “are just wiggles, complicated wiggles,” but so much info can be extracted. “And when we do it fast, it can provide a lot of benefit to society.”  <em>— Carolyn Gramling</em></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>As I write this post, I’m struggling a little to put words onto the page. I didn’t sleep well last night, and my tiredness has taken its toll on my ability to concentrate. But at least I’m sat at my desk at home and not, say, in control of a massive hunk of metal filled with fuel and electronics, hurtling through space at thousands of kilometres an hour. Because a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71929-4">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports </em>has found that astronauts need to get enough sleep too — and when they don’t, their performance suffers.</p>


<p><span id="more-40421"></span></p>


<p>Erin Flynn-Evans from NASA Ames Research Center and colleagues studied people taking part in a spaceflight simulation on Earth. They weren’t actually astronauts, but “astronaut-like” participants, who all met NASA’s physical standards for space flight, as well as other criteria (such as having Master’s degree in a STEM subject). The participants lived in the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/hera/">Human Analog Research Exploration (HERA) habitat</a>, a self-contained unit designed to mimic living and working conditions during space exploration. This paper included data from five separate “missions”, each of which involved four participants living together in the HERA habitat for 45 days (though one of the missions had to be cut short due to a hurricane).</p>



<p>Throughout each mission, the participants had a variety of tasks to complete, such as “extravehicular activities” and scientific work. Once every three days, at five points throughout the day, they also completed the psychomotor vigilance task, which simply involves watching a screen and pressing a button whenever a light randomly appears.</p>



<p>Importantly, each weekday participants were only allowed five hours of sleep; at the weekend they were allowed eight hours. They weren’t permitted to nap, and could only drink caffeine before 2pm. The researchers could therefore look at how performance on the psychomotor vigilance task changed across the course of the mission, as well as specifically on days when the “astronauts” got more or less sleep.</p>



<p>The team found that participants’ performance worsened as the mission went on, with reaction times on the task becoming slower. Interestingly, participants’ self-reported fatigue <em>didn’t</em> decline across the course of the mission, suggesting that tests like this may provide a better measure of performance than simply asking astronauts how they’re feeling. Participants were also slower and missed more of the lights in the task on days when they got only five hours of sleep, compared to days when they got eight hours.</p>



<p>Overall, the authors conclude, the findings “suggest that simply meeting the criteria required to be an astronaut is not in itself a determinant of resilience to chronic sleep restriction”. This isn’t entirely surprising — after all, astronauts are only human, and people in other professions with rigorous training requirements, such as pilots, are also adversely affected by lack of sleep.</p>



<p>Of course, there are some obvious limitations to the study: although it simulated a space mission, it was still conducted on Earth; similarly, the psychomotor vigilance task isn’t necessarily a good representation of the complex jobs astronauts need to perform. It’s also worth noting that the changes in reaction times on the task were pretty small, in the region of tens of milliseconds difference between the beginning and end of the missions, and there was lots of variation between participants. It would be interesting to explore these in more detail: are there particular characteristics that make astronauts’ performance more or less likely to suffer after a lack of sleep?</p>



<p>Still, the research does suggest that many days or weeks of poor sleep may build up to impair astronauts’ day-to-day functioning: an important insight given that this is the sort of time frame for future missions to the moon or beyond. And while NASA does allow crewmembers to sleep for eight hours per night on missions, astronauts themselves report actually sleeping for just six hours. So, the researchers say, it will be important to consider ways to promote better sleep while in space.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-most-massive-star-cluster-ate-smaller-cluster">The Milky Way’s most massive star cluster may have eaten a smaller cluster</a></h4>

<p>The Milky Way’s core harbors two giants: the galaxy’s largest black hole and a cluster of tens of millions of stars around the black hole that is denser and more massive than any other star cluster in the galaxy.</p>



<p>Most of the cluster’s many stars shine within just 20 light-years of the galactic center and all together weigh about 25 million times as much as the sun. New observations suggest that this “nuclear star cluster” owes some of its brilliance to another big group of stars, or even a small galaxy, that the main cluster swallowed.</p>



<p>Nuclear star clusters exist in many galaxies and are the densest star clusters in the universe. Astronomers are trying to figure out how these gatherings get so jam-packed and how they feed the giant black holes at the centers of galaxies.</p>



<p>To get a look at the Milky Way’s core, Tuan Do, an astronomer at UCLA, and colleagues observed about 700 red giant stars within five light-years of the galaxy’s heart. Because dust between Earth and the galactic center blocks the stars’ visible light, the astronomers studied infrared wavelengths, which better penetrate the dust.</p>





<p>“We noticed a very curious thing about our data, which is that the stars with less metals than our sun seem to be moving differently than the stars with more metals,” Do says.</p>



<p>About 7 percent of the stars in the nuclear star cluster revolve around the galactic center faster than their peers and do so around a different axis, the team found. The data on infrared wavelengths indicate that this fast-revolving population is only 30 percent as metal-rich as the sun. In contrast, most of the other stars in the nuclear star cluster have more metals than the sun.</p>



<p>“This discovery shows that at least some of our nuclear star cluster must have been formed from things falling in,” Do says. A <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb246">metal-poor star cluster thousands of light-years away</a> from the galactic core probably sank into the main star cluster, he and his colleagues report online September 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Do says the infalling star cluster was the victim of dynamical friction, a process that can alter a star cluster’s path through space. In this process, the orbiting star cluster’s gravity attracts material that forms a wake behind it. The backward tug of this material’s gravity then causes the cluster to plunge closer and closer to the galactic center.</p>



<p>Scott Tremaine, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who was not involved in the work, calls the team’s data on the nuclear cluster’s stars unique. “I think by far the most natural explanation is that [the stars] do come from a cluster that’s spiraled in,” he says.</p>



<p>In a companion study, team member Manuel Arca Sedda at Heidelberg University in Germany and colleagues ran computer models to simulate how a star cluster falling into the Milky Way’s nuclear star cluster could explain the new observations. These simulations indicate that such an event occurred less than 3 billion years ago, and that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb245">the devoured cluster was roughly a million times as massive as the sun</a>, the researchers report in a second study also published September 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>That mass is comparable to Omega Centauri, the Milky Way’s most massive globular cluster, a type of star grouping that’s dense but less extreme than nuclear star clusters. “It’s definitely a lot,” Do says. Just a dozen or so massive globular clusters could have populated the entire nuclear star cluster, he says.</p>



<p>Still, many of the nuclear star cluster’s other stars may have been born in place at the galactic center. And the scientists can’t rule out that the gobbled-up victim was a dwarf galaxy. Both dwarf galaxies and globular clusters can possess a similar number of stars. But their stars have different ratios of chemical elements, so future observations of the nuclear star cluster may be able to distinguish between the two scenarios.</p>

<p>The field of behavioral economics emerged in the 1970s from the confluence of psychology with human judgment and decision-making, grounded in the realization that humans don’t always act “rationally” or in their best interests. Real-word applications of behavioral economics are often focused on consumers and citizens, such as increasing the percentage of adults who receive influenza vaccinations or helping people save for retirement. However, the same decision-making biases that we wrestle with in our personal lives also show up in professional settings. In fact, our misguided assumptions of rationality and expertise in academia may actually make us <em>more</em> prone to cognitive biases than we think. So when making decisions on behalf of others in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure, it is even more important to protect against shortcuts and habits in our thinking.</p>



<p>Although recognizing personal biases is important, bias training that teaches individuals how to become more aware of decision-making tendencies has been shown to have a limited impact on actual behaviors. Instead, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674089037">creating new structural and institutional conditions</a> — in the parlance of behavioral economists, creating new “choice architectures” to scaffold decision-making processes — is often more effective when attempting to reduce bias in the interest of promoting and supporting more equitable practices.</p>



<p>While not a comprehensive set, we’ve identified <a href="https://sfdora.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DORA_UnintendendedCognitiveSystemBiases.pdf">four major barriers to equitable decision-making in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure processes that commonly result from biased thinking</a>. In the next 4 weeks we will provide examples of what these barriers are, the specific cognitive biases that feed them, and recommendations for overcoming these barriers at an institutional level. Part one delves into Objective comparisons.</p>



<p><strong>1. “Objective” comparisons are not necessarily equitable.</strong></p>



<p>Qualitative judgments are often notoriously difficult to make, in part because their “apples and oranges” nature makes it challenging to say a single option is truly better.This can lead to well-meaning efforts to reduce complexity, such as using proxies to simplify comparisons. While qualities that can be more easily measured or ranked are appealing because they feel less subjective, the temptation to rely on quantifiable indicators to signal quality has some <a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/">significant implications on </a><a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/">decision-making</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to oversimplifying options in an effort to make them more comparable, the urge to measure things can imbue measurability itself with outsized importance. But as <strong>Campbell’s Law</strong> has long made clear, once indicators are accepted as a way to gauge value, they start to lose meaning as objective measures. Instead, they increase the temptation to focus on a narrow set of activities and reduce investment in reviewing other meaningful, but less rewarded, achievements. Publishing research in venues with high Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) is a classic example: Due to the perceived importance of citations and “high-quality” publications in promotion and tenure dossiers, decisions about what research to conduct, submit, and publish can lead evaluators to prioritize research with a higher likelihood of getting published in the “right” journals over other forms of impact.</p>



<p>A second form of objectivity bias is the <strong>Matthew effect</strong>, which describes the tendency forresources to flow to those who already have them. This can occur when a lack of time or motivation to vet results means that decision-makers default to preconceived ideas about what seems good, such as when researchers with long track records of grants receive a disproportionate amount of new funding. Another example of the Matthew effect is when highly cited references become more cited in part becauseresearchers see that they’re highly cited, rather than because they are more relevant or higher quality. This tendency is more likely to increase as our reliance on automation as a means to customize or deliver content grows, such as in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464884920915374">social media</a> where popular items are more heavily promoted in newsfeeds or where items recommended by Amazon attract more hits.</p>



<p>Finally, the notion of <strong>anchoring</strong> — a cornerstone of early behavioral economics research, in which the first piece of data we see or hear defines the reference point against which subsequent data is compared — can create a false sense of objectivity and inadvertently emphasize relative comparisons between options rather than their actual values. For example, receiving a $2 million dollar grant one year may anchor one’s expectations for the value of future grants, causing a $1.2 million grant to feel comparatively disappointing. But anchoring can also manifest in a more general, qualitative context, such as when using one’s own personal life as an “anchor’ to judge others’ experiences.</p>



<p><em>What can institutions do?</em></p>



<p><strong>Contextualize data.</strong> Relying wholly on quantifiable measures can contribute to a false sense of objectivity. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12052">Structured interview and review protocols</a> can reduce inequities in review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) decision-making. Balancing the use of quantitative metrics with qualitative inputs, like narrative CV formats that capture more intangible qualities, can help create a counterweight by contextualizing data points.</p>



<p><strong>Diversify standards.</strong> The temptation to anchor on old assumptions of what good researcher performance looks like often arises out of habit. To counter the urge to use a narrow or an anecdotal set of data that emphasize legacy notions of importance, institutions and decision-makers can elicit and select standards gathered from a wider set of sources and based on a more holistic set of values.</p>



<p><strong>Balance quantitative and qualitative measures.</strong> The human tendency to bend our behaviors to meet quantifiable targets is stronger than we think. Institutions should actively identify and recognize where setting specific, quantifiable goals may reinforce some behaviors at the expense of others. Institutions should make sure that what is being measured adheres to organizational or disciplinary goals and values, like achieving real-world impact, rather than what is easiest to measure, such as university rankings.</p>



<p>Next Monday we’ll tackle how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How can you discourage kids from copying each other on tests? You could always use a simple frame to separate them, or even a ruler to draw an imaginary line between their desks. When these behavioural “nudge” techniques were used in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19101.short?rss=1">new research</a> published in <em>Current Directions in Psychological Scienc</em>e, they significantly reduced cheating among 5 to 6-year-olds. This shows “that even seemingly unremarkable features of children’s environments can nudge them to act honestly,” write the researchers, led by Li Zhao at Hangzhou Normal University in China.</p>


<p><span id="more-40415"></span></p>


<p>The team set out to explore the extent to which a physical, spatial barrier might also act as a barrier against moral transgressions. In each of a series of four studies, a child was seated a small table and given a set of counting problems, which were impossible to complete in the allotted time. A short distance away was another identical table, on which the experimenter put the answer sheet before leaving the room. Though all the children were instructed not to cheat, from a purely practical perspective, it was easy to do so. In fact, in the control conditions, when there was no barrier (real or imaginary) between the child’s table and the answers, hidden cameras showed that about half did indeed look at the answers.</p>



<p>However, the team found that a barrier of some sort did make a difference. In the first study, a metal frame either fitted with transparent plastic cheating or simply left empty was placed between the tables. In both scenarios, the child could easily see the answers if they wanted to — but the frame with the sheeting cut the cheating rate to about 15%, while the empty frame reduced cheating to just under 30%.</p>



<p>In the second and third studies, the team moved the barrier into a variety of positions around the tables. They found that to reduce cheating, the barrier had to be in the child’s eye line when they looked towards the other table.</p>



<p>In the fourth study, there was no physical barrier at all. Instead, before leaving the room, the experimenter used a toy magic wand to outline what she said was an “invisible frame” between the tables. This imaginary barrier was about as effective as the empty frame was in the first study at reducing cheating.</p>



<p>Why did a simple frame, and even an imaginary frame, reduce cheating? One possibility, the researchers say, is that from a very young age, children learn to use environmental cues to guide their movements. So, for example, they might learn that while it’s okay to play football in an open park, it’s not okay to pass through a gate in a neighbour’s fence, to play football in their garden. It’s possible that children generalised this type of learning, viewing the barriers as dividers between a permissible space and a prohibited space.</p>



<p>In English, of course, we even talk about “crossing the line” between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. (I seem to tell my children that they’ve crossed the line on an almost daily basis.) These were Chinese children. I don’t know if Mandarin has the equivalent metaphor, but if it does, this might have influenced their children’s behaviour — or, if the study were to be replicated in an English-speaking country, perhaps cheating might be reduced still further.</p>



<p>As the team notes, though the frame was always in place when the child sat down, and the experimenter didn’t even refer to it (except for when it was imaginary), the children may well have made the implicit assumption that someone had put it there for a reason — presumably to stop them from cheating. So kids’ ability to tap into this sort of social cue could be part of the reason why they were less inclined to cheat.</p>



<p>This study was on young children. Would a physical barrier have the same impact on cheating in older kids? In this study, older children had a higher rate of cheating than younger children (no matter what the experimental condition) — but the frames were just as effective at <em>reducing</em> cheating, no matter what the child’s age. So it’s possible that older children would be susceptible to the frame effect, too.  </p>



<p>More work is clearly needed to examine the specific mechanisms that underlie the new findings, and to explore just how barriers might be used in real classrooms and exam halls.</p>

<p>What could be more 2020 than an ongoing invasion of jumping worms?</p>



<p>These earthworms are wriggling their way across the United States, voraciously devouring protective forest leaf litter and leaving behind bare, denuded soil. They displace other earthworms, centipedes, salamanders and ground-nesting birds, and disrupt forest food chains. They can invade more than five hectares in a single year, changing soil chemistry and microbial communities as they go, new research shows. And they don’t even need mates to reproduce.</p>



<p>Endemic to Japan and the Korean Peninsula, three invasive species of these worms — <em>Amynthas agrestis, A. tokioensis </em>and<em> Metaphire hilgendorfi</em> — have been in the United States for over a century. But just in the past 15 years, they’ve <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/earthworms-can-these-gardeners-friends-actually-become-foes">begun to spread widely</a> (<em>SNS: 10/7/16</em>). Collectively known as Asian jumping worms, crazy worms, snake worms or Alabama jumpers, they’ve become well established across the South and Mid-Atlantic and have reached parts of the Northeast, Upper Midwest and West.</p>



<p>Jumping worms are often sold as compost worms or fishing bait. And that, says soil ecologist Nick Henshue of the University at Buffalo in New York, is partially <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-species-are-growing-global-threat">how they’re spreading</a> (<em>SN: 11/5/17</em>). Fishers like them because the worms wriggle and thrash like angry snakes, which lures fish, says Henshue. They’re also marketed as compost worms because they gobble up food scraps far faster than other earthworms, such as nightcrawlers and other <em>Lumbricus</em> species.</p>





<p>But when it comes to ecology, the worms have more worrisome traits. Their egg cases, or cocoons, are so small that they can easily hitch a ride on a hiker’s or gardener’s shoe, or can be transported in mulch, compost or shared plants. Hundreds can exist within a square meter of ground.  </p>



<p>Compared with <em>Lumbricus</em> worms, jumping worms grow faster and reproduce faster — and without a mate, so one worm can create a whole invasion. Jumping worms also consume more nutrients than other earthworms, turning soil into dry granular pellets that resemble coffee grounds or ground beef — Henshue calls it “taco meat.” This can make the soil inhospitable to native plants and tree seedlings and far more likely to erode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Asian jumping worm species thrash furiously, unlike the more placid movements of other earthworm species. The jumping worms can also slime and shed their tails as defense mechanisms.</figure>



<p>To date, scientists have worried most about the worms’ effects on ground cover. Prior to a jumping worm invasion, the soft layer of decomposing leaves, bark and sticks covering the forest floor might be more than a dozen centimeters thick. What’s left afterward is bare soil with a different structure and mineral content, says Sam Chan, an invasive species specialist with Oregon Sea Grant at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Worms can reduce leaf litter by 95 percent in a single season, he says.</p>



<p>That in turn can reduce or remove the forest understory, providing less nutrients or protection for the creatures that live there or for seedlings to grow. Eventually, different plants come in, usually invasive, nonnative species, says Bradley Herrick, an ecologist and research program manager at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum. And now, new research shows the worms are also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071720302510#!">changing the soil chemistry and the fungi, bacteria and microbes</a> that live in the soils.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Forest leaf litter before and after jumping worm activity" class="wp-image-3091898" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092420_ms_jumping-worm_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091898">Invasive jumping worms can clear a forest of leaf litter in just a couple of months, as these pictures taken in Jacobsburg State Park near Nazareth, Pa., in June 2016 (left) and August 2016 (right) show.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091898">Nick Henshue</span></figure>



<p>In a study in the October <em>Soil Biology and Biochemistry</em>, Herrick, soil scientist Gabriel Price-Christenson and colleagues tested samples from soils impacted by jumping worms. They were looking for changes in carbon and nitrogen levels and in soils’ release of carbon dioxide, which is produced by the metabolism of microbes and animals living in the soil. Results showed that the longer the worms had lived in the soils, the more the soils’ basal metabolic rate increased — meaning soils invaded by jumping worms could release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, says Price-Christenson, who is at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>



<p>Relative amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soils with jumping worms also shifted, the team found. That can affect plant communities, Herrick says. For example, although nitrogen is a necessary nutrient, if there’s too much, or it’s available at the wrong time of year, plants or other soil organisms won’t be able to use it. </p>



<p>The team also extracted DNA from worm poop and guts to examine differences in microbes among the jumping worm species, and tested the soils for bacterial and fungal changes. Each jumping worm species harbors a different collection of microbes in its gut, the results showed. That’s “a really important find,” Herrick says, “because for a long time, we were talking about jumping worms as a large group … but now we’re learning that [these different species] have different impacts on the soil, which will likely cascade down to having different effects on other worms, soil biota, pH and chemistry.”  </p>



<p>The finding suggests each species might have a unique niche in the environment, with gut microbes breaking down particular food sources. This allows multiple species to invade and thrive together, Herrick says. This makes sense, given findings of multiple species together, but it’s still a surprise that such similar worms would have different niches, he says.    </p>



<p>Scientists have been working hard to get a good handle on the biology of these worms, Henshue says. So the newly discovered soil chemistry and microbiology changes are “thoughtful” and important lines of research. But there’s still a lot that’s unknown, making it hard to predict how much farther the worms might spread and into what kinds of environments. One important question is how weather conditions affect the worms. For example, a prolonged drought this year in Wisconsin seems to have killed off many of the worms, Herrick says. Soils teeming with wriggling worms just a few weeks ago now hold far fewer.</p>



<p>Perhaps that’s a hopeful sign that even these hardy worms have their limits, but in the meantime, the onslaught of worms continues its march — with help from the humans who spread them.</p>

<p><strong>Clues from a chemical</strong> <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/clues-chemical"><em>Science News</em></a><em>, </em>October 3, 1970</p>



<p>An experimental drug’s effects on the sexual behavior of certain animals is arousing interest among investigators.… The drug, para-chlorophenylalanine … reduces the level of a naturally occurring neurochemical, serotonin, in the brain of rats, mice and dogs.… Little is known about how serotonin acts in the brain, and investigators quickly recognized that PCPA could be used to study this brain chemical.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>PCPA helped e­stablish serotonin’s role in regulating sexual desire, as well as sleep, appetite and mood. The chemical messenger has become key to one common class of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin r­euptake inhibitors. Identified in 1974, SSRIs work by increasing the brain’s serotonin levels. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/body-brain-23">But such drugs can hinder sexual desire</a>. One SSRI that failed to relieve depression in humans found a second life as a treatment for sexual dysfunction.

<p class="">The putamen is a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> structure that is part of a group of structures known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia" target="_blank">basal ganglia</a>. It is also a component of the dorsal <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/striatum" target="_blank">striatum</a>, which includes the putamen and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/caudate" target="_blank">caudate nucleus</a>. The putamen is adjacent to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a>, and the putamen and globus pallidus together are sometimes referred to as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lentiform-nucleus" target="_blank">lentiform or lenticular nucleus</a>. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the putamen and what does it do?</h2><p class="">As a component of the basal ganglia, the putamen is best known for its role in facilitating movement. To understand the putamen’s role in movement, it’s helpful to think about how the basal ganglia as a whole may contribute to movement. While this has not been determined definitively, one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia are important for facilitating desired movements while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia" target="_blank">this article</a>. </p><p class="">Watch this 2-Minute Neuroscience video to learn more about the basal ganglia.</p><p class="">The putamen (and striatum as a whole) is thought to act as a critical input area for the basal ganglia. In other words, to accomplish their movement-related functions, the basal ganglia need to receive information from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a> about movements that you want to make. Much of this information travels first to the putamen or the caudate via a pathway called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticostriatal-pathway" target="_blank">corticostriatal pathway</a>. </p><p class="">Most of the neurons in the putamen contain the neurotransmitter <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba" target="_blank">GABA</a> and extend out of the putamen to other regions of the basal ganglia— specifically the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a> and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>. These neurons that leave the putamen create pathways that are thought to be involved in either the facilitation or inhibition of movements (depending on the pathway). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9004351/" target="_blank">Research suggests that neurons in the putamen are activated before and during movement</a>—especially movement of the limbs and torso. It is thought that the firing of these putamen neurons contributes not only to the initiation of a movement, but also to the decision to make a movement and the selection of a movement to make.</p><p class="">For years, the putamen was considered to be primarily devoted to movement. But more recent research has begun to point to an expanded role for the putamen. For example, it is now thought that that the putamen is also involved with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12052921/" target="_blank">learning and memory</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28585051/" target="_blank">language</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569212/" target="_blank">emotion</a>. </p><p class="">Dysfunction in the putamen could be a factor in a number of disorders, but is strongly linked to problems with motor function. <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/huntingtons-disease" target="_blank">Huntington’s disease</a> (HD), for example—which is characterized by rapid and spasmodic involuntary movements—is associated with<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529157" target="_blank"> the degeneration and death of neurons in the caudate and putamen</a>. These neurons may be involved with the inhibition of unwanted movements, and their degeneration in HD may cause involuntary movement to be more difficult to suppress. </p><p class=""><a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neurodegeneration" target="_blank">Neurodegeneration</a> in the basal ganglia is also the hallmark pathological sign of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a> (PD), a condition that causes slow, labored movement along with tremors (among other symptoms). With PD, the neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>, but other areas of the basal ganglia—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641567" target="_blank">like the putamen</a>—are also affected. Additionally, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30465864/" target="_blank">abnormalities in dopamine function in the putamen</a> are thought to contribute to the movement problems PD patients experience.</p><h3><br /><br />References<strong> </strong>(in addition to linked text above)<strong>:</strong></h3><p class="">Mink JW.

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs: a space for community innovation</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon.png"><img alt="Image of arXiv smiley bones flask" class="wp-image-682 size-medium alignright" height="300" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-272x300.png" width="272" /></a>arXiv has launched a new, formalized framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.</p>
<p>arXivLabs, a concept developed years ago, acts as a conduit for collaboration. Now, it appears as a physical space on the article record page, and, importantly, sets guidelines for collaborations between arXiv and third parties, ensuring that partners share arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.</p>
<p>“The arXivLabs framework complements other collaborative projects such as <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/">arXiv’s Kaggle dataset</a>,” said Presani, “and demonstrates how great results are achieved when the community works together.”</p>
<p>arXiv readers will now find a new feature, below existing content on the article record page, that reflects the new framework. The arXivLabs tabs highlight different experimental tools developed by collaborators, and will be updated as new tools become available. These add value and functionality for both readers and authors.</p>
<p>For example, the Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. This enables discovery of relevant research by providing user-friendly navigation of an article’s citation tree. The Explorer, developed by Matt Bierbaum, was already available on the site, and will now be featured in the “Bibliographic Tools” tab.</p>
<p>Another tool, the CORE Recommender, facilitates the exploration of relevant open access papers from a global network of research repositories and is now accessible on the “Recommenders” tab.</p>
<p><a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXiv’s third party collaborators</a> will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request, this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-south-pole-ice-surrounded-pools-water">A ‘lake’ on Mars may be surrounded by more pools of water</a></h4>

<p>Fresh intel from Mars is sure to stir debate about whether liquid water lurks beneath the planet’s polar ice.</p>



<p>New data from a probe orbiting Mars appear to bolster <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid-water-search-life">a claim from 2018</a> that a lake sits roughly 1.5 kilometers beneath ice near the south pole (<em>SN: 8/18/18</em>). An analysis of the additional data, by some of the same researchers who reported the lake’s discovery, also hint at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1200-6">several more pools encircling the main reservoir</a>, a study released online September 28 in <em>Nature Astronomy </em>claims.</p>



<p>If it exists, the central lake spans roughly 600 square kilometers. To keep from freezing, the water would have to be extremely salty, possibly making it similar to subglacial lakes in Antarctica. “This area is the closest thing to ‘habitable’ on Mars that has been found so far,” says Roberto Orosei, a planetary scientist at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Bologna, Italy, who also led the 2018 report.</p>



<p>Ali Bramson, a planetary scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., agrees “something funky is going on at this location.” But, she says, “there are some limitations to the instrument and the data…. I don’t know if it’s totally a slam dunk yet.”</p>





<p>Orosei and colleagues probed the ice using radar on board the European Space Agency’s <a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express">Mars Express</a> orbiter. Short bursts of radio waves reflect off the ice, but some penetrate deeper and bounce off the bottom of the ice, sending back a second echo. The brightness and sharpness of that second reflection can reveal details about the underlying terrain.</p>



<p>The possible lake was originally found using radar data collected from May 2012 to December 2015. Now, in data collected from 2010 to 2019, the team once again found regions beneath the ice that are highly reflective and very flat. They say their findings not only confirm earlier hints of a large buried lake but also unearth a handful of smaller ponds encircling the main body of water and separated by strips of dry land.</p>



<p>“On Earth, there would be no debate” that a bright, flat radar reflection would be liquid water, Orosei says. These same analysis techniques have been used closer to home to map subglacial lakes in Antarctica and Greenland.</p>



<p>While much about these putative ponds remains unknown, one thing is certain: This new report is bound to spark controversy. “The community is very polarized,” says Isaac Smith, a planetary scientist with the Planetary Science Institute who is based in Ontario, Canada. “I’m in the camp that leans towards believing it,” he adds. “They’ve done their homework.”</p>



<p>One question centers on how water could stay liquid. “There’s no way to get liquid water warm enough even with throwing in a bunch of salts,” says planetary scientist Michael Sori, also at Purdue.</p>



<p>In 2019, he and Bramson calculated that the ice temperature — about –70° Celsius — is too cold even for salts to melt. They argue <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL080985">some local source of geothermal heat is needed</a>, such as a magma chamber beneath the surface, to maintain a lake. That in turn has led to other questions about whether contemporary Mars could supply the necessary heat.</p>



<p>Smith — as well as the paper’s authors — thinks this isn’t a problem. As recently as 50,000 years ago, Smith says, the Martian south pole was warmer because the planet’s tilt (and hence its seasons) is constantly changing. Warmer temperatures could have propagated through the ice to create pockets of salty liquid. Alternatively, the ponds may have been there before the ice cap formed. Either way, at very high salt concentrations, once water has melted, it’s hard to get it to freeze again. “The melting temperature is different than the freezing temperature,” he says.</p>



<p>Even so, such liquid may be unlike any that most earthlings are familiar with. “Some supercooled brines at these cold temperatures are still considered liquid but turn into some weird glass,” Bramson says.</p>



<p>Resolving these questions will probably require more than radar. Multiple factors, such as the composition and physical properties of the ice, can alter the fate of the second echo from the bottom of the ice, says Bramson. Seismology, gravity and topography data could go a long way to revealing what lurks beneath the ice.</p>



<p>Whether anything could survive in such water is an open question. “We don’t know exactly what is in this water,” Orosei says.  “We don’t know the concentration of salts, which could be deadly to life.” But if life did evolve on Mars, he speculates, “these lakes could have been providing a Noah’s Ark that could have allowed life to survive even in in present conditions.“</p>

<p>This post was written by Alexia A., Hannah Dee, Karel Green, Alison Young and Yolanda Ohene from Scientists are Humans and Rebecca Kirk from PLOS <br /></p>



<p>Kindness matters, in life generally, but also in the research environment. This simple concept was behind the launch two years ago of the website <a href="https://scientistsarehumans.com/">Scientists Are Humans</a>, with the aim to support scientists to move the research culture to be more kind; with the aim to change the game. We want to amplify even more voices on the site, including yours, so please get in <a href="https://scientistsarehumans.com/want-to-support-scientists-are-humans/">touch </a>to share your story (we are flexible about format and posts can be anonymous).</p>



<p>The website was one outcome of the <a href="https://stemgamechangers.github.io/">Gamechangers for diversity in STEM</a> (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) event in London run at the Turing Institute. This two-day workshop initiated and fostered projects to support more diversity in STEM. The concept of Scientists Are Humans is that the challenges faced by minorities in STEM could be ameliorated with more understanding and more kindness. One of the ways we can build understanding is by telling our stories, and listening kindly when others tell their stories. </p>



<p>So why is kindness so important? A look at the content of the website quickly makes it clear how it can make a huge difference. In the past two years the website published articles reporting from picket lines, about the BLM movement, on leaving academia, on struggling and completing PhDs, on being an ally, on mental health and on being brave – amongst many others. The variety of voices, and the clarity with which they speak has been inspiring, thought provoking and has humanized the science and scientists.</p>



<p>The importance of our <a href="https://scientistsarehumans.com/manifesto/">manifesto </a>for being more kind could not be more important as we all find our own ways to manage the particular challenges that we are facing at the moment. We all need to be more kind, and we will all benefit from a profession with kindness at its core.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2RWeO46">Schrödinger’s Web</a><br /><em>Jonathan P. Dowling</em><br /><em>CRC Press, $40.95</em></p>



<p>When news broke last year that Google’s quantum computer Sycamore had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-supremacy-claim-controversy-top-science-stories-2019-yir">performed a calculation faster than the fastest supercomputers</a> could (<em>SN:</em> <em>12/16/19</em>), it was the first time many people had ever heard of a quantum computer.</p>



<p>Quantum computers, which harness the strange probabilities of quantum mechanics, may prove revolutionary. They have the potential to achieve an exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, at least when it comes to solving some problems. But for now, these computers are still in their infancy, useful for only a few applications, just as the first digital computers were in the 1940s. So isn’t a book about the communications network that will link quantum computers — the quantum internet — more than a little ahead of itself?</p>





<p>Surprisingly, no. As theoretical physicist Jonathan Dowling makes clear in <em>Schrödinger’s</em> <em>Web</em>, early versions of the quantum internet are here already — for example, quantum communication has been taking place between Beijing and Shanghai via fiber-optic cables since 2016 — and more are coming fast. So now is the perfect time to read up.</p>



<p>Dowling, who helped found the U.S. government’s quantum computing program in the 1990s, is the perfect guide. Armed with a seemingly endless supply of outrageous anecdotes, memorable analogies, puns and quips, he makes the thorny theoretical details of the quantum internet both entertaining and accessible.</p>



<p>Readers wanting to dive right in to details of the quantum internet will have to be patient. “Photons are the particles that will power the quantum internet, so we had better be sure we know what the heck they are,” Dowling writes. Accordingly, the first third of the book is a historical overview of light, from Newton’s 17th century idea of light as “corpuscles” to experiments probing the quantum reality of photons, or particles of light, in the late 20th century. There are some small historical inaccuracies — the section on the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted repeats an apocryphal tale about his “serendipitous” discovery of the link between electricity and magnetism — and the footnotes rely too much on Wikipedia. But Dowling accomplishes what he sets out to do: Help readers develop an understanding of the quantum nature of light.</p>





<p>Like Dowling’s 2013 book on quantum computers, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439896739?ie=UTF8">Schrödinger’s Killer App</a></em>, <em>Schrödinger’s Web </em>hammers home the nonintuitive truths at the heart of quantum mechanics. For example, key to the quantum internet is entanglement — that “spooky action at a distance” in which particles are linked across time and space, and measuring the properties of one particle instantly reveals the other’s properties. Two photons, for instance, can be entangled so they always have the opposite polarization, or angle of oscillation.</p>



<p>In the future, a user in New York could entangle two photons and then send one along a fiber-optic cable to San Francisco, where it would be received by a quantum computer. Because these photons are entangled, measuring the New York photon’s polarization would instantly reveal the San Francisco photon’s polarization. This strange reality of entanglement is what the quantum internet exploits for neat features, such as unhackable security; any eavesdropper would mess up the delicate entanglement and be revealed.<br />While his previous book contains more detailed explanations of quantum mechanics, Dowling still finds amusing new analogies, such as “Fuzz Lightyear,” a canine that runs along a superposition, or quantum combination, of two paths into neighbors’ yards. Fuzz helps explain physicist John Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment, which illustrates the uncertainty, unreality and nonlocality of the quantum world.

<p>The complexities of the quantum web are saved for last, and even with Dowling’s help, the details are not for the faint of heart. Readers will learn how to prepare <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-experiment-verifies-quantum-spookiness">Bell tests</a> to check that a system of particles is entangled (<em>SN: 8/28/15</em>), navigate bureaucracy in the Department of Defense and send unhackable quantum communications with the dryly named BB84 and E91 protocols. Dowling also goes over some recent milestones in the development of a quantum internet, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-video-chat-links-scientists-two-different-continents">2017 quantum-secured videocall</a> between scientists in China and Austria via satellite (<em>SN: 9/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>“Just like the classical internet, we really won’t figure out what the quantum internet is useful for until it is up and running,” Dowling writes, so people can start “playing around with it.” Some of his prognostications seem improbable. Will people really have quantum computers on their phones and exchange entangled photons across the quantum internet?</p>



<p>Dowling died unexpectedly in June at age 65, before he could see this future come to fruition. Once when I interviewed him, he invoked Arthur C. Clarke’s first law to justify why he thought another esteemed scientist was wrong. “The first law is that if a distinguished, elderly scientist tells you something is possible, he’s very likely right,” he said. “If he tells you something is impossible, he’s very likely wrong.”<br /><br />Dowling died too soon to be considered elderly, but he was distinguished, and <em>Schrödinger’s Web </em>lays out a powerful case for the possibility of a quantum internet.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-motion-experiment-reveals-supercooled-water-dual-nature">A stop-motion experiment reveals supercooled water’s dual nature</a></h4>

<p>Supercooled water may be a two-for-one deal.</p>



<p>A long-standing theory holds that liquid water at temperatures well below freezing is composed of two different arrangements of molecules, one with high density and one with low density. Now, an experiment <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb7542">provides new evidence for that theory</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Typically, water freezes below 0° Celsius thanks to impurities, such as dust in the water, on which ice crystals can nucleate. But pure water, which lacks those crystallization kick starters, can remain liquid to much lower temperatures, a phenomenon called supercooling.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, a group of physicists proposed that, at high pressures and very low temperatures, supercooled water splits into two distinct liquids of different densities. At atmospheric pressure, under which the new experiment took place, supercooled water would retain some traces of that behavior, resulting in small-scale, transient arrangements of molecules in high-density and low-density formations. Normal liquids have only one such arrangement, rather than two.</p>





<p>Although experiments have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooled-liquid-water-hits-record-low">hinted at this effect</a>, scientists haven’t been able to fully pin it down (<em>SN: 6/18/14</em>). “There’s a temperature region where [supercooled water is] just experimentally very difficult to look at,” says Loni Kringle of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash.</p>



<p>Between about –113° C and –38° C, the liquid crystallizes extremely rapidly, even if it’s entirely pure. That makes teasing out its properties difficult, as measurements must be made in the fraction of a second before the water freezes.</p>



<p>Now, Kringle and colleagues have glimpsed that murky temperature regime with an experiment that works a bit like a stop-motion movie. They heated a thin film of water using a laser and then rapidly cooled the liquid. Hitting the film with infrared light revealed how the water molecules jostled around, hinting at the water’s structure. The team then repeated this process to take snapshots of how that structure evolved over time as the film was heated and cooled. That let the scientists measure the properties of the liquid at temperatures at which it would quickly crystallize if held there for longer periods of time.</p>



<p>The researchers conclude that the water’s behavior as it was heated and cooled could be explained by the coexistence of two different molecular arrangements, as previously predicted. However, the team hasn’t directly measured the density of those structures, so more work is still needed to confirm whether the theory is correct.</p>



<p>“The combination of techniques is quite new and original,” says chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of Princeton University, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Better understanding the strange properties of supercooled water might help scientists understand water’s quirks. For example, unlike most substances, water expands when it freezes, making it less dense than its liquid form. That’s the reason why ice floats in your cup and why it sits atop a lake, leaving a liquid layer underneath that can shelter aquatic life over the winter.</p>



<p>“Water is a very strange liquid,” says physicist Greg Kimmel, a coauthor of the study, also at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  “But everybody’s familiar with it, so we don’t really realize how weird it is.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>In popular culture, there’s an idea that lots of successful people are… well, not that nice. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM"><em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em></a> to <em>The Apprentice, </em>there’s a litany of bad bosses and aggressive success stories in film and television. The message seems to be that to get ahead you need to ditch the niceties and think about number one.</p>



<p>This stereotype might not reflect what’s really going on, however. In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/37/22780">new longitudinal study</a> published in <em>PNAS, </em>a team from the University of California, Berkeley and Colby College tracked individuals over a fourteen year period, looking to see what became of those who were more disagreeable (not a cohort many of us would particularly long to be in).</p>



<p>They found that selfish, combative, and manipulative people have no real advantage at work — not because there are no benefits to such behaviour, but because its positive and negative impacts cancel each other out.</p>


<p><span id="more-40407"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, Cameron Anderson and colleagues measured the Big Five personality traits of 457 participants during their university years. Then fourteen years later, when those participants were in the workforce, the team assessed participants’ power in the organisation, their view of their influence in the workplace, and organisational culture — how aggressive, criticising, political or selfish a participant felt it was.</p>



<p>Those who were most disagreeable at the first measurement did <em>not</em> have more power at the second, regardless of their age, gender or ethnicity — suggesting that selfishness and aggression do not result in higher levels of power or attainment.</p>



<p>In the second study, the team looked more closely at workplace behaviours in another group which had been followed in a similar way. Behaviours were grouped into four categories: dominant behaviour (e.g. “I am willing to bully others to achieve important goals”), political behaviour (e.g. “I build alliances with important people”), communal behaviour (e.g. “I care about others’ wellbeing”) and competent behaviour (e.g. “I make important contributions to my team’s success”). Importantly, coworkers also rated participants on these same workplace behaviours, as well power and organisational rank.</p>



<p>Coworker ratings largely agreed not only with one another but also with participants’ own ratings of themselves, suggesting that self-insight was fairly accurate. And the results showed that those who engaged in more dominant, political, communal <em>and</em> competent behaviour had higher levels of power. Personality-wise, people who were more extraverted 14 years previously engaged more in each of these categories, doing “everything right”, as the team put it, to attain higher power. Those with disagreeable personalities, however, only engaged in more dominant behaviours — and <em>fewer</em> communal ones.</p>



<p>So whilst dominant behaviour might get you ahead in some ways, it’s clear that other, more prosocial, types of behaviour are also a key part of the process. If you’re a disagreeable person, being selfish might enhance your power to some extent, but failing to be generous and kind can cancel this out.</p>



<p>This might not be the case, however, in certain environments — if you work in an industry where prosocial behaviour is neither valued nor particularly useful, disagreeable people may be more likely to reach positions of power.</p>



<p>Future research could take the opposite approach: do people become more selfish and disagreeable once they’re in positions of power, and do those kinds of traits help them keep it? It may be that power really does corrupt — or we might find that it’s mere tropes around aggression that perpetuate the myth that nice guys finish last.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/37/22780">People with disagreeable personalities (selfish, combative, and manipulative) do not have an advantage in pursuing power at work</a></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-genetics-immune-responses-severe-cases">Defects in early immune responses underlie some severe COVID-19 cases</a></h4>

<p>COVID-19 kills some people and leaves others relatively unscathed. But why? Age and underlying health conditions are risk factors, but scientists are trying to tease out other differences, including in people’s genes or immune systems, that may play a role.</p>



<p>Two new studies show that flaws in the body’s early response to viral infection, one caused by genetic defects and one by traitorous immune responses, are behind some severe COVID-19 cases.</p>



<p>In one study, published online September 24 in <em>Science, </em>researchers identified certain <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/09/23/science.abd4570">genetic defects</a> in some people with severe COVID-19 that make the body produce fewer interferons, proteins that are part of the immune system’s early warning system. In other people with severe disease, however, the body’s own <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/09/23/science.abd4585">immune responses</a> disable interferons, a second study published online in <em>Science</em> the same day finds.</p>



<p>These defects mean that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, can infect cells without raising red flags, evading the usual onslaught of defenses brought on by interferons and leading to more severe disease, the researchers say.</p>

<p>The results add to growing evidence that strong <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-immune-responses-young-people-covid19-coronavirus">early immune responses</a> to COVID-19 are crucial to protect people from becoming severely ill (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). The findings may eventually lead to treatments that can better help those people who do get very sick, says Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University in Madison, N.J., who was not involved in either study.</p>



<p>But “it’s really clear here that we can look at our severe patients and see that there’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all kind of treatment for them,” Barker says. For instance, while people with the genetic defects might benefit from receiving additional interferon early during an infection to boost their levels, those whose immune systems are going to mount a defense against the proteins would not.</p>



<p>It’s known that an overactive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can do more harm than help. People with serious symptoms tend to have high levels of immune proteins linked to inflammation, a sign that the immune system failed to control the virus early during infection and is overcompensating in an effort to get it under control.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">Interferons</a> are a key part of the body’s early warning system (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). They alert uninfected cells that a virus of any type has invaded the body. In response to interferons, cells crank up protection measures that aim to curb viral replication. But in a minority of people with life-threatening COVID-19, there was a problem with that alarm system, the studies found.</p>



<p>“For [the researchers] to have found evidence of interferon being important in 14 percent of their severe patients is huge,” Barker says. It’s incredible to see one factor play such a large role in an infectious disease.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, infectious diseases geneticist Jean-Laurent Casanova and colleagues analyzed the genetic blueprints of 364 patients who had been hospitalized with severe COVID-19. From another 295 critically ill people, the researchers examined smaller pieces of DNA that together form genetic messengers that help make proteins. For comparison, the team also analyzed 534 mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic people.</p>



<p>Of those 659 severely ill patients, 23 people had defects in immune genes that are involved in viral defense. Typically, the identified genes — known to play a role in life-threatening pneumonia caused by influenza — produce proteins that sense viral invaders or alert immune cells to begin making interferons. But flaws in some patients’ genetic code yield proteins that don’t work properly, causing the body to produce fewer interferons than usual. Experiments on cells in lab dishes and measuring interferon levels in blood show that people with these genetic defects didn’t produce many interferons.</p>

<p>In other people with severe COVID-19, the immune system turns against interferons themselves to cause severe disease, Casanova and his team found in the second study. Of 987 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, 135 people, or nearly 14 percent, had immune proteins in their blood that could attach to interferons.</p>



<p>In 101 severely ill patients, those immune proteins — called auto-antibodies because they recognize parts of the host rather than foreign invaders — could also stop interferon from activating other parts of the immune system. When researchers used plasma, the part of blood that contains antibodies, from eight patients with the auto-antibodies on lab-grown cells in dishes, the team found that the coronavirus could infect those cells even in the presence of interferon.</p>



<p>None of 663 people with mild or asymptomatic disease had those proteins. The team also tested blood samples taken from 1,227 people before the pandemic began and found that that only four people had auto-antibodies that recognized interferon.</p>



<p>In the severely ill patients, those auto-antibodies probably existed in their blood before they got sick, says Casanova, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the Rockefeller University in New York City. There are several known autoimmune conditions, for instance, where people generate auto-antibodies that attach to interferon, including one called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type I, or APS-1.</p>



<p>“The eureka moment came when we heard of three APS-1 patients with critical COVID-19, Casanova says. “That connected the dots and from there we tested [almost 1,000] patients.” Clinicians may be able to test for auto-antibodies to help determine who is at high risk for dangerous symptoms.</p>



<p>What’s more, the results may explain why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kills-more-men-than-women-why-immune-system">men are more likely than women</a> to become severely sick or die (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>). Of the 101 people who had the auto-antibodies, 94 percent were men. The immune proteins may also increase by age: More than half of the people with auto-antibodies were older than 65.   </p>



<p>The presence of auto-antibodies in some people may also present a problem for treatments like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-patient-convalescent-plasma-treatment">convalescent plasma</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/20</em>). People who have recovered from a serious bout of COVID-19 tend to have higher amounts of antibodies that recognize the coronavirus in their serum, which is ideal for treating patients with such plasma. But if auto-antibodies that block interferon are also present in the plasma, that might thwart the interferon-related immune response in patients that receive them. “That means a lot of caution is needed, and a lot more studies need to be done with convalescent plasma,” Barker says. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-lunar-lander-moon-radiation-health-risks-astronauts">A new moon radiation measurement may help determine health risks to astronauts</a></h4>

<p>A two-month stint on the moon would expose astronauts to roughly the same amount of radiation as they would get living on the International Space Station for five months, according to new measurements from the lunar surface.</p>



<p>Detectors on China’s lunar lander Chang’e-4 measured radiation from galactic cosmic rays at the moon’s surface in 2019, from January 3 to 12 — just after landing on the farside of the moon — and again from January 31 to February 10. An <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1334">astronaut would be exposed</a> to an average daily dose of 1,369 microsieverts of radiation, researchers report online September 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That’s about 2.6 times as high as the average daily radiation exposure of 523 microsieverts recorded inside the ISS, the scientists say. Being on the moon “for two months would be OK. That is about the same amount of radiation astronauts receive at the ISS [over five months] and wouldn’t be incredibly dangerous,” says coauthor Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber, a physicist at Christian Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany.</p>



<p>The new study is perhaps the first to measure cosmic radiation at the moon’s surface, says Jeffery Chancellor, a physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. “This is [a] pretty cool bit of data.” He cautions that radiation levels on other parts of the space station could be higher, so the authors may have overprojected the exposure difference between the moon’s surface and the ISS.</p>





<p>Galactic cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that zip through space, come from outside the solar system. Earth’s magnetic field protects humans from these rays, but in space, it’s a whole different story.</p>



<p>Long exposure to such radiation <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">can cause cellular and DNA damage</a> resulting in cancers, cataracts, cardiac problems, neurodegenerative diseases and behavioral impairments, animal studies have shown (<em>SN: 7/15/20</em>). So far, it’s unclear exactly what impact such exposure might have on human health. The effects of spending a large amount of time in space may show many years after someone has been exposed, says Marjan Boerma, a radiation biologist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock. </p>



<p>The findings come at a time when United States and other nations are making plans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-landed-moon-missions-apollo-top-science-stories-2019-yir">to land humans on moon</a> for the first time in decades (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-publishes-artemis-plan-to-land-first-woman-next-man-on-moon-in-2024/">NASA has announced</a> its plans to land the first U.S. woman and a man on the moon’s surface by 2024.</p>

<p>Tiny robots can operate as nerve cell connectors, bridging gaps between two distinct groups of cells. These microscopic patches may lead to more sophisticated ways to grow networks of nerve cells in the laboratory, and perhaps even illuminate ways <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb5696">to repair severed nerve cells in people</a>, researchers report September 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Engineers Eunhee Kim and Hongsoo Choi, both of the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, and colleagues first built rectangular robots that were 300 micrometers long. Slender horizontal grooves, about the width of nerve cells’ tendrils that exchange messages with other cells, lined the top.</p>



<p>These microrobots were fertile ground for rat nerve cells, the researchers found. As the cells grew, their message-sending axons and message-receiving dendrites neatly followed the robots’ lined grooves.</p>



<p>Once laden with about 100 nerve cells, a microrobot’s objective was to nestle between two separate islands of nerve cells, grown on glass plates, and bridge the gap. Rotating magnetic fields sent the microrobot tumbling pell-mell toward its target. When the microrobot drew close, researchers used a steadier magnetic field to align the bot between the two clusters of cells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a tiny robot connecting nerve cell clusters" class="wp-image-3091808" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092420_ls_brain-bots_inline_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091808">A microrobot carrying nerve cells (center bridge) connects two separate clusters of nerve cells (cell bodies are colored green in this micrograph, nuclei are blue), enabling those clusters to communicate.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091808">Eunhee Kim, Hongsoo Choi</span></figure>



<p>The nerve cells on the microrobot then grew out toward the clusters, while the cells in the clusters grew onto the bot. These new connections allowed neural signals to flow from one cluster of nerve cells to another, electrodes revealed.</p>



<p>Creating these neural bridges might help researchers design better replicas of complex nerve cell networks in the brain. Similar systems could also lead to new ways of studying nerve cell growth, experiments that could ultimately point to therapies for people with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mix-brain-training-physical-therapy-can-help-paralyzed-patients">nerve injuries</a> (<em>SN: 8/11/16</em>). Such precision building could also be useful in computing, allowing scientists to design and build biological computers with nerve cells.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/algae-light-phytoplankton-grow-dark-arctic-winter-ice">Trapped under ice, light-loving algae grow in the dark Arctic winter</a></h4>

<p>Each winter, Baffin Bay freezes over as polar darkness descends over the top of the world.</p>



<p>Come spring, phytoplankton will bloom in these cold waters between Greenland and Canada, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-winter-night-food-web-life-microbes-expedition-north-pole">bolstering a bustling ecosystem</a> of beluga whales and narwhals (<em>SN: 4/8/20</em>). But scientists have long assumed that the photosynthetic algae remain largely dormant in winter, blocked off from light by thick sea ice and snow.</p>



<p>New research challenges that assumption, however, finding that phytoplankton under the bay’s ice start growing as early as February, when the sun barely blips above the Arctic’s horizon.</p>



<p>Achim Randelhoff, an oceanographer at Université Laval in Quebec City, and colleagues deployed autonomous submersible floats in Baffin Bay that can measure photosynthetic activity and algae concentrations underwater.</p>







<p>In February, when light was barely detectable under about 1.5 meters of snow-covered ice, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eabc2678">Arctic phytoplankton begin growing and multiplying</a>, the researchers report September 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The study suggests that springtime blooms are the culmination of an extended period of growth that starts in winter, not a singular burst of activity as was thought.</p>



<p>“Arctic phytoplankton are superefficient at using every little photon they can find,” Randelhoff says, but he was surprised that they could grow with such little light. As the months progressed and the sun rose higher, the team found that algal growth accelerated, reaching its peak growth rate for the year in April and May, despite the microorganisms still being covered by ice.</p>



<p>How these photosynthetic algae can make do with such little light remains opaque. “So much of winter in the Arctic is still a black box,” Randelhoff says. “This is the kind of study that raises more questions than answers.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hope-life-venus-survives-centuries-against-all-odds">Hope for life on Venus survives for centuries against all odds</a></h4>

<p>If you’re looking for an exemplar of mastering multiple identities, find a telescope and point it at Venus.</p>



<p>In both astronomy and popular culture, Venus has always assumed a diversity of guises. Morning star, evening star. Goddess. Planet. Frankie Avalon song. A plant that eats flies. And the realm ruled by women in the unforgettable film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052104/"><em>Queen of Outer Space</em></a> (starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as the nemesis of the evil queen).</p>



<p>So it’s not surprising that Venus enjoys sufficient celebrity status to warrant big-type headlines when it makes news, or at least a lot of social media hype. In the latest such instance, all it took was a whiff of a noxious gaseous chemical in the planet’s clouds, hinting that Venus might harbor life, to stop the presses and start the tweetstorms. After all, life on Venus would be a big surprise. Scientists have long considered it the hell of the solar system, hotter than molten lead and with an unbreathable atmosphere.</p>



<p>Yet, as it was so ably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">reported by Lisa Grossman</a> for <em>Science News</em>, the chemical in question, phosphine, is no guarantee of life on Venus. It’s just that the known nonbiologic ways to make phosphine do not seem plausible in the Venusian environment. Phosphine’s persistence in the clouds shrouding Venus suggests something must be currently producing it — otherwise the sulfuric acid in the planet’s upper atmosphere would have destroyed any signs of the gas by now. So phosphine might be a signal of life — perhaps some form of anaerobic bacteria (which do not require oxygen), as phosphine would be deadly to life that relied on oxygen.</p>





<p>On the other hand, maybe there’s just a gap in Earthling chemistry textbooks, and some weird geochemical reactions produce Venusian phosphine. That’s probably a better bet than airborne anaerobic alien organisms. Phosphine as evidence of life on Venus may turn out to be as reliable as the famous “canals” once regarded as evidence for life on Mars.</p>



<p>Still, hope for life on Venus never dies. In centuries past, in fact, many scientists simply assumed that Venus possessed life. In the late 17th century, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, a French popularizer of science, surmised Venus to be inhabited by a gallant race of lovers. “The climate is most favorable for love matches,” he wrote. About the same time, the Dutch physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens contemplated life on Venus. Venusians would receive twice the light and heat from the sun as Earthlings do, he knew, but noted that Earth’s tropics, though much hotter than northern lands, are successfully occupied by people. For that matter, Huygens believed much hotter Mercury to be populated as well, and that the Mercurians would no doubt consider Earth much too cold and dark to support life.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, spectroscopic examination of Venus suggested that its atmosphere was similar to Earth’s, containing water vapor and oxygen. Since Earth’s atmospheric composition owed so much to life, it seemed obvious that life — at least plants— must exist on Venus as well. “If there be oxygen in the atmosphere of Venus, then it would seem possible that there might be life on that globe not essentially different in character from some forms of life on the earth,” astronomer Robert S. Ball wrote in his widely read late 19th century book <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"><em>The Story of the Heavens</em></a>. “If water be present on the surface of Venus and if oxygen be a constituent of its atmosphere, we might expect to find in that planet a luxuriant tropical life.”</p>



<p>As late as 1918, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1903/arrhenius/biographical/">Svante Arrhenius</a>, a Nobel chemistry laureate, estimated that water was especially abundant on Venus, with humidity six times the average on Earth. “We must therefore conclude that everything on Venus is dripping wet” — thereby accelerating the growth of vegetation, Arrhenius wrote.</p>



<p>But the early observations of Venus’ atmosphere were crude. About a century ago, refined techniques at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California contradicted the previous findings; oxygen and water vapor actually seemed scarce in the Venusian clouds. (In fact, as spacecraft visiting Venus in recent decades have shown, the air there is <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html">nearly all carbon dioxide with a little bit of nitrogen</a>, plus only slight traces of water.) “It may be that the exacting conditions for the origin of life have not been satisfied” on Venus, Charles E. St. John and Seth B. Nicholson wrote <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1922ApJ....56..380S">in 1922 in <em>the Astrophysical Journal</em></a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it was possible that conditions on the surface, hidden by the thick clouds, might still allow life to find a way. </p>



<p>“There is a possibility that the atmosphere of Venus is permeated with a finely divided dust, a possible product of intense volcanic activity, which would act as an excellent reflector of the sun’s rays and would at the same time effectually conceal the surface,” Isabel Lewis of the U.S. Naval Observatory wrote in <em>Science News-Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, in 1922. In 1926, the prominent astronomer Harlow Shapley maintained that in the solar system, Venus “more nearly fulfills the conditions [for life] than any planet other than the Earth…. But we cannot penetrate the dense covering of clouds and seek out the secrets of its surface.”</p>



<p>In 1927, <em>Science News-Letter</em> writer Frank Thone surveyed the prospects for life on other planets and declared Venus “the darling of the solar system” (excepting Earth, of course). While Mars seemed “wry and withered,” he wrote, “our sister Venus seems to have the vigor and sap of life in her.”</p>



<p>Yet as Thone acknowledged, the thick atmosphere guarding Venus’ surface from view made the question of life there unanswerable — probably, Thone guessed, for many generations.</p>



<p>And so today, the mystery remains unsolved. Phosphine sightings leave the question of whether Venus hosts life in a situation similar to that of Mars, long ago, when the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst (legend has it) cabled an astronomer asking for an article on the topic. “Is there life on Mars? Please cable one thousand words,” Hearst wrote. To which the astronomer cabled back: “Nobody knows. Repeat 500 times.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/interview-with-bruno-pichler/">Interview with Bruno Pichler</a></h4>

<p><em>Bruno Pichler studied medicine, obtained a PhD in neuroscience, worked in the labs of <a href="http://www.ifn.me.tum.de/new/konnerth.php">Arthur Konnerth</a>, <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab">Tom Mrsic-Flogel</a> and <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab">Troy Margrie</a>, and was R&amp;D manager at <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/">Scientifica</a>, before founding his own company, <a href="https://www.inss.org.uk/">INSS</a>, “to provide the international neuroscience community with bespoke hard- and software solutions and other consulting services”. He is not only a highly experienced builder and designer of two-photon microscopes but also a very friendly and open human being. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to ask him a couple of questions.</em></p>



<p><em>The interview took place on September 8</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em> 2020 in a virtual meeting and lasted around 1.5 hours. Afterwards, I transcribed, shortened and edited the recorded interview. For a brief orientation, here’s an ordered but non-exhaustive list of the topics discussed:</em></p>



<p><em>Why neuroscience?<br />How to get into optics and programming<br />Role models<br />Projects in academia<br />Why didn’t you become a PI?<br />At Scientifica<br />Founding one’s own company<br />Brexit<br />Performance checks for a 2P scope<br />Preamplifiers<br />How to clean optics<br />The detection path<br />Teaching people how to solve problems<br />Mesoscopes<br />mesoSPIM<br />AODs<br />Fixed-wavelength lasers<br />Multiplexed acquisition<br />Scanimage<br />Okinawa<br />Advice to young scientists<br />Bluegrass music<br /><br />If you find any questionable statements, you should consider blaming my editing first.</em></p>



<p><em>And since the entire interview is quite long, take a cup of tea, and take your time to read it</em>…</p>

<p><strong>Peter Rupprecht: </strong>You studied medicine before you started your PhD. What was your motivation to do a PhD in neuroscience, and to continue in neuroscience afterwards?</p>



<p><strong>Bruno Pichler:</strong> This was just something that happened: I really loved the first years of medical school, basic science, physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and all that. But halfway through medical school when the clinical work started, I realized that it wasn’t for me. So I looked for new inspiration, and I stumbled upon the website of Arthur Konnerth’s lab. I called on a whim and half an hour later I was in his office, and he offered me a job. He said, “why don’t you take a year off from medical school and start working towards a PhD here?” So I worked full-time in the lab for a year, and then went back to finish medical school. But at that point I had no interest in a career in clinical medicine, I just wanted to complete the medical degree and then work in the lab and continue my PhD. – So, not much thought behind it, it’s just how things transpired.</p>

<p><strong>PR:</strong> The medical studies did not really prepare you well for the more technical aspects of what you have been doing afterwards. How did you learn all of this, for example optics, or programming?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Again, it was just something that happened: there were microscopes that needed troubleshooting, there were things I didn’t understand, and every time I didn’t understand something, I tried to find more information about it. Some of the information sticks with you – and that’s how you learn and how you get into optics and software.<br />For example, there was some custom-written image analysis software in the lab and I didn’t really understand what it did to the data, so I sat down with the guy who wrote it and asked about all the calculations it made and then I cautiously started to make some changes to it – and it just naturally emerged from there. I never consciously sat down and said, “oh, I want to learn programming!” I had a problem in front of me that I needed to solve, and so I solved it. And whatever I learned while solving it is now part of my knowledge.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“People who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So would you describe yourself as a problem-solver?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think that is probably an accurate description. My main driving force is that whenever I see a technical problem, I want to find an elegant solution for it. I can’t help it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Did you have a role model as a scientist, or somebody who inspired you to continue with neuroscience?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I definitely have a few people who inspired me, but I wouldn’t say I had a ‘role model’. There’s obviously the intellectual giants like Richard Feynman or Horace Barlow. Then there are the scientists that I worked with, Arthur Konnerth, Tom Mrsic-Flogel, Troy Margrie, and of course all the colleagues in those labs. But, on a very practical level, people who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops. For example, Werner Zeitz, the electronics guy in Arthur Konnerth’s lab, who is known for his famous Zeitz puller (<a href="https://www.zeitz-puller.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.zeitz-puller.com/</a>). We were building a two-photon resonant scanner with Werner back in 2004/2005, and he built a 19” rack-mountable device box – no labels on it, just unlabeled pots and BNC connectors – which transformed the scanning data into a TV image and sent it to a frame grabber card. Nowadays, we do this in software but it was all done in hardware at the time. Same with the mechanical guy, Dietmar Beyer: He was such a skilled manual machinist, and he would just make whatever we needed without any CNC machining. Another guy that really inspired me back as a PhD student was Yury Kovalchuk. He was a senior postdoc at the time. He knew everything about two-photon microscopy, and he was building an AOD scanner back in 2004/2005. It was the way he understood these systems and explained everything to me whenever I had any questions – those kind of people inspired me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your entire academic career, what was your most rewarding project, big or small?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> That’s so difficult to say, because everything is kind of rewarding. What I can certainly say is that I don’t believe in putting off reward for a long time, and the idea that ‘the more you suffer, the bigger the reward’. I like it when you have smaller rewards, but more frequently.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I can definitely relate to this… but at least scientific publications usually do not come so frequently. If you have to choose, which scientific publication where you took part in would you like to highlight, and what was your contribution?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There was a paper in 2012 by Kamilla Angelo in Troy Margrie’s lab (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442227/">paper link</a>). I came very late to the party, all the experiments had already been done, the first version of the manuscript had been completed, and Troy just asked me to read it and give some comments. I noticed something in the analysis where the manuscript didn’t actually show unambiguously one aspect of the claim in the paper. We tried to come up with some way to design new experiments to prove that unambiguously, but at some point it occurred to me that you could just do it with the existing data, just with a different type of analysis. And once the idea had come up of doing this pair-wise scrambling of all the data points and then calculating pair-wise differences, it was very quick and easy to write some code to analyze it. And it supported exactly what we thought it would support, but now unambiguously. That felt really rewarding, to be able to nail something that would have otherwise required more experiments with a bit of clever analysis, that was really cool.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like that! Especially your PI was probably really happy about this, because it saved a lot of trouble.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I guess so. The paper would have been highly publishable without my input, but it was just ever so slightly better with my input; and that’s good enough for me.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Why did you not become a PI yourself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, to start with, I was never really PI material …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would you define as PI material?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Are you okay with an AC/DC reference? Would you understand what I mean when I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>No, not really …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Malcolm Young was the rhythm guitarist in AC/DC, he was always in the background and played this steady rhythm, whereas Angus Young is the flamboyant lead guitarist in his school uniform who runs up and down the stage and is the focal point of attention for the audience. When I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”, I’m talking about having a rock-solid line of people in the back who make sure that the lead guitarist and the lead singer can shine: I like to be in that role at the back. As a PI, you have to represent the lab, you have to present your work outside, you have to sell the ideas to funding bodies… so you have to have a little bit more of a flamboyant and outgoing nature. I’m too shy for this, so the PI path was never really on the cards for me to begin with. I was quite happy to be a sort of a medium level scientist – except that I felt there was more I could do to help other people. It felt self-indulgent to just play around with cool technology and have brainy conversations with smart people in the lab. I wanted to provide some value for others.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> And then you chose Scientifica. Why Scientifica? How did that happen?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I did not really choose Scientifica. I wasn’t actually looking for a job when I left academia. My plan was to go back to the Bavarian Alps and work as a skiing instructor –that’s what I had done before I went to medical school. I figured that it would be really nice to do that again for a season, to pass the time until some new opportunity floated past. And then it just so happened that the opportunity to work at Scientifica floated past earlier than I had anticipated. They rang me and said, “we’ve heard you’re leaving academia and we’re looking for a software person to do some custom stuff for Scientifica’s two-photon customers”, and I was like “well, that sounds like a good idea”, and then I joined Scientifica. There was no job interview, there was no searching for a job, the job found me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> How was the work like at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Initially it was mostly intended to be customization of software, for example little Matlab add-ons for Scanimage or stuff like that. But then we also needed a resonant scanning system, and there wasn’t really any software available for resonant scanning before Vidriotech started …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> … and then you wrote SciScan.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>And that’s when I wrote SciScan. I had already written a software for resonant scanning in Labview some years before – for the frame-grabber that we discussed earlier, so I already knew what to do. While writing SciScan I also became involved in the hardware development of the resonant scanner, with the mechanical engineer and the electrical engineer. And so the job role gradually moved towards R&amp;D management.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m a bit younger, so I don’t know whether the resonant scanners always came from Cambridge Technology, or was there a different provider? Or did you build the scanners in-house at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, the resonant scanners were always the same as back in 2003 when I first started using them. The manufacturer was originally called General Scanning Inc, then it became GSI Lumonics, which later merged with <a href="https://www.cambridgetechnology.com/">Cambridge Technology</a>, which was then bought by Novanta. There was a number of name changes involved, but no changes to the product.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Have you tried out resonant scanners from other companies as well?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m only aware of one other resonant scanner that is suitable for what we’re doing and that’s from a company called <a href="http://www.eopc.com/scanners.html">EOPC</a>. I have not actually worked with their resonant scanners yet, but I will be in probably about two weeks from now. We have bought two of their resonant scanners, because they can be synchronized with each other.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like a challenging project. Probably with two pulsed lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, it’s about temporal multiplexing with a single laser. We want the scanners to run in synchrony so that we can use a single data acquisition system for the two paths.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this makes sense. – After Scientifica, you founded your own company, INSS. What was the biggest challenge when you got started? And why did you found your own company?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The ‘why’ is very easy to explain: When I started with Scientifica, I was very close to the customers, I was building custom software modules, was interacting with scientists very closely when it came to making hardware modifications to any of the existing products or new suggestions for new hardware products. As the company grew bigger, I got more into a management role. I felt I was getting a little bit too far away from the customer and more involved in managing people and conducting things internally. It is a whole different style of working when you want to make something that is not a prototype but a production item where you want to sell 100 pieces of. Then you have to think more about questions like, how can we design it in a way that you can build it routinely and efficiently, and you have to think about all the supply chain, and build assembly instructions, and how you teach people to do that. There’s a lot of work in the background that is relatively far away from the actual experiment that the neuroscientist is going to do with that microscope and I felt like I wanted to get closer to that again. Also, if you want to sell hundreds of microscopes, it’s not really economically viable to do individual customer specials. From a business development perspective it’s perfectly understandable that Scientifica wanted to have a more standard offering and make off-the-shelf turn-key systems. But that was not so much what I was interested in. I like getting involved in changing things, not making the same thing all the time. I also felt that this sort of very customized, individualized service was not something that was available. When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true. If you’re a scientist you either buy a microscope that someone has designed to fit many purposes, but it may not be perfect for your very specific purpose. And I thought, well, surely there’s a need for modifying, customizing, making something perfect for a particular experiment and stripping out everything else that may not be needed. If you custom-build it from off-the-shelf components, you can save a lot of money. And surely from the money that people save they’d be quite happy to give me some of it, if I advise them how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Didn’t it feel like shaky ground when you started? I mean, you were responsible for everything, and you didn’t get a salary anymore.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I think what helped a lot is that I’ve been involved in the music scene, and I knew a lot of musicians that were self-employed. They were getting money from gigs and teaching and playing on other people’s records and they were making a living without being employed – and I felt I could do the same thing. I had been playing gigs, I knew how to ask a pub owner to pay us money for providing music in the pub. And I figured, conceptually it wouldn’t be much different whether I come to your lab and build something for you, or whether I come to your pub and play a gig for you. You just ask beforehand how much you’re going to get paid for the gig, and if it isn’t enough to cover the costs then you can’t play that gig – it’s not exactly rocket science. It was good that I’d done it for a few years in the music business, it gave me a lot more confidence that this would work out in the microscope consulting business, too.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>INSS is based in the UK. Have you been affected by the Brexit so far, or will you be affected by it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I haven’t been affected by Brexit yet, everything is still the same until the end of 2020. Nobody knows what sort of forms we will need to fill in next year, and what sort of new hoops we might need to jump through. I’m not going to start worrying about that now because I don’t know what it’s going to be. – Don’t get me wrong: Brexit will be disastrous on so many levels, especially now, piling onto the coronavirus crisis. And of course it’s also a little bit disappointing… I’ve lived in this country for 13 years and I feel like I made a nice contribution, doing science, paying taxes, playing music. And then all these people feel that someone like me shouldn’t be here because we’re a burden on the country and they’d rather pull up the drawbridge; and they think it’s worth taking all these economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit just to keep people like me out of their country. But if that’s what the majority voted for, then I just have to deal with this somehow. I’m reasonably optimistic that I’ll find some way to navigate these new circumstances!</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I get the impression that you are quite optimistic in general. Do you think this is a requirement for being self-employed?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think it’s probably a requirement if you don’t want to live a life in misery. You have to be somewhat optimistic or at least relaxed about what the future might hold because the future is kind of uncertain. You’re not going to know what’s going to happen. If you worry about it, it will not change the fact that the future is uncertain. So you might as well say “I’ll jump down that bridge when I get there”.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> If you don’t mind, let’s talk about some technical questions … after you set up a two-photon microscope in somebody’s lab, how do you quickly check its performance? Do you have a specific routine?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The quickest performance check is to image a pollen grain slide. You check how the spiky pollen grains look like, whether you can section them nicely and how the field of view [FOV] is like. Once you’ve done it a few times, it is everything you need to get a quick qualitative idea of whether everything is working fine. If you want to do it more quantitatively then you obviously want to image beads, you want to check your field flatness, you want to get your precise FOV measurements with some grids, and so on. We have a routine that we’re working with that we constantly improve, but in the majority of cases that’s not even necessary.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I think there are some companies which sell special calibration slides or samples. When would this be useful, or do you think it is overkill?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I would love to use those, but they are not really suitable for 2P. You are talking about the Argolight probes?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Yes…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> So, they specifically mention that you shouldn’t be using them with 2P, or you use them at your own risk. Also, they cost about 8’000 euros. I don’t really want to spend 8’000 euros on something where I can quickly exceed the damage threshold, and that’s why I haven’t used them. I would love to have something like that if it’s available for two photon. In the meantime, I’ll stick with these electron microscopy grids and beads and pollen grains. – What are your thoughts on those, have you tried anything like that?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Several years ago I also wanted to check the field curvature for a two-photon microscope and borrowed a quite expensive calibration slide from the confocal microscopy facility, but I managed to destroy it, and that’s when I stopped experimenting. Usually, I just use beads and fluorescent plastic slides. Not so much pollen grains, because I have destroyed the slides several times.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong><em>(curious) </em>How do you destroy a pollen grain slide?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just by leaving the slide somewhere in the setup, until something makes the glass break; which happened to me twice so far. I also made some simple pollen samples in agar, but that’s not possible in winter or autumn. So I’m usually sticking to beads. But in principle I agree, pollen slides are ideal, you quickly find the samples and you can also check how the fluorescence yield changes across the FOV. Do you make your own pollen grain slides?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’re using pollen slides from Carolina Biological Supply Company. They make these ready-made pollen grain slides for schools and educational settings and the slide is like five dollars or something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I didn’t know they were so cheap! The first scanning confocal microscope that I used [a Leica SP5] had come with a pollen slide, and I had been instructed to treat the slide very carefully, because it was so expensive… So it’s good to know that it can be really cheap! – Just another question about two-photon microscopes: which preamplifier would you recommend for a standard resonant scanning two-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We often use the Thorlabs preamps, the TIA60, and we also use the Thorlabs PMTs with the built-in preamps, which is quite convenient. You control them through USB, and you can set the amplifier bandwidth in software.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I thought the bandwidth was fixed at 60 MHz?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, for the TIA60 preamps, it’s fixed at 60 MHz. For the PMTs with the built-in preamplifiers, you can choose between, I think, 80 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 200 kHz. When we need higher bandwidth for something, then we would use Femto preamps.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Which one is your preferred preamp from Femto?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I use the 400 MHz one.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Let’s talk about objectives… If you were postdoc in a lab and could choose any objective for testing, which one would you choose?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I had a Nikon 25x NA1.1 when I was in Troy’s lab, and that’s a really nice objective. For the typical applications I was working at – population calcium imaging – that’s just a beautiful objective. I wouldn’t really need to try anything else. I’m sure there are other applications that would benefit from some of these newer Olympus long working distance objectives, but it’s so application specific, and there’s good uses for all of them. So, without having a particular experiment in mind, it would be difficult to answer the question.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For these Olympus objectives, I think the working distance is something like 4 or 8 mm. Does the 8 mm make any sense for neuroscience applications?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again, it depends on your application, right? These objectives were primarily designed for cleared brains, where you don’t have much of a choice, you either use a long working distance or you’re not imaging all of it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Ok, I didn’t know that it was for designed for cleared brains. Now, this makes much more sense to me. – Speaking about objectives, how do you usually clean optical elements? Do you use tap water or distilled water, or can you recommend any other protocols?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers. You just try to blow everything off that might be there. If that doesn’t work with the blower, you get out the compressed air can. From there, we’ll go to distilled water, and then Purosol. If I can’t get it off with that, I would go to isopropyl alcohol, and then to methanol. But we’re usually dealing with new microscopes, so in the vast majority of cases, we don’t have to go past the compressed air can.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What do you do with dichroics if they’re dirty or if there’s sticky dust on top of them? Is there anything you can do?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I wouldn’t really want to go far beyond the distilled water on a dichroic. If I can’t get it off with that, I might try the Purosol, but we don’t encounter dirty dichroics very often, because most of the optics we’re working with are brand new.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Another question about 2P microscopes: I was always wondering about a proper way to test the alignment and performance of collection optics. How do you check whether collection optics are properly aligned?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I want to capture all the light that’s coming out of the back aperture of the objective. So, if you just put some light source and a diffuser under the objective – that can be the LED on a phone with a bit of lens tissue on top as a diffuser –, you’ll get a large cone of light coming out the back aperture. Then you screw in a little target at the position where your PMT will be sitting. You should see a spot right in the center that has the size of the PMT sensor.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just to repeat, it’s important to remove the PMT in this case, right?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, you need to remove the PMT and put a target in its place. If you want to do it more quantitatively, it gets difficult. You could use a calibrated light source and count how many photons you get through and compare that over many microscopes and so on. But I don’t think anyone is doing that in practice.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Let’s assume a customer writes to you that there’s a problem with their two-photon system, “because the signal becomes weaker”. This is something I also often hear from less experienced colleagues or friends who ask for some help with their setup. What would be your first guess if you don’t know anything else?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> In the first instance I would think of it as a great opportunity to help someone to think systematically about the problem. Because if all they tell me is that “the signal becomes weaker”, then they haven’t really thought about how to communicate a problem in such a way that the other person can do something with it. I would need to know so much more , for example: what’s the signal? what’s the system? what are you measuring? have you done the same experiment over a year, and every day it gets a little bit weaker?, or is that happening within the same animal, or within the same slice? … there’s a thousand different questions. I need to find out what the person means by “signal”, what the person means by “becomes”, what they mean by “weaker”. It’ll be beneficial for that person, and for me, if I can teach them how to clarify their thoughts to themselves, and then communicate them efficiently. Maybe next time they know immediately why it’s becoming weaker simply because they’ve changed the way they think.<br />I have to say that I enjoy it very much to help someone to clarify to themselves what the problem is. It’s very rewarding for the person to figure out the problem by themselves, and it’s rewarding for me to teach someone a problem-solving skill that they might not have had before.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I think you have also participated in some summer schools?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>That’s right, I’ve been at the <a href="https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-IMAG&amp;year=19">Cold Spring Harbor imaging course</a> five times – which is great fun, a great location and great teachers. I’m also participating every year at <a href="https://www.tenss.ro/">TENSS</a> in Romania, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School, again a great team of people that are running it with great lecturers and great spirit among students and all the TAs and lecturers. I really enjoy teaching people and helping them to figure things out. I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves. I might nudge them in the right direction, but if I simply told them what to do, I feel I’d be depriving them of a joyful moment of revelation.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>It can also be a bit dangerous to align laser beams, and especially invisible IR beams. To make the laser beam visible, do you use IR viewers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I use them occasionally, but only when I have to, so only when I’m working with a fixed-wavelength laser. And even then I try to do as much as I can with viewing cards rather than the viewer itself. Although I tend to go back and forth a little bit between card and viewer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For the tunable lasers, do you switch to visible wavelengths or what do you think about the pointing stability of those lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I usually align everything in the visible range and then, once we switch to IR, I image a uniform slide and check if our alignment is nice and centered. The illumination on the slide tells you whether you’ve gone off a little bit.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> To clarify, I was thinking more about pointing stability when changing the wavelength of the tunable laser for example from 700 nm to 900 nm…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think the changes are drastic. But we’re doing the final alignment through the actual scan head based on what we’re seeing on the computer screen from the fluorescent slide, and we’re doing that at 900 or 930 nm anyway. In that sense, the visible beam is only a first approximation.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> But this also means that you have to be quite tall, because otherwise you cannot reach the adjustment screws of the mirrors and at the same time look at the screen to check the fluorescence of the slide…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, you need some access to those screws and a clear visual path to the computer monitor. You can walk around the table and do it from the back, as long as you can see the computer screen, right?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Yes… probably I was just thinking about some situations in the past where I tried to do this myself and needed to stretch quite far to reach the adjustment screw and at the same time look around the corner to see the screen …</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Have you tried moving the screen?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Not really … okay, I think you’ve identified the problem, it’s just laziness from my side! – But one more question about objectives: what do you think about two-photon mesoscopes with FOVs of several millimeters? Are they more difficult to build or maintain? Do you think they will become more standard or is it just a trend?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It completely depends on the application. If there are experiments that you can’t do with a standard FOV microscope, you need a wide FOV microscope. If you want to image two areas simultaneously with cellular resolution that are too far apart for a normal FOV, you don’t really have that much of a choice. A microscope like that is certainly more difficult to build, because you need custom optics for it, which are really expensive, and that is something that will prevent them from becoming really standard in every lab very soon. A lot of experiments don’t require such large FOV microscopes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you don’t think that these objectives or lenses will become much cheaper in the future and allow them to become more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think they’ll go down in price very much. And they’re also difficult to maintain, and you need custom pre-chirpers. You basically need a dedicated imaging engineer in the lab who’s maintaining those microscopes, and even if you buy it commercially, for example the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646">2P RAM mesoscope</a> from Thorlabs, you need someone who’s working with that microscope every day to monitor its performance and fine tune it and so on and so forth. I hope that we’ll see a few more mesoscopes popping up in the future, because there are very interesting questions that you can answer with them, and maybe the prices will come down a little bit. But I don’t think they’ll come down far enough for it to be a standard thing that everyone has.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Do you also have any experience with setting up confocal microscopes or light-sheet microscopes and, if yes, how is this different from setting up two-photon microscopes?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I have not set up a confocal microscope so far, but I have set up a mesoSPIM light sheet microscope that your colleague Fabian [Voigt] in Fritjof [Helmchen]’s lab has designed. It was a very different experience in the sense that this was probably the first time that we’ve built something where we had basically no input in the design, and we were following someone else’s instructions. That was a little bit daunting, simply because I’d never done it before, but Fabian’s documentation is just so excellent that it turned out to be not a problem at all, and in that sense it was not much different to what we usually do when building a two-photon.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you also have any plans of building a three-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m going to build whatever people ask me to build. We’ve done a lot of 2p microscopes, but we’ve also built wide-field microscopes, we’ve built a mesoSPIM, we’re working on a microscope for in-situ sequencing, I’ve helped people with LabView coding. Whatever it is that people ask me, if I have time to do it and it sounds interesting, I’ll do it. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So, even if I gave you a lot of money to make you build a 3D AOD-based two-photon scanning microscope, would you give it a try? I’ve heard that it is extremely challenging to make this run stably.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would certainly try it – and get the right people involved. I was actually a co-author on an AOD paper some ten years ago with people from Angus Silver’s lab. AOD systems are a little bit finicky, but with the right person, with the right project, with the right collaborators on board, I don’t see why someone who wants an AOD system shouldn’t attempt to build one. I’m sure that some of these teething problems that any new technology always has will be ironed out over the next few years</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you’re quite optimistic about the future role of AOD scopes for two-photon microscopy?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>For the right applications – yes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>As we mentioned you also provide your service in order to help your customers save costs. If a lab really wants to save money, would you recommend to buy a fixed-wavelength laser for two-photon microscopy? I’m also not sure whether there are already some 920 nanometer lasers around …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There are now a few manufacturers that build fixed wavelength 920 nanometer lasers, and if someone says, all I’m going to do with this microscope for the next three or four years is GCaMP imaging and I just want to have a workhorse for that, then that’s certainly a good option. If it’s a young lab that only has a single two-photon microscope in the lab, and they don’t know exactly what sort of projects might come along next year and what sort of dyes they might be using next year, then it’s a bit of a risk to bet all your money on a single wavelength. This is probably more something for labs that have another two-photon with a tunable laser, where they can do experiments in the red or where they can explore other dyes that aren’t excitable at 920 nm.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have examples for companies which sell fixed wavelength lasers at 920 nm?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Coherent are selling one now, the <a href="https://www.coherent.com/lasers/laser/axon">Axon 920</a>; Spark Lasers have <a href="https://spark-lasers.com/compact-femtosecond-laser-biophotonics-alcor/">a few options</a> for 920 nm; there’s Menlo, a company in Munich that sells the <a href="https://www.menlosystems.com/products/femtosecond-lasers-and-amplifiers/ylmo930/">Ylmo-930</a>; Toptica have a <a href="https://www.toptica.com/products/psfs-fiber-lasers/femtofiber-ultra/femtofiber-ultra-920/">920 model</a>, also <a href="https://www.nktphotonics.com/lasers-fibers/product-category/koheras-single-frequency-lasers/">NKT Photonics</a> – there’s quite a few around now. I haven’t actually tried any of them yet, but it’s certainly going in a direction where we’ll be seeing these more often in the field.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Another technical question – you mentioned it already: what’s your opinion on multiplexed acquisition? Will it remain a niche product like the mesoscopes, or do you think it will become much more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again it depends completely on your application … if you want to image two areas simultaneously without having to jump between them – whether that’s on a mesoscope where you image two different brain areas that are millimeters apart, or whether you want to image a single neuron and you want to image soma and spines both with very zoomed-in resolutions, but without having to jump between them – then multiplexed acquisition can be the right technique. If you don’t have the right question for multiplexed acquisition, then there’s no point getting it. All of these things are only useful in a very particular context that depends on the scientific question that you want to answer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I always thought that multiplexed acquisition might be particularly difficult to implement because it’s not only challenging in terms of hardware and optical alignment, but also the software to disentangle the two multiplexed photon streams is not trivial. I was thinking that this combination of both hardware and software challenges might be a bottleneck which prevents many people from doing it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well… you can also de-multiplex the channels in hardware using an analog system. Spencer Smith and Jeffrey Stirman used a nice system in their 2016 Nature Biotechnology paper with a wide FOV (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27347754/">paper link</a>), where they actually had an analog photon-counting system and then just acquired with a standard data acquisition system. They didn’t need to change anything in software because all the photon counting was done in the analog domain. But now, with these gigahertz data acquisition systems, you can acquire the data fast enough, get the laser timing and then assign different acquisition time bins to different channels. Scanimage can do that now, so it’s not really a challenge any more.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have an opinion about the new <a href="https://vidriotechnologies.com/vdaq/">vDAQ</a> system of Scanimage? I think it’s not based on National Instruments hardware any more.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’ve built a couple of microscopes with those systems, and they seem very nice, very user-friendly. There’s no obvious downside, although I haven’t had a chance to really observe them over the same time periods as I have with National Instruments for over 20 years. But I have very high hopes for these systems, and we’re using them as standard now. The only situation where we’re not using them at the moment is when we have to count photons, because the data acquisition speed is currently 125 MHz max on the vDAQ. But there will be a new vDAQ version coming out later this year, with high-speed acquisition that will then be suitable for photon counting.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I see. Maybe, to finish up, some fun questions… or maybe not so much fun, let’s see. During your time at INSS, what was your most challenging project?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>One of the first microscopes we built was in Okinawa, Japan. Shipping all the microscope parts to Okinawa was a bit of a challenge. Three of the four boxes arrived without problem, but the box with my toolkit didn’t arrive and was completely lost for about a week or so. UPS didn’t know where it was. They had scanned it in Tokyo, but then lost track of it and had absolutely no idea where it was. I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too. I had lots of spare parts in the toolkit, and all sorts of specialist tools that were difficult to replace in the shortness of time. That was a challenge to my otherwise unshakable optimism … In the end, the toolkit did arrive and everything was fine; I built the microscope, no problem with that. But then I needed to ship the toolkit back, and UPS kept cancelling the booking and no one on the customer service hotline knew why. We eventually shipped it back with Fedex. It was all very annoying, and I then decided to get a shipping agent who’s now managing all of our shipping for us, and he’s been brilliant.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this sounds like a rough start…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Yes … having these useful conversations with UPS customer service … It makes my blood boil just thinking about it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What was the most expensive device you destroyed by accident?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I don’t really know, I don’t remember.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> You never destroyed an objective?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I never destroyed an objective, never destroyed a laser; I’ve destroyed scan mirrors, ETLs, stuff like that, probably a few other items in that price range. But I move on from that pretty quickly. I always think of it as a tuition fee that I have to pay, and then I forget about the incident. But the knowledge of what not to do stays with me.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Which skill do you wish you have learned earlier that would be of use for your current job?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Hm, all of them! I would love to have university degrees in electronic engineering and optical physics and project management, computer science, business administration, and applied math. Almost every technical thing or business thing that you could learn at a university would be in some way useful to my current job. But I also have to be realistic about how much I can do with the available time. These disciplines have crossed my path sort of superficially, and I’ve picked up what I can. I wish I had a really solid foundation in all of them, but I have to live with my limitations.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>This sounds quite modest, given your expertise in so many domains… if you had to pick one, what would you learn if you had one year for that?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Probably math. I’d really like to go back to undergraduate level math and learn all the foundations properly.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your long experience in research and as a consultant, what kind of advice would you give to students or postdocs who want to learn the skills which are needed to understand a microscope or, more generally, to set up experiments?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> You just have to start, just go and do it. If you want to set up a microscope, go online, google “how to set up a microscope”, and then click your way to the websites where you can find how to set up a microscope. Maybe someone recommends to go to a course, maybe someone recommends a particular Youtube video. You’ll find all the resources that you need. This is such a great time to be alive, because you can find everything that you need online. You can apply for courses like the CSHL course that we discussed about, or TENSS, or numerous other imaging courses. If you don’t get into any of those courses, you can still learn it all online and just start building. A lot of people now offer very simple 3D-printed parts to set up basic optics and teach yourself the skills. You don’t even have to wait until you’re a student or a postdoc, you can do that as a little school project when you’re 12 years old, because all the learning resources are online.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you would encourage self-learning, because that’s the way to learn what you have learned yourself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It’s one way that works for me. Other people have different working styles, and your own working style emerges when you start doing something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would be your advice for young scientists like PhD candidates or postdocs who think about a career like yours?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat; if you work more like an artist or an artisan and just focus on improving whatever your chosen art or your chosen craft is, then you’re going to get good at it, and then you’ll enjoy doing it. And if you keep an open mind, intriguing opportunities will pop up. And if you pursue these opportunities whenever they present themselves, then you’ll end up with the very tortuous career trajectory that I have, that doesn’t seem to make any obvious sense from outside. But for me, internally, it had a very natural flow. You’re obviously also going to need a massive amount of good luck; but I don’t really have any advice on how to get lucky.</p>



<p>On a side note, for anyone who’s considering starting their own business or doing something on their own, there’s an old blog post written by a banjo player called Danny Barnes. He writes about how to make a living by playing music (<a href="https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music">https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music</a>), and while the blog post is ostensibly about music, there’s a lot of advice that applies to any self-employed person, not just musicians; and also not just to self-employed people, it applies to anyone who is in some way in a largely self-directed job – which I guess is the case for most scientists. There are a few paragraphs in there that are more specific to music, but I think it’s just a very good read on how you want to conduct business and life with other people and make a living from it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m curious, and I’ll check it out! … I think it has become obvious by now that you’re a big music aficionado. On Twitter, you describe yourself, among others, as ‘Bluegrass Dobroist’. Could you explain this to somebody without any clue, like myself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>A Dobro is an American instrument, it’s like an acoustic guitar that has an aluminium resonator cone built into the body. Originally, it was invented to make a normal guitar louder, a bit like a speaker cone that picks up the vibrations from the strings and projects them outward. The Dobro was invented in the 1920s to make the guitar <em>a little bit</em> louder to be heard over orchestras, and it was kind of popular for a few years, until someone invented an electric guitar that you could just very easily make <em>a lot</em> louder, and then the Dobro fell into obscurity. It’s played in a lap style, and you’re not fretting the strings with your fingers like on a normal guitar, but you use a steel bar that slides up and down the strings.</p>



<p><em>(Since I did not fully understand the following explanations, he pulls out a Dobro and simply shows to me via video how it works to play a Dobro.)</em></p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>And what is the meaning of ‘bluegrass’?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Bluegrass originally comes from the American state of Kentucky. Kentucky has a certain type of grass that has a sort of a blue appearance, and that’s why Kentucky is called the bluegrass state. There was a band in the 1940s that came from Kentucky; the band leader was called Bill Monroe and this band was called the Bluegrass Boys. Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys played a very new and unique style of acoustic country music, and then other people started copying that style, and eventually because of the name of the band the style became known as Bluegrass music, and that evolved into a whole genre of music. Now, there’s tons of bluegrass bands, and bluegrass music, bluegrass festivals, and there’s a Grammy for bluegrass music. So, from this one band in the 1940s a very huge branch of music has emerged.</p>

<p><strong>PR: </strong>Interesting, I didn’t know that.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’ll be most happy to talk a lot more about bluegrass music all day long! I love it – I’ve been really involved in this scene for the last 12 years or so, going to festivals almost every weekend – obviously not now with the pandemic, and generally a little less since I started the company and since we had a baby two years ago. I’ve got a lot of other things to do now, but I’m still very much connected to the whole music scene and to the guys in the band and all that. Sometimes during the time when I worked at Scientifica, I was playing five, six, seven gigs a month even though I was living here in East Sussex and drove an hour and a half or two hours into London after work to play gigs and come back during the night to be back at Scientifica in the morning…</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>At the end, is there anything else you want to share?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I want to give a quick shout-out to my team, Angelos, Eleanor, Mark and Simon, who are just a massive pleasure to work with.<br />Other than that, if people want any sort of clarification on the things that I’ve mentioned, if people are thinking about transitioning from academia to industry and there are questions popping up, send me an email or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be quite happy to answer questions and give advice!</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you. I think you gave already a lot of good advice here!</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m glad to hear that.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>The arXiv development team is pleased to announce a major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which is based on the official <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> update. <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/tex">TeX</a> is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.</p>
<p>This update, set to release on October 1, 2020, provides enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team also used this opportunity to address bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.</p>
<p>Authors should be aware that works submitted between now and September 30, 2020 must adhere to current arXiv TeX guidelines (<a href="https://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/faq/#tex">here</a>). Works prepared in accordance with <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> are welcome starting after 8am EDT on October 1, 2020.</p>
<p>arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex">TeX has many advantages</a> that make it ideal for the archives: it is plain text, compact, and freely available for all platforms, and it also produces high-quality output.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-brazil-city-manaus-herd-immunity">A Brazilian city devastated by COVID-19 may have reached herd immunity</a></h4>

<p>The Brazilian city of Manaus was hit hard by COVID-19. At the peak of its epidemic in late spring, the city of over 2 million people had 4.5 times as many deaths as expected for that time of year. Hospitals and cemeteries struggled to keep up, and mass graves were dug to bury the dead. But then, cases and deaths steadily declined, despite a relaxing of social distancing measures. </p>



<p>That trajectory has prompted some researchers to suggest that Manaus has reached herd immunity. In a report posted September 21 at medRxiv.org that has yet to be peer reviewed, researchers propose that herd immunity developed in the city after <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787v1">44 to 52 percent of the population was infected</a> at the epidemic’s peak, and that slowed subsequent spread of the virus.</p>



<p>“These are the highest [infection] levels I’ve seen,” says Elitza Theel, a clinical microbiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wasn’t involved in the study. That high infection rate may very well have impacted the trajectory of the epidemic. “That is how herd immunity works,” she says. “But it comes at a high cost … their death rate was very high.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">Herd immunity</a> occurs when enough people become immune to an infectious disease, either through infection or a vaccine, causing an epidemic to slow down as the pathogen is starved of susceptible hosts (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>). Scientists are still working out what the herd immunity threshold would be for COVID-19; most estimates are around 40 to 60 percent of a population.</p>

<p>The precise threshold likely varies from region to region, but virtually all of the globe remains well below this threshold, experts say. Most of the United States remains in the single digits, though around 20 percent of the population in parts of New York City may have already contracted the virus.</p>



<p>To investigate whether herd immunity developed in Manaus, researchers from Brazil and the United Kingdom turned to blood donations, looking for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Blood donations aren’t a random sample of the population. They tend to come from healthy, asymptomatic adults, and so could miss infections in older people who may be more vulnerable to infection, as well as in kids. Still, the donations offer a way to measure seroprevalence, the proportion of a population that’s been exposed to a virus and has developed antibodies against it.</p>



<p>Researchers tested about 800 to 1,000 blood donations each month from February to August, and attempted to control for potential confounding factors, such as the sensitivity of different tests and the fact that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">antibodies can wane over time</a> (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>). They also tested blood donations from São Paolo, another Brazilian city. “This is one of the best papers that I’ve seen that really does try to account waning antibody levels over time” and other factors, Theel says.</p>



<p>In Manaus, the prevalence of antibodies to the coronavirus in blood donors hovered below 1 percent early on in the pandemic, the team found. In April, it rose to 4.8 percent and then rocketed to 44.2 percent in May and reached a peak of 51.8 percent in June, a trajectory that roughly followed the curve of accumulating deaths.</p>

</aside>



<p>After that peak, seroprevalence fell, reaching 30 percent in August, a consequence of both waning antibody levels in people already infected and lower transmission rates, the researchers say.</p>



<p>While social distancing measures probably helped slow the spread of the virus, the team argues that high population immunity played a bigger role in curbing the epidemic. As of August, the researchers estimate 66 percent of the population had been infected. Whether the city will avoid another outbreak remains to be seen, and will depend in part on how long protective immunity lasts.</p>



<p>The researchers warn that their findings can’t be directly translated to other cites because of differences in factors such as demographics, behavior and adherence to social distancing measures.</p>



<p>Why Manaus may reached herd immunity when other cities haven’t remains unclear. São Paolo for instance, a bustling city of over 12 million, never topped 14 percent seroprevalence despite both cities implementing similar social distancing measures, the analyzed blood donations show. The study authors point to Manaus’ lower socioeconomic conditions, more crowded housing and reliance on boat travel, as factors that could have accelerated the spread of the virus there.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate close to 4,000 people died from COVID-19 in Manaus, a high death toll for a city where only <a href="https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/am/manaus/pesquisa/23/25888?detalhes=true">6 percent of the population is over 60</a>. The city had an infection fatality rate between 0.17 and 0.28 percent, the study suggests. The costs of reaching herd immunity via infection in other cities, especially where there are more older people could be much, much higher. Estimates of São Paolo’s infection fatality rate range as high as 0.72 percent.</p>



<p>Overall, Manaus’ experience reveals “that an unmitigated outbreak will lead to very significant morbidity and mortality,” says Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, “which is basically what we’ve been saying since February.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Imagine that you are a high-achieving student at a school which, overall, doesn’t perform that well. You know that your grades are better than most of your peers’, so you probably rate your academic ability quite high. You are, in other words, a big fish in a small pond. </p>



<p>Now you transfer to a school in which the other students consistently get top marks, perhaps even better than yours. You’re now the small fish in a big pond, and although your own ability has remained the same, you begin to doubt yourself and actually rate yourself lower than you had before.</p>



<p>This “big-fish-little-pond” effect shows that our academic self-concept can be profoundly shaped by how we compare ourselves to our peers. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620956535">study in<em> Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a> has found that the size of this comparison matters: the effect is even more pronounced when people are <em>extremely</em> high achieving in very low ranked groups, or vice-versa.</p>


<p><span id="more-40380"></span></p>


<p>It might seem obvious that when people make more extreme comparisons with their peers, their self-evaluations should receive more of a boost (or take more of a hit, depending on the direction of that comparison). But as Ethan Zell and Tara Lesick from the University of North Carolina note in their new paper, no-one had actually looked into this.</p>



<p>In the first study, the pair asked 187 people to complete a verbal reasoning test which involved completing sentences. Participants were then told that the same task had been completed by other students from their own university, as well as students from 39 other universities.</p>



<p>Participants received different information about how they had done relative to their peers at their university, and how well their university scored compared to the other institutions. There were four conditions: <em>big-fish-little-pond</em> (participants did better than 65% of peers; university ranked better than 35% of other institutions);<em> little-fish-big-pond</em> (participants did better than 35% of their peers; university ranked better than 65% of others); <em>huge-fish-tiny-pond</em> (participants did better than 85% of peers; university ranked above just 15% of others); and <em>tiny-fish-huge-pond</em> (participants did better than only 15% of peers; university outranked 85% of others).</p>



<p>Participants then rated their own verbal ability and performance on the test. As expected, big fish in little ponds — i.e. those who read that they were somewhat above average in a somewhat below average group — gave themselves better self-evaluations than little fish in big ponds. But this effect was accentuated for the other two conditions: huge fish in tiny ponds — i.e. those who read that they were <em>far</em> above average in a <em>far</em> below average group — rated themselves as even better than big fish. Tiny fish in huge ponds rated themselves as even worse than little fish.</p>



<p>In a subsequent study, the team looked at what happened to this effect when people also received information about their overall level of performance. This is important because in a group that is far above average, someone who scores well below average <em>for that group</em> could still have a pretty good objective performance. </p>



<p>In this study, some participants in the huge-fish-tiny-pond condition were told they had done better than 35% of all American test-takers, while some in the tiny-fish-huge-pond condition were told they had done better than 65% of Americans.  This meant that participants in the huge-fish-tiny-pond group were 30 percentile points lower than those in the tiny-fish-huge-pond group. And yet, the effect still occurred (albeit at a smaller scale): they rated their abilities as higher than those in the latter group.</p>



<p>Finally, the researchers found evidence that this effect is driven by people focussing on their own rank within a group, rather than on how their group compares to others. Participants ranked extremely highly in their group rated their abilities as high no matter whether the group was itself of high or low rank. Similarly, those who ranked low in their group rated their ability as low, regardless of their group’s rank.</p>



<p>Overall the work shows that even if you are a member of an elite group, it can be demoralising to learn that you are a “tiny fish” who is performing worse than your peers, the authors write. Further work is needed to see whether this effect extends to real-world situations, and explore what its repercussions are for people’s career and study choices.</p>

<p>At Bumpass Hell in California’s Lassen Volcanic National Park, the ground is literally boiling, and the aroma of rotten eggs fills the air. Gas bubbles rise through puddles of mud, producing goopy popping sounds. Jets of scorching-hot steam blast from vents in the earth. The fearsome site was named for the cowboy Kendall Bumpass, who in 1865 got too close and stepped through the thin crust. Boiling, acidic water burned his leg so badly that it had to be amputated.</p>



<p>Some scientists contend that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2019.2045">life on our planet arose in such seemingly inhospitable conditions</a>. Long before creatures roamed the Earth, hot springs like Bumpass Hell may have promoted chemical reactions that linked together simple molecules in a first step toward complexity. Other scientists, however, place the starting point for Earth’s life underwater, at the deep hydrothermal vents where heated, mineral-rich water billows from cracks in the ocean floor.</p>



<p>As researchers study and debate where and how life on Earth first ignited, their findings offer an important bonus. Understanding the origins of life on this planet could offer hints about where to search for life elsewhere, says Natalie Batalha, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It has very significant implications for the future of space exploration.” Chemist Wenonah Vercoutere agrees. “The rules of physics are the same throughout the whole universe,” says Vercoutere, of NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. “So what is there to say that the rules of biology do not also carry through and are in place and active in the whole universe?”</p>

<h4>Lure of the land</h4>



<p>At its biochemical core, the recipe for life relies on only a few ingredients: chemical elements, water or other media where chemical reactions can occur and an energy source to power those reactions. On Earth, all of those ingredients exist at terrestrial hot springs, home to some hardy creatures. Great Boiling Spring in Nevada, for example, is a scalding 77° Celsius, yet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10476">microbes manage to eke out an existence in water</a> near the spring’s clay banks, researchers reported in 2016 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Such conditions may reflect what it was like on early Earth, so these life-forms are most likely “related to some of the organisms that were originally on this planet,” says Jennifer Pett-Ridge, a microbial ecologist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.</p>





<p>Microorganisms at hot springs can form communities called microbial mats. Made up of layers of microbes, mats have been found in geothermal areas all over the world, including in Yellowstone National Park, the Garga hot spring in southern Russia and Lassen — home to Bumpass Hell.</p>



<p>Over time, microbial mats can form into stromatolites, structures of microbes and minerals that have accumulated on top of one another; the layered appearance of a stromatolite reflects the passage of time, like a tree’s growth rings. Researchers found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15263">evidence of stromatolites in the Dresser Formation</a>, a 3.5-billion–year-old rock feature in the Western Australia outback, along with evidence of hot spring mineral deposits, describing the findings in 2017 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These findings, plus other signs of past microbes, led the team to suggest that some of the earliest life on Earth flourished in a hot spring environment.</p>



<p>David Deamer, a biophysicist at UC Santa Cruz, has spent four and a half decades exploring how life on our planet may have begun. He started out studying lipids, oily molecules that make up the membranes surrounding cells. Deamer, a big proponent of hot springs as the source of life’s start, has shown that conditions at terrestrial hot springs can produce bubblelike vesicles, with an outer layer made up of lipids. Such structures may have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-scratch-0">the ancestral precursors of modern-day cells</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/10, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Bruce Damer, an astrobiologist at UC Santa Cruz who brings a computer science approach to questions about the origins of life, worked with Deamer to test whether conditions at hot springs could drive condensation reactions, which join two molecules into one larger composite.</p>



<p>When water splashes out of a hot spring and evaporates, molecules that were in the liquid could undergo condensation reactions and link up. A subsequent splash would add more molecules that could undergo additional condensation reactions as liquid dries again. Repeated rounds of wetting and drying could produce chains of molecules.</p>



<p>In 2018, Damer set up shop at an active geothermal area in New Zealand, named along the usual theme — Hells Gate — to test that hypothesis. He prepared vials with ingredients needed to assemble strands of RNA, a nucleic acid that acts as a messenger during protein synthesis and may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quite-switch">catalyzed chemical reactions involved in the origins of life on early Earth</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/04, p. 232</em>). The concoction included two of the four RNA building blocks — the nucleotides that link together to form RNA chains.</p>

Damer</span></figure></div>



<p>Damer stood the open vials in a metal block, roughly the size of two CD cases stacked together, and set the contraption into a near-boiling hydrothermal pool. To simulate the sometimes-wet, sometimes-dry burbling of the primordial Earth, Damer squirted acidic hot spring water into the vials, let them dry out and then repeated the wet-dry cycle several more times. When he brought the vials back to the lab, he found that they contained RNA-like strands that were 100 to 200 nucleotides long.</p>



<p>These results, reported in December 2019 in <em>Astrobiology</em>, indicate that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2018.1979">complex molecules can form at hot springs</a>, supporting the hypothesis that life on Earth may have developed in such an environment. In 2020, Damer returned to Hells Gate with Deamer and colleagues to confirm Damer’s results and do more wet-dry cycling studies.</p>



<p>Nicholas Hud, a chemist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, studies the origins of life from a slightly different perspective: He explores how DNA and RNA nucleotides originated. He agrees that molecules are more likely to link together by condensation reactions on land, where wet-dry cycles can occur, than in the ocean. These reactions produce water; the formation of such a chemical bond isn’t energetically favorable when there’s already a lot of water around. “The best place to form that is in a hot, dry place,” Hud says. “The worst place to form it is in a wet, hot place.”</p>

<h4>Underwater visions</h4>



<p>Yet, wet, hot environs are just the place for life to originate, other evidence suggests. At <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-hydrothermal-vents-more-abundant-thought">hydrothermal vents on the deep, dark ocean floor</a>, heated water spews into seawater that’s just a few degrees Celsius above freezing (<em>SN: 7/23/16, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>In 2017, researchers found fossils in 3.77-billion-year-old rocks from Quebec that originated from the ancient ocean floor and had signs of hydrothermal activity (<em>SN: 4/1/17, p. 6</em>). The researchers claim that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-microfossils-suggest-life-thrived-earth-about-4-billion-years-ago">distinct structures resemble those of microbes</a>, suggesting that deep-sea environments may have supported some of the earliest life on Earth.</p>



<p>These environments can be extreme: Some vents belch dark plumes of water as hot as 400° C. However, if vents played a role in nurturing early forms of life, it likely happened at milder vents. For example, Lost City is a hydrothermal area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where the fluid streaming from vents ranges in temperature from 40° to 90° C. The region is named for dramatic limestone chimneys that rise as much as 60 meters above the seafloor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a photo of a limestone chimney" class="wp-image-3091431" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-7_1030.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091431">The chemistry of vents like the limestone chimneys found at the Atlantic Ocean’s Lost City supports microbial life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091431">Courtesy of Susan Lang/Univ. of S. Carolina, NSF, ROV Jason/2018 © Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</span></figure>



<p>These spires are home to microbes that feed off the products of a chemical reaction known as serpentinization. “Hydrothermal vents are interesting because they are at the interface of water and rock,” says astrophysicist Laurie Barge of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<p>A chemical reaction between water and rock at sites like Lost City makes the water coming out of vents more alkaline than the water in the ocean, which has a higher concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions. The resulting gradient from alkaline to more acidic water is like the difference between the positive and negative ends of a battery and can serve as an energy source for chemical activity.</p>



<p>To study the conditions at underwater vents, Barge creates simulated environments in the lab that, she says, “can mimic what you see in the natural world.” To represent an ocean on early Earth, she fills an inverted glass bottle with an acidic mixture containing iron but no oxygen. One end of a plastic tube pokes through the narrow end of the bottle, connected to a steady supply of a basic, or alkaline, solution just like a vent.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="a still photo of a simulated alkaline hydrothermal vent" class="wp-image-3091428" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-5_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091428">NASA’s Laurie Barge simulates an alkaline hydrothermal vent in an acidic ocean to explore the chemistry of ancient oceans. The conditions produce chimney structures like the one above. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091428">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figure></div>



<p>When Barge and colleagues injected an alkaline vent solution containing RNA nucleotides into an ocean-simulating bottle, <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2014.1280">individual RNA nucleotides linked up into short chains</a>. These strands were only three or four nucleotides long, but the results suggest that the conditions at deep-sea vents could have supported reactions that led to the emergence of life on Earth, the researchers proposed in 2015 in <em>Astrobiology</em>.</p>



<h4>Problems with both</h4>



<p>To Deamer, there are big barriers to putting life’s pieces together near underwater vents: The vastness of the ocean would dilute molecules so they wouldn’t be concentrated enough to drive chemical reactions. Also, there are “no wet-dry cycles underwater.” In his view, repeated evaporation is needed to pull together enough molecules to bump into each other and react to form longer chains. Plus, unlike a hot spring’s freshwater, salty ocean water inhibits the formation of membranes and reactions that link together molecules, he says.</p>



<p>However, Deamer’s hot springs theory has its critics as well. DNA and RNA strands are composed of alternating phosphate and sugar molecules, but sugars “are profoundly unstable in hot spring environments,” says David Des Marais, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center.</p>



<p>And it may be too soon to rule out wet-dry cycles underwater. “You can have a little bit of water get stuck in a pore,” says Bill Brazelton, a marine microbiologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. And then, because the serpentinization reaction at a vent uses up water in making other molecules, “you can have these cycles of dehydration inside a rock underneath the ocean.”</p>



<p>It may be impossible to nail down how life truly began on Earth: Most geologic records of what actually happened during Earth’s earliest days have long disappeared. There are numerous alternative hypotheses for where life began, beyond terrestrial hot springs and deep-sea vents. Recent research, for example, suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">asteroid impacts could have sent superheated seawater into the crust</a> to produce hydrothermal systems resembling hot springs (<em>SN: 7/4/20, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>“I think we have to admit that there might be more than one little torturous path that might have been traversed in order for life to begin,” Des Marais says.</p>

<h4>Life beyond Earth</h4>



<p>Researchers are using what they’ve learned about how and where life may have originated on Earth to guide the search for biological signatures beyond our planet. There are several promising locales in our solar system.</p>



<p>“One of the things that NASA is really interested in knowing is whether or not there could be life in the subsurface oceans of the icy moons, like Europa and Enceladus,” says Batalha, of UC Santa Cruz. Scientists have evidence that the two moons, one orbiting Jupiter and the other, Saturn, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/table-salt-europa-jupiter-moon-underground-sea">oceans of salty, liquid water beneath their icy shells</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>These moons are intriguing because, along with liquid water, both have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/another-hint-europa-watery-plumes-found-20-year-old-galileo-data">plumes of water erupting from their surfaces</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 11</em>), suggesting ongoing hydrothermal activity. NASA’s Cassini space probe even identified compounds containing carbon, nitrogen and oxygen within Enceladus’ plumes, some of the ingredients of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Europa and Enceladus fascinate astronomers because activity on their ocean floors may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/somethings-cooking-enceladus">resemble the hydrothermal vents found on our own planet</a> and may provide the chemical conditions to support life (<em>SN: 4/18/15, p. 10</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="plumes of water vapor seen above Enceladus" class="wp-image-3091432" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-8_1030-800x421.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091432">Plumes of water vapor, plus compounds containing carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, spew from the frozen surface of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, as captured by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft. Hydrogen in the plumes is evidence of hydrothermal activity in the ocean beneath the ice, similar to deep-sea vents on Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091432">JPL-Caltech/NASA, Space Science Institute, Planetary Science Institute</span></figure>



<p>Icy moons may also promote condensation reactions. “Even if you were on an icy moon, you might have … freezing and thawing of ice,” Barge says. “So, I think it’s important to say, if wet-dry cycling is important, then we should look for any environment in the solar system that might be able to promote oscillating conditions of dehydration.”</p>



<p>But to find signs of past life, Damer and Deamer believe Mars is a more promising place to look. Mineral deposits indicate the presence of hot springs and hydrothermal activity in the planet’s past, which would have sustained the wetting and drying cycles that the two researchers see as crucial for condensation reactions to get life going.</p>



<p>Missions to the Red Planet are already under way. NASA’s Perseverance rover will be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">searching for signs of ancient life</a>, such as telltale minerals in rock samples, at Mars’ Jezero crater when the mission lands in February 2021 (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 30</em>). Though at least 54.6 million kilometers separate them, Mars and Bumpass Hell may not be so different.</p>

<p>To break the record for longest dive by a marine mammal, take a deep breath and jump in the water. Then don’t breathe in again for almost four hours.</p>



<p>Cuvier’s beaked whales (<em>Ziphius cavirostris) </em>are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beaked-whales-may-frequent-seabed-spot-marked-mining">master divers</a> (<em>SN: 08/21/18</em>). The creatures not only hold the record for deepest plunge by a marine mammal — measuring nearly 3,000 meters — but  also for the longest dives. In 2014, scientists documented one dive that lasted just over two hours at 137.5 minutes, setting <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092633">a record</a>. Another Cuvier’s beaked whale has now shattered that record, going <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/223/18/jeb222109">222 minutes</a>, or three hours and 42 minutes, without coming up for air, researchers report September 23 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.  </p>



<p>To last so long underwater, the mammals may rely on large stores of oxygen and a slow metabolism. Once oxygen runs out, the animals may have the ability to tolerate lactic acid building up in their muscles from anaerobic respiration — a method of generating energy that doesn’t rely on oxygen. “These guys blow our expectations,” says Nicola Quick, an animal behaviorist at Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C.</p>



<p>Calculations based on a seal’s oxygen stores and diving time limits hinted that the whales should last only about half an hour before running out of oxygen. Seals can exceed their limit about 5 percent of the time, so Quick’s team analyzed 3,680 dives by 23 whales. While most dives lasted around an hour, 5 percent exceeded about 78 minutes, suggesting it takes more than twice as long as thought for the whales to switch to anaerobic respiration.</p>



<p>The researchers expected to find that the whales spend more time at the surface recovering after long dives, but the team did not see a clear pattern. “We know very little about [the whales] at all,” Quick says, “which is interesting and frustrating at once.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-practically-irreversible-antarctic-melting">Global warming may lead to practically irreversible Antarctic melting</a></h4>

<p>How is melting a continent-sized ice sheet like stirring milk into coffee? Both are, for all practical purposes, irreversible.</p>



<p>In a new study published in the Sept. 24 <em>Nature</em>, researchers outline <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2727-5" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a series of temperature-related tipping points</a> for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Once each tipping point is reached, changes to the ice sheet and subsequent melting can’t be truly reversed, even if temperatures drop back down to current levels, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The full mass of ice sitting on top of Antarctica holds enough water to create about 58 meters of sea level rise. Although the ice sheet won’t fully collapse tomorrow or even in the next century, Antarctic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-lost-3-trillion-metric-tons-ice-since-1992-sea-level-rise">ice loss is accelerating</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/18</em>). So scientists are keen to understand the processes by which such a collapse might occur.</p>



<p>“What we’re really interested in is the long-term stability” of the ice, says Ricarda Winkelmann, a climate scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. In the new study, Winkelmann and her colleagues simulated how future temperature increases can lead to changes across Antarctica in the interplay between ice, oceans, atmosphere and land.</p>





<p>In addition to direct melting due to warming, numerous processes linked to climate change can speed up overall melting, called positive feedbacks, or slow it down, known as negative feedbacks.</p>



<p>For example, as the tops of the ice sheets slowly melt down to lower elevations, the air around them becomes progressively warmer, speeding up melting. Warming temperatures also soften the ice itself, so that it slides more quickly toward the sea. And ocean waters that have absorbed heat from the atmosphere can transfer that heat to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-warm-water-sea-level-climate">vulnerable underbellies of Antarctic glaciers</a> jutting into the sea, eating away at the buttresses of ice that keep the glaciers from sliding into the sea (<em>SN: 9/11/20</em>). The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is particularly vulnerable to such ocean interactions — but warm waters are also threatening sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-may-be-driving-melting-east-antarctica-totten-glacier">Totten Glacier</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/17</em>).</p>



<p>In addition to these positive feedbacks, climate change can produce some negative feedbacks that delay the loss of ice. For example, warmer atmospheric temperatures also evaporate more ocean water, adding moisture to the air and producing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-antarctica-are-gaining-ice-inland-losing-melting-overall">increased snowfall</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new study suggests that below 1 degree Celsius of warming relative to preindustrial times, increased snowfall slightly increases the mass of ice on the continent, briefly outpacing overall losses. But that’s where the good news ends. Simulations suggest that after about 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will become unstable and collapse, primarily due to its interactions with warm ocean waters, increasing sea levels by more than 2 meters. That’s a warming target that the signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement pledged not to exceed, but which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">the world is on track to surpass</a> by 2100 (<em>SN: 11/26/2019</em>).</p>



<p>As the planet continues to warm, some East Antarctic glaciers will follow suit. At 6 degrees Celsius of warming, “we reach a point where surface processes become dominant,” Winkelmann says. In other words, the ice surface is now at low enough elevation to accelerate melting. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming, more than 70 percent of the total ice mass in Antarctica is loss, corresponding to an eventual sea level rise of more than 40 meters, the team found.</p>



<p>Those losses in ice can’t be regained, even if temperatures return to preindustrial levels, the study suggests. The simulations indicate that for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to regrow to its modern extent, temperatures would need to drop to at least 1 degree Celsius below preindustrial times.</p>



<p>“What we lose might be lost forever,” Winkelmann says.</p>



<p>There are other possible feedback mechanisms, both positive and negative, that weren’t included in these simulations, Winklemann adds — either because the mechanisms are negligible or because their impacts aren’t yet well understood. These include interactions with ocean-climate patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and with ocean circulation patterns, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets might <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0889-9">also play complicated feedback roles</a>. Nicholas Golledge, a climate scientist with Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2019 that flows of Greenland meltwater can slow ocean circulation in the Atlantic, while cold, fresh Antarctic meltwater can act like a seal on the surface ocean around the continent, trapping warmer, saltier waters below, where they can continue to eat away at the underbelly of glaciers.</p>



<p>In a separate study published Sept. 23 in <em>Science Advances</em>, Shaina Sadai, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and her colleagues also examined the impact of Antarctic meltwater. In simulations that look out to the year 2250, the researchers found that in addition to a cool meltwater layer trapping warm water below it, that surface layer of freshwater would exert a strong cooling effect that could boost the volume of sea ice around Antarctica, which would in turn also keep the air there colder.</p>



<p>A large plug of such meltwater, such as due to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet’s sudden collapse, could even briefly <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.%20eaaz1169">slow global warming</a>, the researchers found. But that boon would come at a terrible price: rapid sea level rise, Sadai says. “This is not good news,” she adds. “We do not want a delayed surface temperature rise at the cost of coastal communities.”</p>



<p>Because the volume and impact of meltwater is still uncertain, Winkelmann’s team didn’t include this factor. Robert DeConto, an atmospheric scientist also at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a coauthor on the <em>Science Advances</em> study, notes that the effect depends on how scientists choose to simulate how the ice breaks apart. The study’s large meltwater volumes are the result of a controversial idea known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change">marine ice-cliff hypothesis</a>, which suggests that in a few centuries, tall ice cliffs in Antarctica might become brittle enough to suddenly crumble into the ocean like dominoes, raising sea levels catastrophically (<em>SN: 2/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>Despite lingering uncertainties over the magnitude of feedbacks, one emerging theme — highlighted by the <em>Nature</em> paper — is consistent, DeConto says: Once the ice is lost, we can’t go back.</p>



<p>“Even if we get our act together and reduce emissions dramatically, we will have already put a lot of heat into the ocean,” he adds. For ice to begin to grow back, “we’ll have to go back to a climate that’s colder than at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, sort of like the next ice age. And that’s sobering.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mother-mouse-gut-microbes-microbiome-pup-brain">A mother mouse’s gut microbes help wire her pup’s brain</a></h4>

<p>New findings in mice suggest yet another role for gut microbes, even before birth.</p>



<p>The microbes residing in a female mouse’s gut <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2745-3">help shape the wiring of her offspring’s brain</a>, researchers report September 23 in <em>Nature. </em>While mouse and human development are worlds apart, the study hints at how a mother’s microbiome may have long-term consequences for her offspring.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously found links between a mouse mother’s microbiome and her young’s brain and behavior, but many of those studies worked with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaginal-microbes-mice-transfer-stress-their-pups">animals that were stressed</a> (<em>SN: 7/9/18</em>) or sick. Instead, Helen Vuong, a neurobiologist at UCLA, and her colleagues looked at what a mother’s microbial mix normally does for her pups’ brains.</p>



<p>The new results point to the influence of specific microbes and the small molecules they produce, called metabolites. “Metabolites from the microbiome of the mother can influence the developing brain of the fetus,” says Cathryn Nagler, an immunologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study. The metabolites do this by reaching a developing pup’s brain where they affect the growth of axons, she says. Axons are the threadlike signal-transmitters of nerve cells.</p>





<p>Vuong and her team looked at the brains of fetuses from pregnant mice — some with their usual gut bugs, some raised without microbes and others ridded of their gut bacteria with antibiotics. When a mother’s microbes were missing, fetuses had shorter and fewer axons extending from the brain’s “relay station” to the cortex, Vuong says. These connections are important for processing sensory information.</p>



<p>Those brain differences appear to have consequences for mice later in life. As adults, mice born to microbe-deficient mothers were less sensitive to touch than mice from mothers with a typical microbiome. For instance, in one of several sensory tests, mice from microbe-deficient mothers took longer to notice a small piece of tape stuck to one of their paws. But when microbe-lacking females were given <em>Clostridia</em> bacteria, their offspring’s brain and behavior developed normally. <em>Clostridia</em> are common gut microbes in humans and in mice, Nagler says, and their absence has been linked to some noncommunicable conditions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gut-bacteria-may-prevent-food-allergies">such as food allergies</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/14</em>).</p>



<p>Small molecules made by the gut bugs may account for this effect. The researchers found that levels of several metabolites in mom’s blood were linked to levels in the fetal blood and brain. “It’s kind of cool that it’s crossing different sites from the mom all the way to the fetus,” Vuong says. That suggests mom shares her gut metabolites with her young.</p>



<p>When pregnant mice with altered microbiomes received supplements of some of those metabolites, their pups’ behavior developed normally. It’s not clear yet how gut microbes and metabolites could be involved in human brain development. Still, this “points now to a way that one might think about intervening,” if pregnant women have deficient microbiomes, says Nagler, who is president of ClostraBio, a company that’s exploring metabolite treatments for diseases related to the immune system. Instead of trying to alter those microbiomes, which can be difficult, pregnant women could receive the needed metabolites directly.</p>



<p>“It will be really important to understand whether these negative effects also happen in humans and whether they lead to long-term medical concerns,” says Carolina Tropini, a microbiologist and biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not part of the work. Researchers will need to study how the short-term benefits of antibiotics stack up against potential risks, she says, but such research may also lead to therapies for pregnant women who need antibiotics.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-eht-data-m87-black-hole-turbulence-wobble">EHT data show turbulence makes the glowing ring around M87’s black hole wobble</a></h4>

<p>Astrophysicists have gotten their first direct view of a supermassive black hole’s appearance changing over time. </p>



<p>The black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, about 55 million light-years away from Earth, was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first black hole to get its picture taken</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That image, created using Event Horizon Telescope data from April 2017, showed a lopsided ring of light: the black hole’s shadow on the accretion disk of hot, glowing plasma swirling into it. A new comparison of that image with earlier Event Horizon Telescope data reveals that the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abac0d">brightest spot on the ring changes location</a>, due to turbulence in the violent eddy of material around the black hole, researchers report online September 23 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a very exciting result,” says astrophysicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved in the study. “The first image that they produced was just a snapshot. What we would really like to do is understand more of the dynamics of what’s going on at the center of that galaxy.”</p>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">network of radio telescopes</a> that, together, make much higher resolution observations than any observatory could alone (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). An early version of the EHT began observing M87’s black hole, dubbed M87*, in 2009. Back then, the network included telescopes at only three sites in Arizona, Hawaii and California. In 2013, an observatory in Chile joined the team. But the network did not have enough telescopes to create a complete black hole image until 2017, when the EHT peered at M87* with seven observatories across North America, South America, Hawaii and Europe.</p>





<p>Using the 2017 image of M87* as a starting point for the black hole’s appearance, along with preliminary data from 2009 to 2013 to fill in some of the details, the EHT team was able to get a rough idea of what M87* looked like during the early years of EHT observation.</p>



<p>Although the black hole’s diameter remained the same, the brightest spot on the ring swiveled. The ring’s right side was brightest in 2013, while the bottom was brightest in 2017. “I think many people in the [EHT] collaboration were surprised by the amount of variability,” says EHT team member Maciek Wielgus, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. The ring’s uneven glimmer arises from the tumultuous flow of superhot plasma around the black hole.</p>

Researchers compared the real image (far right), created from observations taken in 2017, with simulations of what the black hole looked like earlier based on preliminary data from 2009 to 2013. The changes are due to turbulence in the tempest of material swirling into the black hole.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091698">M. Wielgus, D. Pesce</span></figure>



<p>This turbulence in the accretion disk — and therefore the variation in the ring’s appearance — is expected to depend on factors like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spin-may-reveal-black-hole-history">how fast the black hole is spinning</a>, the tilt of its rotation and the strength of its magnetic fields, says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale University, who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 1/30/17</em>). Monitoring changes in M87*’s appearance may reveal new information about the nature of the black hole.</p>



<p>The new results show the promise of using the EHT to probe the tempest around M87*, says Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who was not involved in the work. But the rough sketches of the black hole’s appearance from 2009 to 2013 do not contain enough information to draw firm conclusions about what is going on in this chaotic region, he says.</p>



<p>The EHT team will need more full images of M87*, like the one created from 2017 data, to uncover detailed changes over time. That series of still images could also be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-top-science-stories-2019-yir">create an M87* movie</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>).</p>



<p>The EHT team is currently analyzing data collected in 2018, including observations from a newcomer to the EHT network, the Greenland Telescope. The EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-coronavirus">did not observe in 2019 or 2020</a>, but “we will be observing in 2021, COVID permitting,” says EHT team member Geoffrey Bower, an astrophysicist at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Hilo, Hawaii (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). “We expect to have incredible imaging quality out of those 2021 data,” he says, because by then the EHT will have two more eyes on the sky: the Kitt Peak observatory in Arizona and the NOEMA array in the French Alps. “I think that’s really going to get at the heart of turbulence in the accretion region,” he says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We all know that it’s vital that we take action to reduce the harm we do to the environment. So understanding the barriers to such action is critical, too. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220948712">new paper</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, identifies a potentially important one: when people believe that it’s important to protect the environment, they’re less likely to act on those beliefs if they’re more religious.</p>


<p><span id="more-40369"></span></p>


<p>Kimin Eom at Singapore Management University and colleagues studied Americans — and when they talk about people being “religious”, they’re really talking about being Christian. These caveats are important to highlight up front.</p>



<p>In the first of three studies, the team analysed pre-existing data on a nationally representative sample of 3,052 US adults. They looked specifically at answers to three categories of questions. Firstly, questions assessed how strongly an individual endorsed the ideas that a) the world is getting hotter; and b) human activity is an important driver of this. Secondly, questions related to “religiosity” — a) their belief in the importance of religion; and b) how often they attend religious services. Finally, the team looked at responses to questions that assessed their level of support for pro-environmental policies.</p>



<p>The researchers found that climate change beliefs predicted support for pro-environmental policy less strongly among individuals higher in religiosity. In other words, “These results supported the idea that environmental beliefs are less in line with pro-environmental support among those who are more, relative to less, religious.” These results held even when team took into account/controlled for a range of demographic variables, including political orientation, gender, income, education, age and ethnicity.</p>



<p>In a second study, the team dug deeper into this finding. A total of 424 US students, half from a Christian college and half from a non-religious public university, both in California, completed a series of questionnaires. The first scale explored the extent to which they believed in climate change. The second measured religiosity. The third measured how strongly the participants believed in a “controlling god” — a god who has a plan and controls events in the world. They were then asked to report how often they would perform six environmentally friendly behaviours (such as buying green products instead of regular products and unplugging appliances at night) over the next six months.</p>



<p>The participants also gave demographic data — and a few potentially important differences between the groups stood out. Namely, the Christian college students were more likely to be Republican and there were fewer women in the Christian group. The team took these group differences into account in their analysis, which revealed that higher religiosity was associated with a stronger belief in a controlling god — and it was the strength of this belief (rather than religiosity per se) that affected their intentions to act in a more environmentally friendly way. (Those with the strongest beliefs in a controlling god were the least likely to indicate that they’d be engaging in such behaviours.)</p>



<p>Why should this be the case? The authors argue that, if you believe that a god controls what happens in the world, you are less likely to think that any actions that you take will change any given outcome — and so you are less likely to change your behaviour.</p>



<p>The results from these studies were correlational, however. To explore the idea that belief in a controlling god makes people less likely to act to help the environment, the team ran a third study with 730 Christians. The team measured their environmental beliefs as before. Half then read a passage that described God as the ultimate controller of the world. This was designed to prime them with the idea that God is controlling. The other read an article about why Pluto had been declassified as a planet (a text chosen to have no influence on attitudes to God). Participants also rated the extent to which four adjectives (controlling, commanding, caring, compassionate ) described a god. Next, their intentions to behave in a pro-environmental way were assessed (as in the previous study) and they provided demographic data.</p>



<p>Climate change beliefs predicted intentions to behave pro-environmentally less strongly when a participant had a stronger concept of God as being controlling. Or to put it another way, believing in a controlling god “weakens the association between environmental beliefs and pro-environmental support”. This study confirms that it’s the belief in a controlling god, rather than a belief in God per se, that weakens that association, the team argues.</p>



<p>As already noted, though, the religious people in this study were Christians, and they were all American. So the findings may or may not extend to people with other religious beliefs. Also, these studies featured a lot of self-report and assessments of “intention” to act. It would of course be interesting to know whether belief in a controlling god makes any difference to actual, real world behaviour.</p>



<p>However, as the researchers also point out, when it comes to understanding which sociocultural factors influence environmental attitudes and behaviour, there is still a lot to learn. This work at least starts to plug part of that gap.  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-immune-responses-young-people-covid19-coronavirus">Early immune responses may be why younger people get less sick from COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>One of the lingering questions of the pandemic is why COVID-19 symptoms tend to be milder in children and young adults than in older people. A new study suggests that the immune systems of people younger than 24 deal the coronavirus a strong first punch. Those early immune defenses, which set off alarm bells for the body to go on the attack no matter what the invader, may be weaker in older adults.</p>



<p>Having more muted frontline defenses could allow an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, get a foothold, resulting in <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/09/21/scitranslmed.abd5487">worse symptoms for older people</a>, researchers report September 21 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The results add to evidence that boosting early immune responses to the virus with a vaccine or drugs like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">interferons</a> — which are based on proteins the body produces to stimulate immune cells — could help protect people (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers have had some ideas why younger people generally get less sick. It’s possible that compared with adults and older kids, younger children have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks">lower amounts of the ACE2 protein</a> in their upper respiratory tracts. That’s a protein that the virus uses to break into cells (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Another explanation could have been that young people have less virus in their bodies, which could mean milder symptoms, although studies have shown that viral load is similar across people no matter their age. Or differences in the immune system, which tends to become less robust with age, could play a role.</p>

<p>In the new study, pediatric infectious diseases physician and virologist Betsy Herold and colleagues divided 125 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City into five categories. People younger than 24 were split into three groups: those with symptoms who did not need a ventilator, those that did need ventilation and a third group that included kids who developed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-parents-summer">coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome</a> that mainly affects children younger than 5 (<em>SN:6/3/20</em>). Adult patients older than 24 fell into two groups: people who needed a ventilator or died and those who recovered.</p>



<p>When the team compared the immune responses among groups, it found that younger people, including those with the inflammatory syndrome, had higher amounts of an immune signaling molecule called IL-17A than older adults. That protein is typically associated with T cells — immune cells that recognize fragments of specific viruses and can kill infected cells or help activate other parts of the immune system. T cells normally are part of a second wave of defense launched by the immune system.</p>



<p>But IL-17A is also produced by immune cells from the body’s first line of defense. Both older and younger people had similar numbers of T cells linked to the signaling molecule. That means the abundance of IL-17A seen in young people likely came from immune cells tied to the body’s early defenses against the virus, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Compared with adults who had severe COVID-19, younger patients who did not need a ventilator also had lower levels of other immune signaling proteins involved in inflammation, like one called IL-6 that has been linked to an overactive immune response. That overreaction is responsible for severe symptoms in many of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>





<p>One potential issue with the study is that the results weren’t adjusted for underlying conditions, says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. Adults in the study were more likely to have high-risk conditions like diabetes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable">high blood pressure</a>, which could help explain the differences in disease compared with younger people (<em>SN: 3/20/20</em>).</p>



<p>Older adults did ultimately mount a stronger virus-specific immune response later in infection, compared with younger people. How helpful that response actually is remains unknown. Older adults, especially those on a ventilator or who had died, had a stronger response of T cells that recognized a protein on the virus’ surface, called the spike, compared with younger people. People older than 24 also made more antibodies that prevent the virus from infecting new cells, called neutralizing antibodies.</p>



<p>“It’s not that [adults] can’t make a neutralizing antibody response,” says Herold, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. “It’s not that they can’t make a good T cell response. Maybe they make too much of [a late immune response] or a dysregulated one.”</p>



<p>The fact that severely ill adults had more T cells than younger people is interesting, Slifka says, in part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-t-cells-patients-immune-system">the role those immune cells</a> have in COVID-19 is still unclear (<em>SN: 5/15/20</em>). In the study, a high T cell response wasn’t associated with mild disease, hinting that those responses weren’t necessarily protective, Slifka says. But studies need to be done with more patients to know for sure. “We’re still trying to figure out if T cells play a role in protection,” he says.  </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conversations about race are not always easy, as the writer Reni Eddo-Lodge has recently explored in her brilliant book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race"><em>Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race</em></a>. But they’re no less necessary for it: not talking about racism is simply not an option, particularly for those of us who benefit from structural inequality.</p>



<p>We all have a part to play in this ongoing dialogue — including parents of children growing up in a world full of <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/bps-statement-racial-injustice">racial injustice</a>. Previous research has suggested that constructive conversations about race and ethnicity can have positive outcomes for children of all races — increased empathy, an ability to learn about and accept different perspectives, a better understanding of their own identity, and less racial bias.</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-57182-001">new paper</a> from Jessica Sullivan at Skidmore College and colleagues, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, suggests that those crucial conversations are being delayed — because parents are misjudging their children’s ability to process and understand race.</p>


<p><span id="more-40359"></span></p>


<p>In the first two studies, the researchers asked almost 1,200 participants to indicate on a sliding scale the earliest age at which they would talk to children about race. Participants also stated what age, in months, they believed children developed certain behaviours and abilities. These questions focused on three areas: development of behaviours around race (e.g. the age at which children begin to prefer faces from their own racial groups), social development (e.g. the age at which children can tell faces from non-faces), and general development (e.g. the age at which children can recognise their mother’s voice). Some were about relatively less complex processes, such as recognising faces of different races, while others concerned higher level processes, such as inferring the status of group members by race.</p>



<p>Compared to the best estimate from scientific research, participants were out by less than a year in their estimates of children’s general development and by two years for social development — but by four years for race questions, vastly overestimating the age that children begin to develop race-related capacities. Participants also stated that conversations about race should first happen around a child’s fifth birthday, and their beliefs weren’t influenced by their race, age, sex, experience with children or how diverse their everyday environment is.</p>



<p>The third study looked at the causal relationship between these factors — if participants had better knowledge of developmental milestones, would it increase their willingness to talk to children about race at an earlier age? To find out, the team randomly assigned 328 participants to one of three categories in which they saw pieces of information related to either children’s ability to understand race (e.g. “Babies spontaneously prefer faces from particular racial groups at around three months of age”), adult interpretation of race, and general child development.</p>



<p>It seemed to work. Those who read facts about children’s abilities to understand race estimated the age of development of these capacities at less than 18 months from the best scientific estimates — and they endorsed discussing race with children a year earlier than participants who learned about adults and race.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s unclear when the optimal age to start talking to children about race is, but given that increased knowledge was certainly good for adults, it makes sense that children would benefit from explicit conversations too, as previous research has shown.</p>



<p>A better understanding of <em>how</em> to talk about race with children might also help. Another recent paper, written by Katharine E. Scott and a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620927702"><em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em></a>, found scant evidence for the effectiveness of various parental interventions for reducing racial biases in children, and called for other researchers to develop “supported, specific, shareable suggestions” for parents wanting to engage their children in conversations about race.</p>



<p>It would also be useful to explore differences in approaches in such conversations between parents of different races: although in this study participant race made no difference to knowledge about children’s developmental milestones, the team acknowledges that a Black family is unlikely to talk about race in the same way as a White family.</p>



<p>What we know for sure is that children are growing up in a heavily racialised world — and it’s children of colour who are feeling the brunt of that, experiencing racial discrimination well before they even reach adolescence. Having simple conversations with your children can’t undo structural inequality — but it should be considered a vital part of children’s socialisation. </p>



<p>– <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-57182-001">Adults delay conversations about race because they underestimate children’s processing of race.</a></p>

<p>Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record from many neurons simultaneously. But what do the recorded signals really mean?</p>



<p>This question can only be properly addressed by experiments which record both calcium signals and action potentials from the same neuron (ground truth recordings). These recordings are technically quite challenging. So we assembled several existing ground truth datasets, and in addition recorded ground truth datasets ourselves, totaling &gt;200 neuronal recordings.</p>



<p>This blog blog posts contains raw movies together with recorded action potentials (black; also turn on your speakers for the spikes!) and the recorded ΔF/F of the calcium recording (blue). These ground truth data are a very direct way for everybody into calcium imaging to get an intuition about what is really going on. (Scroll down if you want to see recordings in zebrafish!)</p>

<p>Something completely different: recording from a pyramidal neuron in Ca3 with <strong>R-CaMP1.07</strong>, virally induced, recorded by Stefano Carta, from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. What appears as single events are actually bursts of 5-15 action potentials with inter-spike-intervals of &lt;6 ms.</p>

<p>A recording that I performed myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (aDp) with <strong>GCaMP6f</strong>, tg(neuroD), in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Around second 20, it is visible that even a single action potential can be seen in the calcium signal. However,this was not always the case in other neurons that I recorded from the same brain region.</p>

<p>What can you do if you want to detect single isolated action potentials with calcium imaging? GCaMP, due to its sigmoid non-linearity, is by often a bad choice and will be strongly biased towards bursts. Synthetic indicators, however, are very linear in the low-calcium regime. – This is a recording that I did myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>OGB-1</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Although the temporal resolution of the calcium recording is rather low, the indicator clearly responds to single action potentials. As another asset, the indicator not only fills the cytoplasm of the neuron in a ring-like shape, which makes neuropil-contamination much less of an issue compared to GCaMPs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Another recording that I performed in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>Cal-520</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. This indicator is much more sensitive compared to OGB-1, but also diffuses less well after bolus injection. – These two minutes of recording only contain 4 spikes (this brain region really is into low firing rates in general), but you can clearly see all of them. If this were a GCaMP recording, you would probably see only a flat line throughout the entire recording.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many of us are faced with daily temptations to cheat. You might be offered the chance to download pirated music, perhaps. Or you might wonder about passing your child off as younger than they are, to avoid buying them a ticket on public transport.</p>



<p>As the authors of a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19080.short?rss=1">new paper</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, point out, several lines of research propose that cognitive control is needed for us to resolve the conflict between wanting to cheat and wanting to be honest. We need, in other words, to make an effort to rein in our impulses. However, the new work, led by Sebastian Speer at Erasmus University in the Netherlands, shows that this means different things for different people. If you’re typically honest, cognitive control can turn you into a cheat.</p>


<p><span id="more-40350"></span></p>


<p>The team recruited 40 young adults (aged 18-35) who were told they were taking part in a study into visual search (a later survey confirmed that none realised it was really about cheating). While in an MRI scanner, they were shown a series of pairs of “spot the difference” images — the sort you can find in any kids’ puzzle book. They were told that there were three differences between each pair (the colour in one region might be different in one of the images, for example, or an item included in one was missing from the other).</p>



<p>All that participants had to do was signal if and when they’d spotted these three differences, and they’d receive a small monetary reward. If they couldn’t find the three differences, they were not to signal. However, in only half the trials were there actually three differences. In a quarter of the trials, there were only two differences, and in the final quarter, there was only one. The participants had, then, regular opportunities to cheat — to report that they’d spotted three differences to gain the money, even though half the time this was impossible. The potential benefits weren’t small: a participant who cheated whenever they had the chance would earn about €35 vs €7.50 for someone who was always honest. And as far as the participants knew, the researchers would be oblivious to this cheating.</p>



<p>The researchers were, however, able to monitor not only all instances of cheating but also each participant’s brain activity through each of the trials. And their analysis of the data revealed a series of fascinating results:</p>



<ul><li> There was a big range in cheating behaviour: 17.5% of participants cheated on only one or two trials whereas 5% missed only one or two opportunities to cheat, with the rest falling somewhere in between.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The group was then divided into “honest” types (who cheated relatively infrequently) and “cheaters” (who cheated relatively often). And the team found that when faced with the opportunity to cheat, the honest ones showed greater activation of the “self-referential thinking network”. Our self-concepts are represented by this network, which includes the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junctions. The results suggest, then, that a more honest individual’s self-concept as being an “honest” person became relevant to their decision about whether to cheat or not. There was stronger connectivity within this network when they actually then behaved honestly vs dishonestly.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Cheaters showed stronger sensitivity to the prospect of financial reward than the honest types (as indicated by higher levels of activity in the nucleus accumbens, which plays a central role in the reward circuit); as the team explains, this means that cheaters “were more strongly driven by reward when making the decision whether to cheat or not”.</li></ul>



<ul><li>For cheaters, more cognitive control (represented by higher levels of activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex) was needed to overcome their tendency to be dishonest, whereas for honest types, more cognitive control was needed for them to overcome their tendency not to cheat, and dishonestly claim a payment.</li></ul>



<p>Earlier studies into the role of cognitive control in regulating cheating behaviour have produced conflicting results. These new findings explain why: “Our results suggest that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se but that it depends on an individual’s moral default…cognitive control allows honest people to cheat at times, whereas it enables cheaters to sometimes be honest.”</p>



<p>Why would honest types want to overcome their honest impulses? Because, as the researchers note, it’s possible to strike a balance between being an “honest” person and also one who takes an opportunity to profit from cheating from time to time. But as we don’t like to change our self-concepts, and try to avoid this happening, honest people have to make an effort to overcome this barrier and cheat.</p>



<p>There are of course huge economic costs to dishonest behaviour, and major campaigns to discourage people from fare-dodging, for example. “These findings may prove to be useful for developing interventions targeted at reducing cheating and dishonesty,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>This may well be the case, but the results certainly suggest that there won’t be a one-size-fits-all solution. Clearly, different things can drive people towards honesty — or the reverse.</p>

<p>In 1990 Glendon MacGregor, a restaurant waiter in Pretoria, South Africa, set up an elaborate hoax in which he posed as the crown prince of Liechtenstein to organize for himself a state visit to his own country. Amazingly, the ruse lasted for two weeks, and during that time MacGregor was wined and dined by numerous South African dignitaries. He had a blast in his home town, living it up in a posh hotel, and enjoying a trip to see the Blue Bulls in Loftus Versfeld stadium. The story is the subject of  the 1993 Afrikaans film “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438954/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Die Prins van Pretoria</a>” (The Prince of Pretoria). Now, another Pretorian is at it, except this time not for two weeks but for several months. And, unlike MacGregor’s hoax, this one does not just embarrass a government and leave it with a handful of hotel and restaurant bills. This hoax risks lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Levitt</a>, a Stanford University Professor of structural biology and winner of  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013, wants you to believe the COVID-19 pandemic is over in the US. He claimed it <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1287036738565738496?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ended on August 22nd, with a total of 170,000 deaths</a> (there are now over 200,000 with hundreds of deaths per day). He claims those 170,000 deaths <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1262799080402628608?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weren’t even COVID-19 deaths</a>, and since <a href="https://cdnwp.tonyrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EuroMOMO_Influenza_and_COVID19_Have_Similar_Total_and_Age_Range_Excess_Deaths.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the virus is not very dangerous</a>, he suggests you infect yourself. How? <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1278561306006691845?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He proposes you set sail on a COVID-19 cruise</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Sea world's largest cruise ship under  construction - Business Insider" class="aligncenter" height="377" src="https://i.insider.com/5f5a54307ed0ee001e25e8b1?width=1100&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" width="503" /></p>
<p>Levitt’s lunacy began with an attempt to save the world from epidemiologists. Levitt presumably figured this would not be a difficult undertaking, because, he has noted, <span style="font-size: inherit;">“<a href="https://twitter.com/gummibear737/status/1279167888038023170?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">epidemiologists see their job not as getting things correct</a>“. I guess he figured that he could do better than <em>that</em>.</span> On<span style="font-size: inherit;"> February 25th of this year, at a time when there had already been 2,663 deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China but before the World Health Organization had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, he delivered what sounded like good news. </span><a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/25/WS5e545c76a310128217279f34.html" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">He predicted that the virus had almost run its course</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, and that the final death toll in China would be 3,250. This turned out to be a somewhat optimistic prediction. As of the writing of this post (September 21, 2020), there have been 4,634 reported COVID-19 deaths in China, and there is reason to believe that the actual number of deaths has been far higher (see, e.g. </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116012v2" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">He et al., 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30089-X/fulltext" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">Tsang et al., 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">Wadham and Jacobs, 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">).</span></p>
<p>Instead of publishing his methods or waiting to evaluate the veracity of his claims, Levitt signed up for multiple media interviews. Emboldened by “interest in his work” (who doesn’t want to interview a Nobel laureate?), he started making more predictions of the form “COVID-19 is not a threat and the pandemic is over”. On March 20th he said that “<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/nobel-laureate-israel-will-have-no-more-than-ten-coronavirus-deaths-621407" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he will be surprised if the number of deaths in Israel surpasses 10</a>“. Unfortunately, there have been 1,256 COVID-19 deaths in Israel so far with a massive increase in cases over the past few weeks and no end to the pandemic in sight. On March 28th, when Switzerland had 197 deaths, he <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243929765876301825?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">predicted the pandemic was almost over and would end with 250</a>. Switzerland are now seen 1,762 deaths and <a href="https://www.thelocal.ch/20200915/worst-infection-rate-in-switzerland-vaud-to-introduce-new-lockdown-measures-from-thursday" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent dramatic increase in cases has overwhelmed hospitals in some regions leading to new lockdown measures</a>. Levitt’s predictions have come loose and fast. On June 28th <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1277278261979090945?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he predicted deaths in Brazil would plateau at 98,000</a>. There have been over 137,000 deaths in Brazil with hundreds of people dying every day now. In Italy he predicted on March 28th that <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243905625714831363?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the pandemic was past its midpoint and deaths would end at 17,000 – 20,000.</a> There have now been 35,707 deaths in Italy. The way he described the situation in the country at the time, when <a href="https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/surprising-reason-northern-italy-crematoria-are-overwhelmed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crematoria were overwhelmed</a>, was “normal”.</p>
<p>I became aware of Levitt’s predictions via an email list of the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscb-fellows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fellows of the International Society of Computational Biology</a> on March 14th. I’ve been a Fellow for 3 years, and during this time I’ve received hardly any mail, except during Fellow nomination season. It was therefore somewhat of a surprise to start receiving emails from Michael Levitt regarding COVID-19, but it was a time when scientists were scrambling to figure out how they could help with the pandemic and I was excited at the prospect of all of us learning from each other and possibly helping out. Levitt began by sending around a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/am2437ywxnh4b84/CURRENT.Analysis_of_Coronavirus-2019_Data_Michael_Levitt.pdf?dl=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF via a Dropbox link</a> and asked for feedback. I wrote back right away suggesting he distribute the code used to make the figures, make clear the exact versions of data he was scraping to get the results (with dates and copies so the work could be replicated), suggested he add references and noted there were several typos (e.g. the formula <img alt="D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_n+%3D+C_nP_0+%2B+C_%7Bn-1%7DP_1+%2B+C_%7Bn-2%7DP_2+%2B+%5Cldots+%2B+C_%7Bn-29%7DP_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0" title="D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2" /> clearly had wrong indices). I asked that he post it on the bioRxiv so it could receive community feedback, and suggested he fill in some details so I and others could better evaluate the methods (e.g. I pointed out that I thought the use of a Gaussian for <img alt="P_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0" title="P_n" /> was problematic).</p>
<p>The initial correspondence rapidly turned into a flurry of email on the ISCB Fellows list. Levitt was full of advice. He suggested everyone wear a mask and I and others pushed back noting, as Dr. Anthony Fauci did at the time, that there was a severe shortage of masks and they should go to doctors first. Several exchanges centered on who to blame for the pandemic (one Fellow suggested immigrants in Italy). Among all of this, there was one constant: Levitt’s COVID-19 advice and predictions kept on coming, and without reflection or response to the well-meaning critiques. After Levitt said he’d be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths in Israel, and after he refused to send code reproducing his analyses, or post a preprint, I urged my fellow Fellows in ISCB to release a statement distancing our organization from his opinions, and emphasizing the need for rigorous, reproducible work. I was admonished by two colleagues and told, in so many words, to shut up. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Levitt did not shut up. In March, after talking to Israeli newspapers about how he would be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-expert-who-says-israel-is-overreacting-to-coronavirus-1.8689010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he spoke directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> to deliver his message that Israel was overreacting to the virus (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ioannidis-trump-white-house-coronavirus-lockdowns" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he tried to speak to US president Donald Trump as well</a>). Israel is now in a very dangerous situation with COVID-19 out of control. It has the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-highest-rate-in-world-of-new-coronavirus-infections-per-capita-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest number of cases per capita in the world</a>. Did Levitt play a role in this by helping to convince Netanyahu to ease restrictions in the country in May? We may never know. <a href="https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1301637529406496770?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There were likely many factors</a> contributing to Israel’s current tragedy but Levitt, by virtue of speaking directly to Netanyahu, should be scrutinized for his actions. What we do know is that at the time, he was making predictions about the nature and expected course of the virus with unpublished methods (i.e. not even preprinted), poorly documented data, and without any possibility for anyone to reproduce any of his work. <span style="font-size: inherit;">His disgraceful scholarship has not improved in the subsequent months. He did, eventually post a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preprint</a>, but the data tab states “all data to be made available” and there is the following paragraph relating to availability of code: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to make the computer codes we use available to all but these are currently written in a variety of languages that few would want to use. While Dr. Scaiewicz uses clean self-documenting Jupyter Python notebook code, Dr. Levitt still develops in a FORTRAN dialect call Mortran (Mortran 1975) that he has used since 1980. The Mortran preprocessor produces Fortran that is then converted to C-code using f2c. This code is at least a hundred-fold faster than Python code. His other favorite language is more modern, but involves the use of the now deprecated language Perl and Unix shell scripts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the methods proposed here are simple; they are easily and quickly implemented by a skilled programmer. Should there be interest, we would be happy to help others develop the code and test them against ours. We also realize that there is ample room for code optimization. Some of the things that we have considered are pre-calculating sums of terms to convert computation of the correlation coefficient from a sum over N terms to the difference of two sums. Another way to speed the code would be to use hierarchical step sizes in a binary search to find the value of lnN that gives the best straight line.</p>
<p>Our study involving as it did a small group working in different time zones and under extreme time pressure revealed that scientific computation nowadays faces a Babel of computer languages. In some ways this is good as we generally re-coded things rather than struggle with the favorite language of others. Still, we worry about the future of science when so many different tools are used. In this work we used Python for data wrangling and some plotting, Perl and Unix shell tools for data manipulation, Mortran (effectively C++) for the main calculations, xmgrace and gnuplot for other plotting, Excel (and Openoffice) for playing with data. And this diversity is for a group of three!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr, there is no code. I’ve asked Michael Levitt repeatedly for the code to reproduce the figures in his paper and have not received it. I can’t reproduce his plots.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mlevitt_np2013/status/1254853253457539072?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Levitt now lies when confronted about his misguided and wrong prediction about COVID-19 in Israel</a>. He claims it is a “red herring”, and that he was talking about “excess deaths”. I guess he figures he can hide behind Hebrew. <a href="https://twitter.com/NuritBaytch/status/1256734540015587329?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There is a recording</a> where anyone can hear him being asked directly if he is saying he will be surprised with more than 10 COVID-19 deaths in Israel, and his answers is very clear: “I will be very surprised”. It is profoundly demoralizing to discover that a person you respected is a liar, a demagogue or worse. Sadly, <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this has happened to me before</a>.</p>
<p>Levitt continues to put people’s lives at risk by spewing lethal nonsense. He is suggesting that we should let COVID-19 spread in the population so it will mutate to be less harmful. <a href="https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1307795936924577792?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is nonsense</a>. He is promoting anti-vax conspiracy theories <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1307634991325753344?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that are nonsense</a>. He is promoting <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1305791799492071425?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nonsense conspiracy theories about scientists</a>. And yet, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122618622/nobel-prize-winner-weighs-in-on-nzs-covid-strategy-from-a-poolside-in-portugal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he continues to have a prominent voice</a>. It’s not hard to see why. The article, similar to all the others where he is interviewed, begins with “Nobel Prize winner…”</p>


<p>In the Talmud, in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9, it is written “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world”. I thought of this when listening to an <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/nobel-laureate-michael-levitt-on-the-lockdowns-i-think-it-is-a-huge-mistake/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">interview with Michael Levitt</a> that took place in May, where he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I am a real baby-boomer, I was born in 1947, and I think we’ve really screwed up. We cause pollution, we allowed the world’s population to increase three-fold, we’ve caused the problems of global warming, we’ve left your generation with a real mess in order to save a really small number of very old people. If I was a young person now, I would say, “now you guys are gonna pay for this.” </p></blockquote>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>You’ve probably heard of ASMR — or maybe experienced it yourself from watching videos of people doing things like whispering or rustling paper.</strong> But although such videos are incredibly popular, there have been surprisingly few studies on the phenomenon. <a href="https://theconversation.com/asmr-what-we-know-so-far-about-this-unique-brain-phenomenon-and-what-we-dont-135106">Giulia Poerio explores</a> what the research has revealed so far at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<p><span id="more-40336"></span></p>


<p><strong>The feelings of “dissociation” caused by drugs like ketamine seem to be related to slow, rhythmic firing patterns of brain cells in an area called the retrosplenial cortex. </strong>Researchers identified this link first in rodents, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/16/913565163/scientists-discover-way-to-induce-altered-state-of-mind-without-drugs">reports Jon Hamilton</a> at <em>NPR</em>, but then found that similar patterns were seen in a patient with epilepsy when they experienced dissociation.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you were to play your favourite song right now, I imagine you’d have little difficulty clapping along with the beat. Our appreciation of beat allows us to clap, dance, march and sway in time with a piece of music — or just with each other. As the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-63318-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General </em>point out, these behaviours occur spontaneously across human cultures. But while moving to a beat seems effortless, it involves all kinds of perceptual processes.</p>



<p>The team, led by Jessica E. Nave-Blodgett at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, now report that our ability to perceive beat becomes ever more refined and also nuanced through childhood and adolescence. It may seem like an instinctive ability, but it is learned — and training does make it better.</p>


<p><span id="more-40328"></span></p>


<p>The researchers set out to explore our perceptions of both a primary beat (think of a regular metronome) and also what’s known in music as “<a href="https://www.libertyparkmusic.com/musical-time-signatures/">meter</a>“. Meter refers to more complex patterns of beats within a piece. If you’ve ever studied music and seen <strong>4/4</strong>, for example, noted at the start of a piece, this indicates that all the notes in the measure, or bar, add up to four quarter notes. Imagine, then, a beat pattern of <strong>1</strong>, 2 3, 4; <strong>1</strong>, 2, 3, 4. The organisation of beats into regular measures like this represents another level of musical structure. </p>



<p>“Perceiving meter, by definition, entails grasping multiple hierarchical levels of beat simultaneously,” the researchers note, adding: “Like beat, meter is a musical universal and it is critical for coordinating complex patterns of music across multiple individuals….A major question is when perceptual sensitivity to both beat and meter emerge during development.”</p>



<p>To try to answer this question, the team ran studies on children of varying ages and also adults who either had or had not been musically trained.</p>



<p>For the first study, they recruited 32 adults with little or no musical training and 28 musicians. Through one ear, each participant was played a series of brief excerpts of ballroom dance music. These pieces had either a 3/4 or 4/4 meter. In the other ear, they heard a low-pitched metronome. This metronome either matched or mismatched the primary beat and also played a higher-pitched click that matched or mismatched the meter (i.e. by falling on the first beat of each bar, or not). The team were able, then, to create four conditions, in which the metronome matched the music at the level of the beat or the measure or both or neither. Each time, the participants had to indicate, using a four-point scale, “how well” the click track matched the music, from “not well at all” to “very well”.</p>



<p>All the adults were sensitive to both the beat and the meter of the music, and used both to make their matching judgements. They could, then, perceive beat- and measure-level information simultaneously in the music and metronomes. The musicians in the study were slightly better at this, but the non-musicians could still do it.</p>



<p>The team then ran a very similar study on 154 children aged between 5 and 17. (The instructions were made more child-friendly for the younger ages, but the children aged 11-plus performed the task exactly as the adults had.)</p>



<p>Even the youngest children could perceive the primary beat to some degree — all the children rated beat-matching metronomes as better fitting than beat-mismatching metronomes (kids with musical training were particularly good at this). But with age, the difference in ratings for matching vs mismatched metronomes increased. As the researchers write, this suggests that sensitivity to beat-level information develops with age. (Slowly developing beat perception might explain why young kids move so erratically — if cutely — to their favourite songs.) However, the meter-level data was much more inconsistent. “It is likely that meter perception emerges gradually in late adolescence,” the team concludes, only reaching full maturity in adulthood.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study in which beat-level information was removed, 5 to 8-year-olds still couldn’t perceive any measure-level information, while 9 to 13 year-olds could. So this ability is clearly developing around this age — but it’s not yet good enough for them to use it reliably to perceive meter in complex music.</p>



<p>What might account for this pattern of development of beat and meter-level perception? It might relate to age-related improvements in cognitive skills and abilities such as language learning and working memory. But exposure to music no doubt makes a difference, too: adults are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429809/">much better at synchronising their movements to culturally familiar</a> than unfamiliar music, suggesting that they are better at perceiving familiar beat hierarchies.</p>



<p>Some groups of people have more trouble than others at moving to a beat, including children with dyslexia. As the researchers note, there is growing body of work linking problems with rhythm processing to language-related difficulties. Both the type of complex music used in this study and natural language have multiple levels of beat. This experimental set-up might then be useful for exploring just how particular problems with beat and meter perception may relate to <a href="https://www.acamh.org/blog/dyslexia-developmental-language-disorder-different/">difficulties reading or with grammar in spoken language</a>, as well as for further exploring the development of beat perception in all of us.</p>



<p>–  <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-63318-001">Hierarchical beat perception develops throughout childhood and adolescence and is enhanced in those with musical training</a></p>

<p>Watching a Virtual Reality video was found to be an effective decision-making aid for people making an advance care plan. Advance care planning offers people the opportunity to plan their future care and support, including medical treatment, while they have the capacity to do so. Legislation allowing advance care planning is relatively new in Asia and has been recently introduced in Taiwan. Taiwanese people must complete a consultation before formally documenting their wishes. However, health and legal literacy can be a barrier to people making fully-informed decisions about their future care. Wan-Ting Hsieh showed 120 people a short video in virtual reality that documented typical scenarios in end-of-life care, such as hospice home care and the withdrawal of life support. After viewing the video, participant’s preferences for not accessing the medical treatments shown and the ability to make a decision about their future care increased. The study provides evidence for how VR tools could be further rolled out as decision-making aids and bridge gaps in health and legal literacy for important decisions about their future.</p>

Sedentary behavior is an important risk factor for mortality and continues to be a public health challenge with significant health, social and economic consequences. López-Valenciano <em>et al. </em>analyzed data that surveyed European Union adult citizen’s physical activity and sedentary behaviors. In 2002, half of those surveyed were inactive for more than 4.5 hours each day; by 2017 this had risen to 54.5%. The researchers suggested a number of factors could account for this increase in sedentary behavior, such as longer commutes and labor-saving devices at home and work. The authors also attributed people’s interaction with technology such as smartphones and streaming services with increasing physical inactivity. The study provides supporting data for strengthening public health policies and international efforts to tackle rises in sedentary behavior.</p>

Polar bears rapidly evolved several traits from its closest living relative, the brown bear, that has promoted the species’ survival in arctic environments. Castruita <em>et al. </em>studied the genomic mechanisms underpinning how these characteristics were selected in polar bears by analyzing the genomes of more than 100 polar bears and 33 brown bears. The analysis revealed that a combination of standing variation in ancestral gene pools and <em>de novo </em>mutations in polar bear lineages may have promoted the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments. The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the genomic mechanisms behind how polar bears rapidly adapted to the Arctic.</p>

In an effort to flatten peaks of COVID-19 infections, governments have introduced various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, lockdowns, and the use of face-coverings. However, how much of a positive impact these interventions have relies on community understanding, engagement, and compliance. Seale <em>et al. </em>conducted a rapid review of the literature to study the factors that impact community engagement with government interventions. The emerging theme identified by the review was how can an environment be created that supports and promotes the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the community? The authors suggest integrating community co-design of supporting communications and materials to promote engagement and compliance with interventions.</p>

Registering a systematic review protocol promotes transparency, prevents bias, and duplication of work. Cochrane and other bodies recommend prospectively registering systematic review protocols but journals do not mandate it, contrasting with their registration requirements for clinical trials. Tawfik <em>et al. </em>surveyed 270 systematic review and meta-analysis authors to assess researchers’ knowledge and attitudes towards systematic review protocol registration. Survey respondents acknowledged a lack of knowledge surrounding obligation and importance about protocol registration. The study calls for collaborative efforts to raise awareness of the benefits of systematic review protocol registration in the research community.</p>

<p>The NHS Health Check (NHSHC), introduced in the English National Health Service (NHS) in 2009, is a national prevention program offered to adults 40-74 years old with the aim of helping them reduce their chance of having a heart attack or stroke through behavior change and, where appropriate, clinical treatment. Since then, national evaluations have highlighted the need to maximize the program’s impact by improving coverage and outputs. To address these challenges, it is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway and encourage the promotion or minimization of behavioral facilitators and barriers respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>To date research has tended to focus on single populations, e.g. patients or GPs, and specific behaviors, e.g. attending an NHS Health Check. A synthesis of these studies would provide an overarching behavioral picture of those involved in delivery and receipt of NHS Health Checks and so provide the foundations for intervention refinement and development. Our goal was to apply behavioral science frameworks to: i) identify behaviors and actors relevant to uptake, delivery and follow up of NHS Health Checks and influences on these behaviors and ii) signpost to example intervention content.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>We identified 37 studies reporting nine behaviors and influences for eight of these. The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity. Other key influences were motivational, such as beliefs about consequences about the value of NHS Health Checks and behavior change, and social, such as influences of others on behavior change. The following techniques are suggested for websites or smartphone apps: Adding objects to the environment, e.g. provide HCPs with electronic schedules to guide timely delivery of Health Checks to target physical opportunity, Social support (unspecified), e.g. include text suggesting patients to ask a colleague to agree in advance to join them in taking the ‘healthy option’ lunch at work; Information about health consequences, e.g. quotes and/or videos from patients talking about the health benefits of changes they have made.</p>
<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that the recommendations flowing from our findings reflect the types of interventions that we would expect on theoretical grounds to be effective, and this is not a review of effectiveness of interventions. Additional work needs to be done to investigate the extent to which interventions to promote NHS Health Check behaviors target the barriers and facilitators identified in this review. This work would identify any missed opportunities for intervention and inform intervention design and refinement.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations for commissioners and providers, which should be considered as part of the forthcoming NHS Health Check review in order to ensure the program is implemented as effectively as possible for the next 10 years and beyond.<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Imagine that you’re an official faced with an unenviable decision: you must choose whether to establish a farm on existing land which can produce enough to feed 100 hungry families, or cut down an acre of rainforest to create a larger farm able to feed 500 hungry families. What choice would you make?</p>



<p>If you chose <em>not </em>to cut down the rainforest, you’re in the majority. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620948821">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, participants tended to avoid choosing to harm the rainforest, despite the benefits it would bring. This isn’t surprising: time and again, researchers have found that we will <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/28/a-shocking-result-people-are-more-willing-to-hurt-themselves-than-others-for-profit/">avoid causing harm</a> if possible.</p>



<p>Now imagine that your choice is made harder. There’s no free land left; you <em>have </em>to cut down some of the rainforest. Would you cut down one acre to feed 100 families, or two acres to feed 500?</p>



<p>It’s an interesting question, because although researchers believe we’re generally averse to causing harm, they hadn’t really studied how we make decisions when some amount of harm is unavoidable.  And, perhaps surprisingly, in this second scenario almost 80% of people chose to do <em>more</em> damage, cutting down two acres of forest rather than one. In fact, across five other studies as well, Jonathan Berma from London Business School and Daniella Kupor from Boston University find that in situations where harm is unavoidable, people consistently try to maximise the social benefit, rather than minimise the amount of harm caused.</p>


<p><span id="more-40314"></span></p>


<p>Most of the studies followed the same method as the rainforest one: participants either saw a scenario in which harm was avoidable but choosing to cause harm produced greater social benefit, or one in which it was unavoidable and choosing to do<em> more </em>harm produced greater social benefit.</p>



<p>For instance, in one experiment participants imagined they were a doctor deciding whether to pull a dying child off life-support to save money for cancer research. In the “avoidable” condition, they could either choose to do nothing, or to pull life support from a single child to save $60,000. In the “unavoidable” condition, they could pull life support from a single child to save $800, or from two children to save $50,000. Only 29% chose to pull life support in the avoidable condition, but 70% pulled both children off life support in the unavoidable scenario.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that in the experiments the benefit of committing harm was similar in both the “avoidable” and “unavoidable” conditions. Consider the rainforest dilemma: in both cases, adding an extra one acre of destruction (from 0 to 1 acre in the first scenario or from 1 to 2 acres in the second) would help feed 400 more families. So if the gains associated with doing the most harm are similar in each scenario, why are people’s decisions so different?</p>



<p>To examine this further, the researchers explicitly asked participants how much they made their decisions based on a desire to do as little harm as possible versus a desire to ensure that the harm they inflicted provided sufficient benefits. They found that in the scenario where harm was avoidable, participants’ decisions were guided more by a desire to reduce harm — but this flipped in the unavoidable condition, in which decision-making was guided more by a desire to maximise the benefits of doing harm. “Thus, value trade-offs that decision-makers refuse to accept when it is possible to completely avoid committing harm can suddenly become desirable when some harm must be committed,” the authors write.</p>



<p>A final study found that even “protected values” — those that people consider absolute and unchangeable — can be overridden in situations where harm is unavoidable. People who believed that it was unacceptable to cut down tropical rainforest “no matter how great the benefits” tended to avoid destroying an acre of rainforest to build five water treatment facilities when the alternative was to build a single facility without harming the forest. But when it was a choice between destroying one acre for one facility versus two acres for five facilities, even this group went for the more damaging but more socially beneficial option.</p>



<p>Overall then, the paper suggests that we’re less harm-averse than previous studies have implied, at least when it comes to decisions where there is no possibility of avoiding harm altogether. Why does this matter? Well, the authors write, we are constantly faced with decisions that force us to choose between options that have harms as well as benefits. You want some ice cream but there’s no shop in walking distance: should you drive to the nearest supermarket, keeping your carbon emissions to a minimum? Or, as you have to drive anyway, why not go an extra couple of miles to that fancy supermarket with the really nice ice cream, increasing the amount of harm you are doing to the environment, but also maximising the benefits? The study suggests the latter decision might be more likely — so it will be interesting to see whether the findings do hold up for these kinds of real life decisions too.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/GycEZabM7cM/">Transparency and Trust: Peer Review Week 2020</a></h4>

<p><em>This post is written by PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer Veronique Kiermer</em></p>



<p>Peer Review Week is a time to celebrate the outstanding work of reviewers across the scholarly ecosystem. But it also serves as a call to action to examine the systems we have in place and opportunities to improve. </p>



<p>This peer review week, the theme couldn’t feel more timely. Trust in science, and peer review more specifically has taken the spotlight as doctors, researchers, and policymakers around the world collaborate to rapidly expand and communicate emerging knowledge about COVID-19. </p>



<p>At the same time, the advent of preprints in biomedical sciences has created <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux">new challenges</a> to evaluate findings outside the traditional framework of journal peer review, and high profile journal retractions have contributed to raise doubts about the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/">pre-publication peer review</a>. With the flood of information pouring in, public readers and researchers alike face the same question: how do I identify information I can trust? </p>



<p><strong>Does Peer Review Work?</strong></p>



<p>Peer review has long been a staple of the credibility of scientific findings for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206">researchers </a>and for <a href="https://pewrsr.ch/2Hgq31S">the public</a>.  The process embodies the norm of organized skepticism that helps generate trust in scientific findings—by testing the rigor of thinking and experimentation, and by providing authors with expert feedback to build on. But importantly, peer review is more than the traditional view of pre-publication peer review conducted behind closed doors. Peer review does not stop with publication—in many ways, it only starts there. </p>



<p>Recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen researchers rapidly come together <em>after</em> the publication of high-stake results and point out serious methodological flaws which have led to retractions of articles and withdrawals of preprints. Social media has been an unconventional, yet instrumental tool in coordinated reactions. Some have argued this is a failure of peer review, but we believe it’s actually a celebration of peer review in different forms. </p>



<p><strong>A broader view of peer review</strong></p>



<p>While post-publication peer review remains rare, preprints offer new opportunities to leverage the community in order to address the challenges and limitations of traditional peer review. For example, reviewers and editors commonly acknowledge that it is increasingly difficult to cover all the bases of expertise required to properly analyze articles that have become much more multidisciplinary. Preprint commenting while the article is under review is one possible solution <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/">we’ve encouraged</a> to address this gap, by opening up the opportunity for any researcher, anywhere in the world to volunteer their expertise, for consideration by the editor. While commenting on preprints is still rare, it could allow journals to channel within the traditional process the energy that the community already puts in scrutinizing new findings within their specialty before they are formally published in journals. </p>



<p>Preprints and preprint commenting can also help with another challenge of journal review: speed. PLOS journals offer authors the option to post preprints on their behalf at submission—after minimal checks for any content with potential to cause harm—so their findings can be disseminated while the journal curation process takes place.  We also participate in initiatives like Review Commons to provide journal-agnostic reviews that can <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/">accelerate the peer review process</a> at the author’s destination journal and alleviate the strain of repeated reviews on the peer reviewer community.</p>



<p>Beyond these practical issues, we must consider systemic challenges and in particular the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/400515v1">documented biases</a> in peer review. At PLOS we acknowledge the need to improve the diversity of our reviewer pool to help mitigate such biases and we are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">committed to this work</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Transparency, transparency, transparency </strong></p>



<p>An important prerequisite for all peer review mechanisms to work as effectively as they can is transparency. </p>



<p>Transparency facilitates trust. Working to make every step of the research and publication process as Open as possible gives journals, peer reviewers, and the scholarly community more broadly, the means for scrutiny, and a clear understanding of limitations. At the same time, it gives readers deeper insight into the scientific process and the various checkpoints that uphold it. </p>



<p>From an author’s perspective, increasing transparency means making all relevant data, code, methodologies, and reagents available so that the scholarly community—starting with reviewers—can validate and reproduce the findings independently. A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/kabux/">recent survey</a> by the Center for Open Science indicated that researchers judging preprint credibility were influenced by cues related to open data, code and other openness measures, as well as independent verification of authors claims. </p>



<p>Publishing peer review reports as well is important as it makes evident what aspects of the article were (and were not) thoroughly scrutinized pre-publication. All PLOS journals now encourage their authors to publish their peer review history alongside the article, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/">uptake is promising</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Peer review needs better recognition </strong></p>



<p>Transparency in peer review is also crucial to recognizing peer review as a first-rate academic output. It is time for this activity, essential to the scientific process, to be considered a scientific output in its own right and to take its due place in the context of research and researchers assessment. With published peer review reports, individual reviewers can choose to take credit by revealing their identity. But recognizing that there are circumstances that call for anonymity, even unnamed reviewers should have this opportunity, and tools like ORCID and Publons allow them to demonstrate their contributions as part of their academic profile. </p>



<p>There’s always more we can do to provide the motivation and support for reviewers’ work. Peer review transparency and other visual signs of recognition are a way to start helping researchers leverage their  peer review expertise to advance their careers. </p>



<p><strong>Earning trust in peer review</strong></p>



<p>Despite its challenges, the traditional journal peer review process offers important opportunities to ensure fairness in peer review. And journals have a collective responsibility to make use of these opportunities. First and foremost, we can ensure that every paper reporting a rigorously designed and executed study is peer reviewed—not only the high-stakes findings and the work of well known authors. We can also take proactive measures to limit bias, such as increasing the diversity of reviewer pools, and managing competing interests. We can foster consistent review criteria, and supplement the volunteer peer review reports with additional scrutiny for elements like statistics or ethical research practices. </p>



<p>In sum, I believe there are complementary benefits of journal-organized peer review and the process that can take place more organically in the research community post-publication—whether the publication is in a journal or on a preprint server. With more transparency in the system, we can take advantage of all mechanisms of peer review to decide what to trust, and importantly peer review itself can deserve our trust. </p>

In both pathways, the inhibition of movement is thought to be traceable back to excitatory <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/glutamate" target="_blank">glutamate </a>neurons that extend from the subthalamic nucleus to stimulate <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba" target="_blank">GABA</a> neurons in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>; these GABA neurons in turn exert an inhibitory influence over neurons in the thalamus that typically prompt movement when they’re excited. </p><p class="">Watch this video to learn more about the indirect pathway, a circuit in the basal ganglia that includes the subthalamic nucleus and is thought to play an important role in the inhibition of movement.</p><p class="">The subthalamic nucleus’ role in suppressing unwanted movements may be critical even for the simplest movements. If, for example, you are reaching out to pick up a cup of coffee, your brain must not only activate the muscles necessary for the movement, but inhibit those that would counteract the desired movement. Indeed, even when you are sitting still, unwanted movements (like your hand jerking involuntarily up in the air) must continuously be subdued by your brain. It has been hypothesized that the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in these types of movement inhibition.</p><p class="">It’s important to note, however, that the functions of the subthalamic nucleus (and basal ganglia as a whole) are not limited to movement. Recent research suggests the subthalamic nucleus may also contribute to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/" target="_blank">cognitive functions like decision-making, attention, and working memory</a> (among others). And the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/" target="_blank">subthalamic nucleus may be part of circuits that have important influences on emotion</a> as well. </p><p class="">Some of our understanding of these more extensive roles for the subthalamic nucleus come from studies involving <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-brain-stimulation-dbs" target="_blank">deep brain stimulation</a>, or DBS. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting an electrode in the brain. Once the electrode is in place, it can be prompted to emit electrical impulses that are hypothesized to interfere with neural activity.</p><p class="">DBS has been found to be especially useful in the treatment of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by movement problems like slow, effortful movement, and difficulty initiating movements. It is believed that some of these movement-related symptoms stem from overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus. This increased subthalamic nucleus activity may lead to excessive inhibition of movement via the basal ganglia circuits mentioned above. </p><p class="">Thus, when the electrode in DBS is positioned in or near the subthalamic nucleus, turning the device on can disrupt the inhibitory actions of the subthalamic nucleus and facilitate movement. To learn more about DBS, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog//deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease-mechanism" target="_blank">see this article</a>.</p><p class="">As mentioned above, the use of DBS has also helped us to appreciate the complexity of the roles of the subthalamic nucleus. Many patients who receive DBS experience not only an improvement of their Parkinsonian symptoms, but also develop side effects that include cognitive and emotional changes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/" target="_blank">like memory disturbances and apathy</a>. It has been proposed that disruption of the function of the subthalamic nucleus might be responsible for these side effects of DBS. It should be said, however, that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/" target="_blank">variability in the side effects of DBS</a>—as well as a poor understanding of exactly how DBS affects brain activity—makes it difficult to say this with certainty.</p><p class="">Regardless, the evidence collected to date suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is an important area of the brain for motor control and a variety of other actions. Future research will be needed, however, to fully understand the functions of this small—but important—collection of neurons.<br /></p><h3><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></h3><p class="">Bonnevie T, Zaghloul KA.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>As everyone knows, American undergrads are not representative of all humanity — and the perils of drawing conclusions about people in general from <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird">WEIRD studies</a> have been well-publicised. To really understand which human experiences are universal, and which are a product of our individual cultures, we need big, well-conducted studies of people from many different cultures. Fortunately, there are studies like this. Here are some of their most fascinating insights…</p>


<p><span id="more-40304"></span></p>


<p><strong>Personal space</strong></p>



<p>How big is your “personal space”? As a Brit, I’d expect mine to be larger than that of the average Italian’s, say. That’s because I know there are studies finding that people living in cultures that favour physical contact tend to have smaller “personal bubbles”. However, until recently, decent cross-cultural analyses of this concept had been lacking. </p>



<p>That changed with a 2017 paper on “Preferred interpersonal distances” in the <a href="https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/873645.sorokowska_et_al_2017.pdf"><em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em></a> from authors representing a total of 59 institutions, based everywhere from Beijing to Uruguay to Iran. In total, the team, led by Agnieszka Sorokowska, collected data on almost 9000 participants from 42 countries. They looked at preferences for “social distance” (physical distance when interacting with a stranger), “personal distance” (when with an acquaintance), and “intimate distance” (when interacting with a family member, for example). </p>



<p>There were positive correlations between all three measures, but especially between the first two: people who preferred to stand closer to a stranger also tended to like being closer to an acquaintance. And when it came to country-by-country variations, the team found some big differences. People in Argentina had the smallest bubbles: they were happy for acquaintances to get within about 60 cm, and allowed close friends and family about another 15 cm nearer. England and the US fell about a third of the way up the acceptable distance chart — people in England preferred acquaintances to stay about 20 cm further away than Argentinians did, for example. The list was topped, though, by Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The average Hungarian’s preferred personal distance was almost <em>twice</em> that of the average Argentinian’s.</p>



<p>Exactly what might drive these country differences isn’t clear. But the team did note that, on the whole, women, older people and residents of colder countries preferred to keep strangers further at bay. Right now, however, Covid-19 means that of course we’re all used to more personal space than normal. But fear of the virus, along with long, stressful periods in lockdown, have led to a doubling in the personal distances perceived as comfortable among people in Lombardy, the region of Italy most affected by the virus, according to Tina Iachini at the University of Campania. “Social distance is like an invisible buffer around us that we always carry,” <a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-05-03/COVID-19-means-we-all-want-more-personal-space-Q9hylaKKcg/index.html">she’s been quoted as saying</a>. “It is our shield of safety and that is why we are so sensitive to the safety value of this space.”</p>



<p><strong>Emotion terms  </strong></p>



<p>What does “anger” or “happiness” mean to you? And do these, and other emotion labels, mean essentially the same thing to an English-speaker as their nearest translations do to people who speak other languages? </p>



<p>Earlier this year, a team led by Joshua Conrad Jackson at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">paper in <em>Science</em></a> that looked for variations in the meaning of 24 emotional concepts across 2474 languages. The team examined the pattern of “colexification” in the different languages: that is, the way that single words are used to describe multiple concepts. For instance, in Persian, <em>ænduh</em> means both grief and regret, while in the Dargwa dialect, spoken in Dagestan in Russia, <em>dard</em> means grief and anxiety. So speakers of the two languages might have slightly different understandings of what “grief” is.</p>



<p>The team found important variations between language families. For example, in some languages, “anger” was related to “envy”, whereas in others it was linked more with “hate” or “proud”. In some Austronesian languages, “pity” and “love” were associated, whereas in others, they were not. (In general, though, there was agreement about which emotions are “positive” and which are “negative”.) The work suggests that there are indeed shades of culturally-influenced emotional experience. </p>



<p><strong>Sensory perceptions</strong></p>



<p>The octave system is not only intrinsic to Western music, it’s also mathematically-based: move up an octave, and a given note doubles in frequency. Perhaps, then, Western music has come to use this system because it relates to the way that sound waves physically stimulate the cochlea in our inner ear — in other words, there’s something biologically fundamental, and universal, about the way we perceive pitch. </p>



<p>The problem with this suggestion is that, until recently, researchers hadn’t tested the musical perceptions of people who had not been exposed to Western music. In 2019, that changed. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096098221931036X">paper in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, a team led by Nori Jacoby at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics revealed that a remote group of people living in the Bolivian rainforest don’t process pitch in the same way as Americans. Unlike those of us used to listening to Western music, these people don’t perceive similarities between two notes occurring an octave apart. </p>



<p>This work adds to other research, notably in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/18335">vision</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/13/studies-of-se-asian-tribes-force-a-re-think-on-the-psychology-of-language-and-smell/">smell</a>, revealing that, while of course we humans all possess the same hardware, culture influences our sensory perceptions. </p>



<p><strong>Mate preferences</strong></p>



<p>Back in 1989, the American psychologist David Buss published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889">an influential paper</a> concluding that there are some clear gender differences in mate preferences. Based on a study of data from more than 10,000 participants from 37 different cultures, he and his team suggested that women tend to be more interested in “good financial prospects” than men, and that men, more than women, consider “good looks” to be important in a mate. Cue a heated debate, and all kinds of follow-up studies. The big question was this: if these differences indeed exist, are they driven by biology, or by culture — and specifically by gender inequality? In cultures with markedly greater gender equality, might these differences disappear? </p>



<p>In 2020, against a backdrop of old data and conflicting methods and conclusions, a huge international team, led by Kathryn Walter at the University of California, Santa Barbara, published a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620904154?journalCode=pssa">large-scale replication study</a> on more than 14,000 participants across 45 countries. Across groups, men were more interested in physical attractiveness than women, who in turn preferred older mates with good financial prospects. In countries with greater gender equality, couples tended to be more closely matched in age, but beyond this, levels of gender equality did not have an impact. The researchers concluded: “Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust.”</p>



<p><strong>Human values </strong></p>



<p>Do we all fundamentally value the same things? And do these values vary at all with age — or between genders? </p>



<p>These are more than theoretically important questions. As the team behind a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recent paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> led by Paul Hanel (Cardiff University) note, immigration is triggering some conflicts over perceptions of value. For example, a 2016 poll reported that three quarters of people living in Ontario, Canada, felt that <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/07/04/ontario-facing-epidemic-of-islamophobia-survey-finds.html">Muslim immigrants have fundamentally different values to their own</a>. </p>



<p>However, other surveys have found that people around the world agree on values. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022101032003002">one study</a> by Shalom Schwartz and Anat Bardi, people from 50 different countries tended to agree that benevolence, universalism and self-direction are highly important; tradition and power were valued least. </p>



<p>So what can explain these discrepancies? Hanel and his colleagues <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recently studied</a> people living in three different cultures: Brazil, India and the UK. They concluded that people in different nations can differ in the behaviours associated with certain values, while still holding similar ideas about the meaning and importance of those values. </p>



<p>In 2020, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-16473-001">separate team led by Roosevelt Vilar</a> looked at age and gender differences in values among more than 20,000 people living across 20 countries with “substantial” cultural variability. They found slight differences between men and women through most life stages. In general, women were more focused on social and ‘central’ goals (helping others, for example) whereas men were more focused on personal goals (excitement and promotion). Older people, too, valued social and central goals more than younger people, who were more enamoured of personal goals. </p>



<p>However, the team reports, culture had virtually no impact on the results. This, they argue, “supports the lifespan developmental psychological idea that values reflect a universal pattern of human agency in facing challenges over the life span”.</p>



<p>Broadly, then, this study, at least, argues that we are all driven to have fundamentally the same values — and the same slightly diverging values, according to age and gender — no matter where we live in the world.</p>



<p>While all these studies help us to understand which aspects of the human experience are universal, they don’t actually fix the WEIRD problem, of course. What we really need are for researchers to include non-WEIRD participants in studies as <em>standard</em>. But while this should make results more generalisable, clearly there could also be situations in which there <em>are</em> meaningful differences in results between cultures — and these should be appreciated, too.</p>

<p>To record the activity from a  population of neurons, calcium imaging and extracellular recordings with small electrodes are the two most widely used methods that are still  able to disentangle the contributions from single units. Here, I would like to briefly mention two papers that try to connect these two approaches by comparing them more or less directly.</p>



<ol><li>Wei et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1">A comparison of neuronal population dynamics measured with calcium imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2019<br />[<strong>Update, 2020-09-15</strong>: The paper just came out in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198">PLoS Comp Biology</a> just one day after the blog post!]<br /></li><li>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244723v1">Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with two-photon imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2020<br /></li></ol>



<p>Both papers compare calcium imaging datasets and extracellular ephys datasets, try to connect the results and point out the difficulties in reconciling the approaches.</p>



<p><strong>Wei et al. </strong>use datasets recorded in mouse anterio-lateral motor cortex (ALM). They first focus on approaches to reconstruct spike rates from calcium imaging data (deconvolution) and find several limitations of this approach. On the other hand, they find that a forward model that transforms spiking activity to calcium fluorescence data can reconcile most of these differences.</p>



<p>The authors also provide a user-friendly website which can be used to explore the transformations between ephys and imaging data (also including datasets with simultaneous ephys-imaging): <a href="http://im-phys.org">http://im-phys.org</a>. (Understanding the figures of the paper is however quite useful before exploring the website.)</p>

<p>A large part of the paper focuses on high-level analyses (principal component analysis, decoding of behavior and decision). I would take it as an educational tale of caution which highlights wrong conclusions that could be made based on standard analyses. For example, the slow and variable decay times of calcium imaging data can lead to a dispersion of peak activity that was absent in the ephys data. This dispersion can smear out clearly timed activations of neuronal population into something more similar to a sequence (see Figure 7, of which I have pasted an excerpt above).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</strong> from the Allen Institute, rather than investigating the effects on higher-level population analyses, focus their attention on the effects seen in single neurons. When comparing a calcium imaging and an ephys dataset recorded in the same brain region (visual cortex V1) in mice that do the same standardized tasks, what differences can be seen in the firing properties of single neurons?</p>



<p>Due to the high standardization requirements at the Allen Institute, their datasets are probably uniquely qualified to be the basis for such a comparison. Interestingly, they find a couple of clear differences. For example, extracellular ephys data suggest typical firing rates of around 3 Hz (see Figure 2A), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than what has been recorded and estimated from calcium imaging data (see also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Figure 7 in our preprint</a>, which estimates spike rates of the same dataset).</p>



<p>The authors go to great lengths to use forward transformations (similar to Wei et al.) in order to reconcile differences seen for various response metrics (responsiveness, tuning preference, selectivity). However, their conclusion seemed to me quite a bit less optimistic compared to the Wei et al. paper. The authors go into more detail when discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancies, and focus on the recording methods themselves rather than on methods to transform between them. In particular their analysis of inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations in ephys recordings (which indicate that spikes from different neurons contaminate the recording of the neuron of interest) was, in my opinion, particularly interesting and convincing. I also really recommend to anybody the last paragraph of their discussion, from which I only want to cite their note of caution about extracellular ephys recordings:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From this study, we have learned that extracellular electrophysiology overestimates the fraction of neurons that elevate their activity in response to visual stimuli, in a manner that is consistent with the effects of selection bias and contamination. – Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</p></blockquote>



<p>One of the reasons why I am writing about these two studies is that I have been working at the interface of calcium imaging and ephys myself, addressing the question, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">How much information about spike rates can we get out of calcium imaging data?</a> Wei et al. and Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al. take a slightly broader perspective. And, in some way, they show how hard it is to reconcile two (methodological) perspectives on the same phenomenon. (I noticed this in my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a> as well, when it came to reconciling results from EM reconstructions of neuronal anatomy and calcium measurements of the same neurons.) Since almost any method in systems neuroscience is technically challenging, we often have in a single lab only a single perspective of a phenomenon, and I think it’s important to always be aware that the conclusions drawn from this perspective might be strongly biased.</p>



<p>In general, calcium imaging and extracellular ephys are extremely valuable tools to observe the living brain, and we better do anything to understand the properties and limitations of these tools. These studies sometimes might feel a bit like negative results and therefore not very attractive to those who want to advance neuroscience, and I therefore understand why not many are willing to undertake these projects. So I am glad to be able to highlight these two publications here.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>When Usain Bolt or Serena Williams step out for their latest race or match, the world waits with bated breath. As some of the best athletes in the world, their unbelievable winning streaks have been met by almost universal acclaim — and plenty of people hoping that streak isn’t broken.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-59201-001">according to</a> Jesse Walker from Ohio State University and Thomas Gilovich from Cornell University, that investment and goodwill just isn’t the same when it comes to teams: we’re far less impressed by consecutive wins by groups of people than those by individuals. They call this phenomenon the “Streaking Star Effect” in their new paper in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.  </p>


<p><span id="more-40296"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 207 participants read about the history and rules of Calcio Fiorentino, an obscure amateur Italian sport combining aspects of football, rugby and martial arts. Participants in the “team” condition were told the Milan team were the best in the world, winning six championships in a row; those in the “individual” condition read about Robert Moretti, the best player in the world, on the same streak. They then rated how much they would be rooting for either Milan or Moretti to win the championship and how much they would want the streak to come to an end.</p>



<p>Participants wanted to see Roberto Moretti continue his winning streak significantly more than they wanted the Milan team to do the same. Given that participants were American, they likely were not familiar with either the game or Moretti, suggesting that the results couldn’t be explained by a desire to see a beloved figure succeed. </p>



<p>The same results held in a second study using the similarly obscure example of a British quizzing competition. A third, in which the pool of competitors was exactly the same size for individuals and teams, showed that the Streaking Star Effect couldn’t be explained by the fact individual participants were likely to have beaten more competitors than teams would have.</p>



<p>The fourth study looked more closely at the underlying causes of the Streaking Star Effect. A total of 205 participants read about the National Association of Police Organizations, which gives awards each year to both individual police officers and departments. In the individual condition, participants read about an award given to the best homicide detective in the USA, and were told that Edwin Sorenson had won the award four years in a row. Participants in the group condition read about an award for the best homicide department in the country, learning that either the Kansas City or Los Angeles Police Department had, again, won four years in a row.</p>



<p>As well as answering the questions from the first three studies, participants also indicated how much they would feel awe, amazement and wonder if either Sorenson’s or the police department’s streak were to continue. To distinguish awe from other positive emotions, participants also stated how happy, amused and compassionate they would feel.</p>



<p>Again, participants were significantly more keen to see the individual (Detective Sorenson) extend his winning streak than the team (the police department). Furthermore, participants felt more wonder at the prospect of Detective Sorenson’s continued success and more positive emotion overall, suggesting that feelings of awe can lead to a greater desire to see an individual winning streak continue.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were asked to explain why they felt either an individual or a team was on a winning streak. Success was more often chalked up to disposition or personal characteristics (rather than circumstances) for individuals than it was for teams. Greater dispositional attributions were also linked to increased feelings of awe. In other words, credit was given to an individual and their talents more than their situation, creating far more emotional attachment and investment than for team achievements, which tended to be attributed to circumstances.</p>



<p>A final study confirmed that the Streaking Star Effect holds even outside of sports: when a company’s success was attributed to an individual CEO, participants felt that the company deserved a greater market share than when it had been guided by a group of executives. This makes sense: companies like Microsoft and Apple have famously benefited from charismatic founders and CEOs, while those without a focus on an individual leader often hold less emotional resonance for the general public.</p>



<p>This final study hints at wider repercussions too, and in a follow-up survey the team found participants far less tolerant of wealth inequality when those at the top were described in group rather than individual terms: when <em>individuals</em> were perceived to be at the top, participants were more likely to believe they deserved it. Stretching beyond sport, the Streaking Star Effect may even, as Walker and Gilovich put it, change the way we think about “the rich and poor, the powerful and powerless”.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Tinnitus-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Let’s be honest, when most of us attend or take part in noisy recreational activities (e.g., nightclubs, concerts, playing musical instruments, indoor/outdoor sporting activities, motorsports) the last thing we reach for are hearing protection devices (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs). This is despite the fact that these activities can often range in loudness levels over 100 dBA, with the potential to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html">cause hearing symptoms (e.g., dullness in hearing/tinnitus) after 15 minutes</a> of continuous exposure. This is one of the reasons why the <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/ear-care/en/">World Health Organization</a> estimates that over a billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing symptoms due to recreational noise exposure.</p>
<p>The use of hearing protection devices is recognized as a method of reducing noise exposure. However, the amount of people using these devices within recreational contexts just ‘some of the time’ can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722160/">as low as ~5%</a>, and even fewer people ‘always’ using them. Some people do tend to walk away from loud sources of noise, or go and take a break on a night out (e.g., regeneration break), and this is another method of protecting your hearing.</p>
<p>In order to improve hearing protection behaviors (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs, regeneration breaks) through interventions it would be beneficial to know how effective previous interventions have been in recreational contexts, and what were the active ingredients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327617/">behavior change techniques</a> (BCTs)) of these interventions trying to bring about the change.  Knowing what BCTs have been applied previously, or perhaps not, can help future designers of hearing protection interventions to potentially improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review of any intervention studies that measured a deliberate attempt to increase hearing protection behaviors during noisy recreational activities.</p>
<p>So what did we find? We found eight studies measuring behavior post-intervention, of which only three were experimental post-test designs (two randomized controlled studies and one quasi). The most common behavior reported was the use of earplugs, seen in all eight studies, with five having a small to medium effect (d ≥ 0·3 ≤ 0·5) at measuring an increase, or difference in earplug use – including all three experimental studies. The overall increase or difference in earplugs being used ‘some of the time’ across all eight studies ranged from 3% -14.6%, but with very few ‘always’ using earplugs people are at risk of acquiring hearing symptoms.</p>
<p>In terms of BCTs, across all studies we found a total of 17 different techniques had been deployed out of a possible 93 available from within the ‘<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23512568/">behavior change technique taxonomy version 1</a>’, with the majority serving an intervention category of ‘education’ (e.g., information about health consequences). With so few BCTs coded it leaves a large scope to test previously unused techniques. However, all three experimental studies restructured the environment by providing free earplugs (e.g., adding objects to the environment), and each measured a small to medium effect for at least one recreational context – perhaps indicating that this should be at least considered for future interventions.</p>
<p>Overall the results tell us there are very few hearing protection interventions addressing recreational noise exposure, a global hearing health concern, and those that have tackled the issue have had mixed success. Further intervention studies should be conducted that employ randomized controlled designs, with use of systematic approaches to intervention development (e.g. <a href="https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-6-42">the behavior change wheel</a>), as this will help target specific behavior change techniques in an effort to increase hearing protection behaviors and raise effect sizes.</p>
<p>Will you be reaching for your earplugs the next time?</p>

Over 41 million people have watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpccpglnNf0" target="_blank">Goats Yelling Like Humans - Super Cut Compilation</a> on YouTube. We all know that goats have complex vocalizations, but very few of us know what they mean.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For the health and well-being of livestock, it's <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2019.00024/full" target="_blank" title="greater understanding of Farm Animal Cognition is also important">advantageous to understand</a> the emotional states conveyed by vocalizations, postures, and other behaviors. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126" target="_blank" title="Emotions in goats: mapping physiological, behavioural and vocal profiles">2015 study</a> measured the acoustic features of different goat calls, along with their associated behavioral and physiological responses. Twenty-two adult goats were put in four situations: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">(1) control (neutral)<br />(2) anticipation of a food reward (positive)<br />(3) food-related frustration (negative)<br />(4) social isolation (negative)</blockquote>Dr. Elodie Briefer and colleagues conducted the study at a goat sanctuary in Kent, UK (<a href="http://www.buttercups.org.uk/" target="_blank">Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats</a>). The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days. Additional details are presented in the first footnote.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span><br /><br /><br /><audio controls=""><source src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0003347214004126-mmc1.mp3?attredirects=0&amp;d=1" /></audio><br /><br /><br /><span><b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#dfig1" title="Audio A1">Audio A1</a>.</b> One call produced during a negative situation (food frustration), followed  by a call produced during a positive situation (food reward) by the same goat (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126" target="_blank">Briefer et al., 2015)</a>.</span><br /><br /><br />Behavioral responses during the scenarios were timed and scored; these included tail position, locomotion, rapid head movement, ear orientation, and number of calls.

I think I would need a lot more training to identify the range of goat emotions conveyed in my amateur video.

In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure. For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45">Teufel et al. 2007</a>; <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43" id="__tag_746041107">Siniscalchi et al. 2008</a>).  <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.</b></span> There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ...

Three examples of each vocalization were played, each from a different and unfamiliar goat (or dog).<br /><br />The various theories of brain lateralization of emotion predicted different results. The <b>right hemisphere model </b>predicts right hemisphere dominance (head turn to the left) for high-arousal emotion regardless of valence (food anticipation, food frustration, dog barks). In contrast, the <b>valence model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for processing negative emotions (food frustration, isolation, dog barks), and left hemisphere dominance for positive emotions (food anticipation). The <b>conspecific model</b> predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a <b>general emotion model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.<br /><br />The results sort of supported the <b>conspecific model</b> (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [<i>if I understand correctly</i>]. The head-orienting response did not differ significantly between the four vocalizations, and there was a slight bias for head orienting to the right (p=.046 vs. chance level), when collapsed across all stimulus types.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />The time to resume feeding after hearing a vocalization (a measure of fear) didn't differ between goat calls and dog barks, so the authors concluded that “goats at our study site may have been habituated to dog barks and that they did not perceive dog barks as a serious threat.” However, if a Siberian Husky breaks free of its owner and runs around a fenced-in rent-a-goat herd, chaos may ensue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> Methodological details:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“(1) During the control situation, goats were left unmanipulated in a pen with hay (‘Control’).

(3) After goats had been tested with the Feeding situation, they were tested with a food frustration situation. This consisted of giving food to only one of the goats in the pair and not to the subject (‘Frustration’).

<p><strong>Some people who have been infected with Covid-19 continue to have physical symptoms for months — and this can take its toll on their mental health. </strong>Recent research has suggested that between one third and one half of Covid “long-haulers” may experience mental health problems like anxiety, depression or fatigue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/health/coronavirus-mental-health-long-hauler.html">writes Emma Goldberg</a> at the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>After we lose someone, our feelings of grief don’t follow the fixed timeline of discrete stages often depicted in popular culture. </strong>Instead, the course of grief can be messy and manifest differently for different people, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akz9ee/we-want-grief-to-follow-a-timeline-it-doesnt">writes Shayla Love</a> at <em>Vice</em>. </p>

<p><strong>The use of polygraph machines — also known as lie detectors — is “creeping into UK policing”</strong>, according to a <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-police-polygraph-lie-detector-terrorism">story from Amit Katwala at <em>WIRED</em></a>.  In a recent study, few UK police forces would confirm or deny that they used polygraphs, and some appeared to be using them in “covert” or “investigatory” contexts. Yet a large body of research has shown that polygraphs are not a reliable way of telling whether someone is lying.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/09/10/sexual-harassment-case-number-1052/">Sexual harassment case number 1,052</a></h4>

<p>Despite much ado about the #metoo movement in recent years, the crisis of sexual harassment in academia persists without an end in sight. The <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a> now lists 1,051 cases, each of them a tragedy of trauma, unspeakable violations of victims, and dreams destroyed. I’ve written previously about two cases listed in the database (<a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/yuval-peres/">Yuval Peres</a> and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/terry-speed-a-male-feminist/">Terry Speed</a>). Now, I feel compelled to write about yet another sexual harassment case.</p>



<p><a href="https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/dumitrescu-ph-d-adrian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adrian Dumitrescu</a> is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I have known of his work for many years, as we have a shared interest in extremal combinatorics, having both worked on <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-04/S0273-0979-00-00877-6/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Erdös-Szekeres “Happy Ending Problem”</a>. Last week a Facebook post was brought to my attention, in which a graduate student describes a horrible case of sexual harassment by Prof. Dumitrescu that occurred during a conference in Boston in 2016.</p>



<p>This student filed a Title IX complaint with the University of Wisconsin, and I have a copy of the report. The Office of Equity and Diversity (EDS) that investigated the case found that “Based on the totality of the circumstances, the information obtained pursuant to this investigation, and for all the reasons set forth above, EDS concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding, by preponderance of the evidence, of sexual harassment against the Respondent [Prof. Dumitrescu].” Furthermore, the report states that “based on the seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct, EDS believes that disciplinary action is warranted in this matter, and recommends that the Provost refer this case for imposition of discipline”. As I write this post, Prof. Dumitrescu is still listed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.</p>



<p>Notably, after being sexually harassed by the Respondent, and before filing a report with Title IX, the student consulted her Ph.D. advisor. The report describes his response as follows: “[he] told her that the Respondent had a ‘high reputation’ in the field and it was better to ‘avoid trouble’ and not to report her concerns.” And yet she had the courage to report the case, despite the attempt to silence her, and having being threatened by the Respondent, as he coerced her to sleep with him, that if she did not acquiesce to his demands he would not conduct research with her and he might prevent senior scholars at her university from working with her.</p>



<p>The report details how the sexual harassment impacted the complainant’s research progress and mental well-being. Yet again, a talented young scientist finds herself with debilitating trauma, a career in jeopardy, and powerless in the face of an establishment that excuses harassers.</p>



<p>The details of this case are of course different than every other sexual harassment case. Each is tragic in its own way. And yet elements of what happened here are to be found in all sexual harassment cases. Power imbalance. Coercion. Threats. Silencing of the victim. Inaction. Banal injustice. This will be case number 1,052 in the <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a>.</p>



<p>We must do better.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed all our lives. For those of us fortunate enough to avoid unemployment, our work lives have still changed drastically. So how long should it take employees to recover psychologically, and settle into a “new normal”? According to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-61814-001.html">new paper,</a> published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, this process actually began very early on. This is among the first work to show that psychological recovery can start <em>during</em> a stressful experience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40268"></span></p>


<p>The pandemic has threatened workers’ wellbeing in all kinds of ways. As Eric Anicich at the University of Southern California and his colleagues point out, it has increased personal economic uncertainty (through furloughs and lay-offs and the prospect of more redundancies), constrained our physical movements and forced many of us to suddenly start working from home — as well as of course threatening our health, even our lives. All of these factors have challenged our autonomy, which is important for wellbeing because it entails feeling in control of our own actions, and seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals. (This particular aspect of autonomy is often referred to as “authenticity”).</p>



<p>The researchers set out therefore to explore how the pandemic might affect both feelings of powerlessnesss and authenticity. They focused on workers — specifically on full-time employees of 41 community colleges on the West Coast of the US.</p>



<p>One of the remarkable aspects of the study was its timing. The 117 participants completed background surveys during March 9 – 15, 2020. At this point, they were assessed for the personality trait of neuroticism and also gave demographic data. The main data collection then ran over two consecutive work weeks, starting March 16. It began, then, on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO and a “national emergency” by the US government.</p>



<p>Three times a day — in the morning, early afternoon and late afternoon — during those ten days, the participants used five-point scales to indicate their level of agreement with two statements: “Right now, I feel powerless” and “I feel like I am able to be truly myself right now”. They also rated their “current stress level regarding the COVID-19 situation”. (These surveys were purposefully very brief, in a bid to maintain participation over the fortnight.)</p>



<p>The analysis revealed two trends: over this period, the employees reported feeling <em>decreasingly</em> powerless and <em>more</em> authentic. However, their high stress levels did not change.</p>



<p>The team were able to compare this group’s responses with very similar types of data that they had collected from a different group in September 2019. They found that (unsurprisingly) the COVID-era group started out feeling more powerless and less authentic than the pre-COVID group. But for this 2019 group, there were no clear trends in changes over time for either measure. As the researchers write: “these results provide additional evidence that the temporal trajectories of powerlessness and authenticity observed in our focal dataset are unique to the time period associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.”</p>



<p>Previous studies exploring psychological recovery from a major stressor have tended to begin after the stressor has ended, and noted changes over months or even years. In contrast, this study shows that recovery (in relation to these two measures, at least) can begin almost immediately after the start of an ongoing stressful event. “Interestingly, these effects emerged while neither the objective situation nor the subjective stress reactions to it were improving,” the researchers note.</p>



<p>Also interestingly, those participants who’d scored relatively highly for neuroticism (which entails an increased tendency to feel anxious, depressed and vulnerable) at the start of the study showed the steepest decreases in powerlessness and increases in authenticity. Why? Perhaps, the team suggests, because during difficult times, people who tend to worry a good deal anyway suddenly have just cause — there’s a greater match between the state of the world and how they feel — and this is psychologically beneficial for them.</p>



<p>But how did these employees, as a group, manage to start this aspect of recovery immediately, when their stress levels were still high?</p>



<p>We are strongly motivated to tackle threats to our autonomy, the team notes. The study couldn’t reveal what changes, if any, the participants made in their lives. But they might have benefitted from a number of strategies, such as active detachment (spending time with pets, perhaps), relaxation, fostering a sense of mastery (if only through learning how to use Zoom…), even suddenly being able to wear whatever they wanted while working.</p>



<p>Still, as the participants’ stress levels were still high, their recovery was only partial. More research is clearly needed to explore what remedial strategies can help to rebuild autonomy — and to explore what happens to this marker of wellbeing (as well as others) into the longer term. But the study does  at least reveal that (for people with jobs, and of course that’s worth stressing) our psychological immune system is able to rally against at least some aspects of an attack like COVID-19.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></h4>

<p>For decades there have been murders of unarmed black people by the police, which in recent years has been exposed and protested by the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This summer, unprecedented numbers of protesters have voiced their outrage in response to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the very recent and utterly senseless shooting of Jacob Black, and countless other acts of violence. Many mayors have announced plans for reform. The protests have rightly focused on the roles of race and racism in police brutality, but more attention needs to be given to the role of gender, particularly as municipalities seek to repair the police force to avoid this unnecessary use of force and violence.</p><p>Using data from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department in California, a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807313995?journalCode=cjbb&amp;">2008 study</a> found that male officers were three times more likely to commit unwarranted shootings than their female counterparts. Additionally, white male police officers were 57% more likely than Latino male officers to commit such a shooting. These statistics refer to the group that constitutes the majority of police officers in America—white men.</p><p>But even more importantly, the culture of police departments tends to be macho and hyper-masculine—<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J012v16n03_01">a culture which glorifies violence</a>. This has always been the case but it has intensified as police departments across the county have moved from the community policing approach to militarization, aided by federal grants.</p><p>While among the general public masculinity is seen as synonymous with being male, psychologists view it differently—as a set of social norms, in this case norms for how boys and men should think, act, and feel. Masculinity is problematic in that that most boys are made to feel that they must conform to gender norms—that is, act in ways consistent with their gender. Masculinity is presented as obligatory for most boys, and most <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037262">boys feel they have no other choice but to conform to masculine norms</a>. This is not true for girls, who are given much more flexibility and latitude when it comes to their performance of gender than are boys. Furthermore, one of the principal functions of masculinity is to establish several hierarchies: of men over women, of white men over men of color, and of straight cisgender men over gay, bisexual, and transgender men.</p><p>To move away from the macho and hyper-masculine culture, police forces must diversify—not only in race but in gender—their ranks and leadership. The presence of many more women, openly LGBTQ people, and non-white officers on the police force, and deploying training designed to heighten awareness of masculinity and its relationship to violence, will be crucial in this regard.</p><p>Although most boys are expected to conform to masculinity norms, most adult men come to accept who they are, even if they do not meet the masculinity ideals. Masculinity is, after all, a tough standard. That is, they come to terms with the messages from their childhoods and recognize that their unique personalities do not fit or need to fit the ideal in all ways, perhaps saying to themselves “I am not the most masculine guy in the world but that’s OK.” A smaller group feels deeply ashamed of themselves for violating the masculine norms. Experimental research using the “precarious manhood” paradigm has shown that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402669">such men, when their masculinity is threatened, tend to respond with aggression</a>.</p><p>The research that has been conducted over the past 40+ years shows that one or another scale that measures masculinity is correlated with one or another harmful outcome, many related to violence. Since most adult men do not conform to masculine norms, what accounts for these harmful outcomes? One source is the group of men who respond to threats to their masculinity aggressively. In addition, masculinity’s destructive outcomes also arise from those men who “check all the boxes,” and conform to masculine norms to the greatest extent. These are the men whom we might label as hyper-masculine. Both groups of men tend to populate police departments as currently constituted. Their influence must be diluted by diversifying police forces.</p><p><em>Featured image by Free-Photos from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/squad-car-police-lights-city-urban-1209719/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/635333678/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/campus-activists-show-us-how-to-end-gender-based-violence/" rel="nofollow">Campus activists show us how to end gender-based violence</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/little-boy-1635065_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Adverse childhood experiences related to negative health outcomes</strong></p>
<p>As researchers, we often try to pinpoint the causes of negative outcomes in adults. What factors contribute to obesity? What about heart disease? Why are some people more prone to depression and anxiety while others are not? Surely it is not random chance why some individuals are more prone to these outcomes while others are not.</p>
<p>While each outcome may be linked to something specific (i.e., a person’s chance of getting lung cancer increases exponentially if they smoke), there is one factor that has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes like lung cancer, heart disease, anxiety, depression, obesity, unemployment, divorce, and even poor athletic performance.</p>
<p>What’s the factor that is linked to all of these outcomes?  The term is called “adverse childhood experiences,” or ACEs for short.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, a researcher named Vincent Felitti ran an obesity clinic in California. Around 50% of the participants dropped out, while the other 50% successfully completed the program. He decided to interview many of the dropouts, and found a common theme: Nearly all of them experienced some form of sexual, physical, or mental abuse as children. Interviews from the group that completed the program revealed only a very small percentage reported the same abuse.</p>
<p>Felitti eventually collaborated with a colleague, Robert Anda, in a large study of 17,000 individuals. In that study, Felitti and Anda identified eight domains of ACEs: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, parental separation/divorce, interpersonal violence, incarcerated family member, family mental illness, and family substance use.</p>
<p>Regardless of the event, Felitti and Anda found that the more numerical experiences an individual had, the more likely they were to have negative outcomes as adults.  Essentially, every person has an ACE score, ranging from 0 (no adverse events before the age of 18) to 8 (adverse events in all 8 categories).</p>
<p>All this said, public health researchers and practitioners in all areas of prevention/intervention (e.g., mental health professionals, substance abuse counselors, etc.), have been trying to develop programs which either 1. Limit the number of ACEs people have, or 2. Help people deal with their ACEs as adults in order to help lessen their effect.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>This is where our recent article titled, “The Frequencies and Disparities of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the U.S.” published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> helps advance the field of ACEs.  In the article, we collected the most comprehensive ACEs dataset to date: 211,376 adults across 34 states.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study helps shed light on precisely who is at-risk for higher ACEs. We report several noteworthy findings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</li>
<li>Almost one-quarter (22%) experienced three or more ACEs.</li>
<li>Women were more likely to experience ACEs compared to men</li>
<li>Black, Hispanic, and Multi-racial individuals were more likely to have more ACEs compared to White individuals.</li>
<li>People who identify as a sexual minority (lesbian, gay, or bisexual) were more likely to have more ACEs compared to heterosexual individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future implications</strong></p>
<p>So what does this all mean? There are several implications to the study. First, the more we know about ACEs, the greater the chances we have in both preventing ACEs and lessening their effect.  Next, ACEs are not equally distributed amongst the general population.  Some groups have a higher likelihood of experiencing ACEs, making them uniquely more prone to negative outcomes due to ACEs. Having insight into which groups are particularly vulnerable to ACEs is helpful for professionals that work in fields dealing with the repercussions of ACEs (like mental health counselors). Knowledge about which groups have a higher likelihood of ACE exposure will aid in tailoring programmatic responses to these groups.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/BNEP-blog-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at an extremely high risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  In addition, most patients have additional risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Should more be done to help improve their risk and overall health? What if clinicians could prescribe an exercise regimen? Are there additional hemodialysis specific benefits to exercising?</p>
<p>In a recent <em>BMC Nephrology </em>publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02021-2">Bogataj et al.</a> performed a randomised controlled trial to examines the effects of intradialytic cycling and functional training on dialysis adequacy and other biochemical parameters. Participants were divided into a functional training intervention group (with intradialytic cycling) and an intradialytic cycling only control group. For the first eight weeks, participants in the intervention group performed guided functional exercise training three times a week before each dialysis session and additional intradialytic cycling exercise. This included a warm-up, full range of motion exercises with additional weights, and a cool-down with stretching.  For the second eight weeks the same group took the functional training home to do on non-dialysis days. The authors concluded that in both groups the dialysis adequacy improved and was sustained through the entire study; however, additional benefits were found in the intervention group, with promising improvements in the participants’ total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<p>The improvement in dialysis adequacy with exercise during hemodialysis is not new. In 2004, <a href="https://www.dustri.com/article_response_page.html?artId=480&amp;doi=10.5414/CNP61261&amp;L=0">Parsons et al.</a> also conducted an eight week study looking at intradialytic exercise and found that there was enhanced dialysate urea removal. The physiology of how improved dialysis adequacy occurs is thought to be through an increase in muscle blood flow and increase in oxygen extraction, which increases capillary surface area and increases the exchange of substances from the tissue to the vascular compartment. This increased diffusion into the vascular compartment allows for substances like urea to be removed by dialysis.  Therefore, improved dialysis adequacy. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/14/12/2927/1818764">Kong et al.</a> demonstrated a 14% increase in dialysis adequacy from 60 minutes of intradialytic exercise.  This increase is equivalent to increasing a dialysis session by 20 minutes. It would be interesting to find out how many of my patients would prefer cycling during dialysis for an hour rather than increasing their dialysis time. Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p>
<blockquote><p>Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Bogataj et al article, there was also improvement in total cholesterol and LDL for the intervention group. There is clear evidence for preventing major cardiovascular events and mortality with lowering LDL for those with normal or slightly abnormal kidney function. For patients with CKD and ESKD, it can still be controversial. Our guidelines do not advocate starting every ESKD patient on a statin but what about lowering cholesterol with exercise? This type of intervention for cholesterol improvement still needs to be studied over a longer period with examining cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>If budget was not an issue, I might consider purchasing customized cycling equipment for my in-center hemodialysis patients and hiring a kinesiologist or personal trainer to perform rounds in the dialysis unit like our dietician and social worker. With time, I imagine we will have larger, longer duration studies that will further support the idea that a novel exercise prescription strategy has specific health benefits for patients with CKD.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Not all confessions are created equal. In a criminal justice setting, some admissions of guilt are both sincere and corroborated — but others are not, having been coerced, given by vulnerable or underage defendants, or unreliably reported secondhand. Yet mock jury trials have shown that lay people often tend to take a confession at face value, handing down a guilty verdict without considering other potential evidence.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Fabiana Alceste from City University of New York and colleagues question just how well people really understand the existing body of evidence on reliable, admissible confessions in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acp.3735">new paper in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em></a>. The answer to that question could have ramifications not only for those on juries but also for the people they’re deciding whether to convict.</p>


<p><span id="more-40254"></span></p>


<p>To examine lay beliefs, the researchers presented 151 participants with thirty statements related to interviews, interrogations and confessions, some true and some false. These statements had previously been presented to a panel of confession experts, and related to one of four areas: general principles of psychology (e.g. “compared to most adults, adolescents exhibit immaturity of judgment in their decision-making”), truth and deception detection (e.g. “trained police can distinguish between truths and lies at high levels of accuracy”), police interrogation tactics (e.g. “threats of physical violence during interrogation can lead an innocent person to confess to a crime”), and confessions (e.g. “confessions can be verified as true by the details that they contain about the crime”).</p>



<p>After viewing each statement, participants indicated how reliable they thought the evidence behind it was, responding with either: “the reverse is probably true”, “the evidence does not support it”, “the evidence is inconclusive”, “the evidence tends to favour it”, “the evidence is generally reliable”, “the evidence is very reliable”, or “I don’t know”. Participants also indicated whether or not they <em>personally</em> agreed or disagreed with each assertion, as well as stating whether or not they believed a jury would benefit from hearing testimony from an expert in a trial involving a disputed confession.</p>



<p>A majority of participants correctly endorsed all of the statements relating to psychological principles — the effects of reward and punishment on behaviour, adolescent decision-making and sleep deprivation, for example. Experts and laypeople were generally in agreement on these statements, though experts endorsed them at significantly higher rates.</p>



<p>When it came to deception detection, however, a majority of participants endorsed <em>unsupported</em> statements — that trained experts can accurately judge truth or lies from facial microexpressions, for example, or through non-verbal behavioural cues. The panel of experts, on the other hand, correctly rejected these propositions.</p>



<p>There were also some large discrepancies when it came to interrogation tactics. While 84% of participants correctly identified that torture can get innocent people to confess, only 56% believed that false claims of evidence implicating the suspect in the crime can do the same — versus 94% of experts who asserted that it can. Worryingly, significantly more participants believed Miranda rights (your “right to remain silent”) adequately protected against false confessions — 49% to the experts’ 25%.</p>



<p>When the team looked at beliefs about <em>reliability</em> of research, however, the gap between participants and experts widened further. Both laypeople and experts personally disagreed with the statement “innocent people never provide false confessions voluntarily”, for instance — but while nearly every expert indicated the research did not support the statement, many laypeople believed the evidence was still inconclusive or even supported the statement.. The same disparity was  found for a number of other statements about confessions.</p>



<p>Almost all participants — 94% — believed that juries would benefit from hearing expert testimony. Yet they rarely answered “I don’t know” to the questions, suggesting that they were not particularly clear on their <em>own</em> lack of knowledge. Future research could explore this  gap further by looking at participants’ confidence in each answer — working out whether people don’t know what they don’t know, in other words.</p>



<p>Despite the clear value of expert knowledge on confessions, many courtrooms do not accept it as admissible testimony, instead relying on juries using common sense. But that “common sense”, as this study highlights, does not always match up to the body of evidence surrounding confessions.</p>



<p>The team suggests that confession experts <em>should</em> be permitted to give testimony to juries, who may not possess reliable information about admissible evidence and instead harbour incorrect beliefs. Understanding interview, interrogation and confession isn’t just an intellectual matter — the serious ramifications that emerge from a lack of knowledge can literally be a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>Finishing off a big task can be memorable, whether you sincerely feel you’ve achieved something or are just relieved to have got it out of the way. Everyday tasks, however, are much more mundane: taking your daily medication or typing in a password are unlikely to be particularly noteworthy events.</p>



<p>You may also have found a gap between your <em>intention</em> to do a particular mundane task and actually enacting it — meaning you either can’t remember whether you actually did it, or misremember having done it entirely. It’s this phenomenon that Dolores Albarracin and colleagues from the University of Illinois explore for the first time in a new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220929203">paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. </p>


<p><span id="more-40236"></span></p>


<p>In the first part of the study, participants played the part of a manager reviewing applications to model for a clothing brochure. In some cases, participants were asked whether they wanted to hire the applicant immediately; in others, they were asked to state whether they <em>intended</em> to hire the applicant later; and in a control condition, were asked to state whether the gender listed in a form about the applicant matched the gender of their photo.</p>



<p>After a brief break, participants saw each applicant again and indicated whether or not they had made a final hire decision in the previous part of the study. As anticipated, participants were more likely to mistakenly believe they had already hired (or rejected) applicants in the “intention” condition than those in the control condition — suggesting that we sometimes mistake having intended to do something with having actually done it.</p>



<p>Next, using the same process, the team showed that  this effect was more pronounced when there are physical similarities between behaviour and intention — in short, when doing something and intending to do something feel or look the same.</p>



<p>Participants in the high similarity condition pressed a key on their keyboard for both the “behaviour” (the definite hiring decisions) and “intention”  (the intended hiring decisions), while those in the low similarity condition enacted <em>behaviour</em> with a keystroke but <em>intention</em> mentally, simply thinking about their intention rather than logging it.</p>



<p>Those in the high similarity condition were more likely to confuse intention with behaviour than those in the low similarity condition, indicating that a similarity in expression may increase the odds of falsely remembering having completed a task (opening an email you intend to respond to later, for example, rather than leaving it unread or adding it to a to do list, may make you more likely to misremember having sent your response).</p>



<p>In the next study, participants judged some candidates by attractiveness and others by competence. As before, participants used these criteria to either register their intention to do something or actually enact behaviour.  Again, intentions were misreported as enactments far more than the other way around; similarly, misreports were far more likely within the same hiring criteria than in a different one (i.e. an intention to hire based on attractiveness was more likely to be misremembered as having actually hired the candidate based on attractiveness than as having actually hired them based on competence). As in the keystroke study, this suggests that similarities in the cognitive processes involved in behaviour and intentions are a key part of mistaken beliefs.</p>



<p>Mistaking intentions for behaviours, even for mundane actions, is not insignificant. Small acts  can be important in many areas of our life: the actual act of taking medication, for instance, may be routine and uninteresting, but its impact is often far from it. Results from this study suggest, however, that it’s something we may frequently misremember doing because the physical actions are so samey.</p>



<p>Results from a final study may indicate a fairly useful — and pretty simple — solution to the problem of misremembering behaviours: active monitoring. Participants who physically wrote down their final hiring decision or their intention to hire were less likely to misremember what they’d done. Writing things down or checking them off a list might not be failsafe — and it might not be very exciting itself — but it could be a good way to ensure that things are getting done.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s one of the best-known and also controversial experiments in psychology: in 1963, Stanley Milgram reported that, when instructed, many people are surprisingly willing to deliver apparently dangerous electrical shocks to others. For some researchers, this — along with follow-up studies by the team — reveals how acting “under orders” can undermine our moral compass.</p>



<p>Milgram’s interpretation of his findings, and the methods, too, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">have been criticised</a>. However, the results have largely been replicated in experiments run in <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/news-and-media">the US</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/">Poland</a>, and elsewhere. And in 2016, a brain-scanning study revealed that when we perform an act under coercion vs freely, our brain processes it more like a passive action rather than a voluntary one.</p>



<p>Now a new study, from a group that specialises in the neuroscience of empathy, takes this further: Emilie Caspar at the Social Brain Lab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and colleagues report in <em>NeuroImage</em> that when we follow orders to hurt someone, there is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307370?via=ihub">reduced activity in brain networks involved in our ability to feel another’s pain</a>. What’s more, this leads us to perceive pain that we inflict as being less severe. This process could, then, help to explain the dark side of obedience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40226"></span></p>


<p>Most of the 40 participants recruited for the new work were women, and their average age was about 25. None knew each other before arriving at the lab, where they were studied in gender-matched pairs. Within each pair, one person was randomly chosen to first be the “agent”, and the other the “victim” (they would later switch roles). The agent was taken to an MRI scanner in one room, while the victim was seated in another, electrodes attached to their hand. While in the scanner, the agent could see a live video of the victim’s hand, so they could observe the (genuine) impact of their actions.</p>



<p>The task itself was split into four blocks of 30 trials each. During two of the blocks, the agent was told “you can decide” whether or not to press a button to inflict a mildly painful electrical shock to the victim. During the other two blocks, half the time they were given the instruction “Shock”, and half the time “No Shock”. Each shock the agent gave was “rewarded” with €0.05.</p>



<p>The team found that, on average, people were less likely to administer a shock when it was up to them. (Still, the number of shocks was not negligible: an average of 23 out of the 60 “you decide” trials vs 30 of the 60 instructed trials. Statistically, there’s a significant difference between the two figures, but there clearly isn’t a chasm.)</p>



<p>Caspar and her colleagues used the brain imaging data to look closely at three distinct patterns of activity: the “vicarious pain signature” (associated with feeling other people’s pain); the “neurologic pain signature” (associated with experiencing pain directly) and the “interpersonal guilt signature” (observable when we feel guilt over a harmful impact on another person). The team found that when someone was obeying orders to administer a shock, rather than choosing to do so, both the vicarious pain signature and the interpersonal guilt signature were less intense.</p>



<p>Tallying with the brain imaging results, the participants reported feeling less bad, and less sorry, about inflicting pain when acting under orders — and they reported that these shocks looked less severe on the video. As the researchers note, this was despite the fact that the participants had been told the shocks would always be of the same intensity. “Obeying orders has such a strong influence on the perception of pain felt by others that it even impacts perceptual reports of observed shock intensity,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>All in all, the results imply that when we’re acting under orders to hurt someone, we don’t find it as personally unpleasant as when we hurt someone freely. Part of the reason we normally don’t hurt other people is because we’d feel at least some of their pain ourselves, but when obeying orders this vicarious response is reduced — so we’re more likely to harm them.</p>



<p>The team argues that a sense of responsibility and/or agency (feeling that we are the author of our own actions) is key: when these are reduced, so too is our empathy for pain that we inflict, with potentially dire results. The results “highlight how obeying an order relaxes our aversion against harming others, despite still being the author of the action that led to the pain,” they write.</p>



<p>But why might this happen? Is there something more fundamental going on?</p>



<p>Remember that in this study — as in other similar studies — the participants were acting under the clear orders of an authority figure with an electric shock machine at their disposal. As for all living things, our prime directives are to survive and thrive. Imagine in the real world being ordered by someone in authority to harm another person. You might recognise (even unconsciously) that your choice is either to obey, or disobey and risk being hurt yourself — either physically, or in terms of your career. An evolved ability to dial down your empathy for someone else’s pain in such a situation could be of benefit to you.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Stories about discriminatory practices against Black people with natural hairstyles (e.g. afros, twists, dreadlocks, braids and cornrows) abound. At school, having natural hair has led to detention, punishment and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/black-pupils-excluded-hair-discrimination-equality-act">exclusions</a>, and previous <a href="https://perception.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TheGood-HairStudyFindingsReport.pdf">research</a> has also found serious stigma around natural hair when it comes to desirability and professionalism.</p>



<p>A new study in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620937937?journalCode=sppa"><em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em><u> </u></em>backs this up, finding that such biases can tangibly affect Black women’s chances with potential employers. Christy Zhou Koval at Michigan State University and Ashleigh Shelby Rosette at Duke University found that Black women with natural hairstyles were seen as less competent and less professional than White female applicants or Black applicants with straightened hair — and that they were less likely to get job interviews, too.</p>


<p><span id="more-40194"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 480 participants imagined themselves as a recruiter, tasked with evaluating job applicants based on their Facebook profile. The applicants themselves had a wide range of different hairstyles, but fell into one of four groups: White women with curly or straight hair, and Black women with natural or straightened hair. Participants rated each applicant on professionalism and competence, and indicated how likely they would be to select the applicant for an interview.</p>



<p>As expected, Black women with natural hairstyles were rated as less professional and less competent than Black women with straightened hair and White women with both curly and straight hair (though curly-haired White women were ranked as less professional than their straight-haired counterparts). Black women with natural hair were also the group least likely to be recommended for interview.</p>



<p>A second study replicated this process — except this time, participants saw multiple pictures of the same women with different hairstyles. The effect held: Black women were seen as less professional, less competent and less likely to be invited to interview when they were depicted with natural hair.</p>



<p>A further study looked at the role of industry in perception of natural hair. This time, participants were told they were recruiting either for the <em>consulting</em> industry (traditionally more conservative) or the <em>advertising industry </em>(more laidback). In the consulting condition, Black women with natural hair were again considered less professional and less competent and again received fewer recommendations for interview than Black women with straightened hair. In advertising, however, there was no difference in either professionalism or interview recommendations. A further study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>The results highlight the need for an intersectional approach to understanding workplace discrimination. It’s obviously true that women often experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/">extensive</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/">biases</a> at work because of their gender — but these biases can be compounded or experienced in completely different ways by women of colour. The discrimination outlined in this study is certainly not the only kind experienced by Black women — and, as the team notes, other women of colour experience stigma around their appearance too. Headscarves, to use just one example, may also affect hiring practices.     </p>



<p>Future research could look at more natural scenarios — although some employers do look at social media profiles while hiring, examining biases during in-person interviews could provide further insights.</p>



<p>The findings from the second part of the study suggest that differing norms between sectors may play a key part in perpetuating inequality. It follows that addressing such systemic racism is an important part in addressing these sorts of biases. Public policies, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/army-ban-on-dreadlocks-black-servicewomen.html">seen</a> in some parts of the US, may also help to protect Black women from employment discrimination: in four US states, for example, it’s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/virginia-hair-discrimination-ban">illegal to discriminate</a> based on someone’s hairstyle.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that although this study was conducted in an American context, the problem exists across the world — as Irish writer Emma Dabiri points out in her <a href="https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-protect-afro-textured-hair-amend-the-uk-equality-act-to-include-hair">petition</a> to amend the UK Equality Act to include hair discrimination. Research looking at exactly how these biases operate in other countries is key to understanding and tackling such practices.</p>

<p>We’re always working to improve your experience on arXiv.org. Here’s a summary of recent changes that we hope will make your life as an author easier.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements for the author experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are now allowing more time for TeX to run the compilation, so “time out” errors will occur less frequently.</li>
<li>arXiv will detect cases where a second compilation process is needed and run it automatically. This ensures that your bibliography will display correctly.</li>
<li>Triggering a second compilation also fixes related footnote formatting issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Smaller bug fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix on the automatic recognition of arXiv IDs links</li>
<li>Fix to hyperref options to support more options for web links</li>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5xUm1rHSfOw/">Theme of 2020 Open Access Week to be Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion</a></h4>

<p>This post was written by Nick Shockey and first appeared on <a href="http://openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/2020-theme-announcement-english">openaccessweek.org</a> and has since been reposted on <a href="https://sparcopen.org/">sparcopen.org.</a> Nick is the Director of Programs and Engagement for SPARC.</p>



<p>The 2020 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year’s International Open Access Week, to be held October 19-25, will be “Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion.”</p>



<p>Openness can be a powerful tool for building more equitable systems of sharing knowledge. Rebuilding research and scholarship to be open by default presents a unique opportunity to construct a foundation that is fundamentally more equitable. Yet today, structural racism, discrimination, and exclusion are present and persistent in places where openness is a core value. As a global community, it is important to understand that the systems and spaces of the present are often built upon legacies of historic injustice and that addressing these inequities is a necessity.  </p>



<p>We need to examine who these spaces and systems are designed for, who is missing, who is excluded by the business models we use, and whose interests are prioritized. As we work together to rebuild these structures, we need to commit to moving from conversations to concrete commitments and to hold one another accountable for making real progress.</p>



<p>Building on our discussions in 2018 (“Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge”) and 2019 (“Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge”), 2020 marks the third consecutive year the theme for International Open Access Week will focus on the urgent need for action on equity and inclusion, underscoring the urgency of continuing to center this work.</p>



<p>International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year’s Open Access Week will be held from October 19th through the 25th; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year’s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true for this year with the varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/-NFg9bVWp4w/">Author Interview: Arunima Malik on Global Effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Arunima Malik and an international team of researchers recently assessed how the Coronavirus pandemic has caused worldwide consumption losses amounting to more than US$3.8 trillion while simultaneously spawning the largest recorded drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Their <em>PLOS ONE </em>paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235654"><em>Global socio-economic losses and environmental gains from the Coronavirus pandemic</em>,</a>” highlights the inherent dilemma of the global socio-economic system and the need for increased global cooperation and solidarity. Read on to see their thoughts on the need to move beyond discipline boundaries, the effects of their research on policy and more. </p>



<p><em><strong>The list of authors on this article spans the globe, with researchers affiliated with Australia, Japan, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, United States, and the United Kingdom. Can you speak on how this team was formed?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: The assessment presented in our published study was undertaken in the Global Industrial Ecological Virtual Laboratory — a cloud computing environment that brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and universities to foster new and innovative research.</p>



<p>We formed the multi-regional multi-disciplinary team to allow us to capture insights and data related to COVID-19 for not just English, but also for a range of languages. We followed a three-tier approach to enable us to best capture global events related to the pandemic. We note in the manuscript: “In addition to English, and in alphabetical order, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish were used in our search, thus covering languages spoken by over 5 billion people.”</p>



<p><em><strong>What drives you in your field of research, and why do you believe your research is important?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: I am passionate about understanding impacts embodied in complex supply chains. It’s important to be able to understand how systems are interconnected, and how effects in one system ripple through other systems. Sustainability applies to us all, and I enjoy being able to contribute to this evolving field of research. Regarding the current pandemic, these ripple effects have been further emphasized on a global scale. </p>



<p><em><strong>How crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of your research? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: My research is interdisciplinary as it brings together concepts and methodologies from a range of disciplines. It is therefore important to have structures that support interdisciplinary review and dissemination of results. There is a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research for understanding complex sustainability-related issues.</p>



<p><em><strong>What impact is your research having in your scientific community, in the media, and more widely? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: Research in supply chain analysis is definitely gaining relevance, and we are now starting to see the use of input-output tables by organisations for sustainability assessments. Input output analysis has been used in the reports published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Stockholm Environment Institute — such as the report on the <a href="https://www.sei.org/publications/spillovers-sdg-implementation-soy-argentina/">Argentina-EU soy supply chain</a> regarding impacts on Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr.</em> <em><a href="https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/people/bing-xue">Bing Xue</a>, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany, speaks on the importance of Arunima’s research and supply chain analyses. </em></p>



<p>BX: The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, triggering a great debate in the economic circles on the impact of the epidemic. As a result of the lockdown and other measures taken by various countries to deal with the pandemic, the supply chain at the enterprise level was disrupted, which led to the shutdown of global value chain trade, specifically in terms of consumption loss, income loss and employment loss. At the same time, due to the ripple effect of supply chain disruption, some polluting companies have reduced output, reducing GHG and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which has a positive impact on the environment. </p>



<p>Looking at the world as a cohesive whole, global MRIO-based supply-chain analyses helps to clearly understand the different impacts on countries in different positions of global value chain. The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on some important conditions for the rise and rapid progress of economic globalization, stimulating the restructuring of global value chains. </p>



<p>What is more important is the orderly development of economic globalization after the pandemic. Based on the perspective of the global industrial chain, how to cope with the impact of the outbreak and spread of the pandemic on the supply chain is an issue that should be concerned by the scientific community.</p>



<p><em>I would like to thank Arunima and Bing for their research and for taking the time to provide their thoughtful comments. </em></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></h4>

<p>In a previous <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">post</a> I described topics of conversations to have with a teenager leaving home for college. Equally, if not more important, is the process of communication.</p><p><strong>Understand the positive power of a strong family foundation</strong>. The power of a supportive family is almost unlimited.  Let me be clear that a family does not need to consist of a heterosexual mother and father, 2.5 children, and a golden retriever. A family is a group of people who are committed to one another for the long run, based on their love. If students understand that no matter what, they can depend on their family, any transition will be easier. Research supports this view: the same study of anxiety and depression during the pandemic revealed that family support was associated with fewer psychological disorders.</p><p><strong>Develop your family communication skills.</strong>  The first step in the communication process may sound simple at first: listen. Too many parents, especially when anxious, tend to lecture, perhaps the worst possible strategy for communicating with teens.  You can express your emotions first, not to meet your needs but to normalize a conversation about feelings.  A parent can open a conversation with a statement like,  “I know this is a hard time for most of us, and I know I’m a bit worried. How are you feeling?” In this way, you acknowledge that it is OK to be frightened or anxious. Listening takes time, accepting some silence, and it isn’t always easy. Your teen may brush you off at first—that’s okay, there will be other opportunities. Keep the lines of communication.</p><p><strong>Accept that communication may change</strong>. Flexibility will be key for a positive transition to college.  You may hear from your child less often: embrace that as growth. He is learning to depend on other people for support, expanding his social world.  He may primarily use texting or short phone calls when he’s walking.  You also have the right to let your child know that you need to hear from them now and then.  But don’t invade their space by reading their Instagram or Twitter. You can respect their privacy and if you want to learn more about campus life, subscribe to the student newspaper or check the college website. Other students, especially during these uncertain times, may want to stay connected and text or call often. If you already text or talk on the phone with your teen frequently, the contact may stay the same or increase. They are letting you know what they need. There is no absolute right or wrong rate of communication, especially during the first few months of the college transition.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. It is axiomatic in mental health that if a parent feels psychologically healthy, so will a child.  To support your student, they need to feel that you are OK, that they can leave knowing that the situation at home is solid. This doesn’t mean that your family will be free of stress, but that you will be able to cope or find solutions to problems that arise. This is called “self-efficacy.” You may have lost your job or suffered financial setbacks during this time, or worse, lost a loved one to COVID-19. And you are probably going to miss your child. You may be under additional pressure if you are a single parent, a member of a minority group, or if you work on the front lines of healthcare or a service industry. It also appears that mothers who work outside the home may also be doing the lion’s share of the housework and educational needs of their children. Try to take time for yourself by establishing <strong>daily</strong> relaxing rituals, like short meditations or breathing exercises or listening to music.

<p><strong>PhD in Computational &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience</strong></p>
<p>An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force.</p>
<p>The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.</p>
<p>We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.</p>
<p>The 3-year full-time PhD studentship includes a stipend of £15,285 per annum in addition to covering tuition fees. <strong>Only EU and UK citizens are eligible to apply.</strong>
The start date of the PhD will be January 2021.</p>
<p>The PhD will be supervised by Dr Shabnam Kadir (University of Hertfordshire), Dr Elena Antonova (Brunel University London), Prof Robert Leech (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London), and Prof Chrystopher Nehaniv (University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).</p>
<p>Interested candidates are encouraged to make informal inquiries with Dr Shabnam Kadir (<code>s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk</code>) before making a formal application.</p>
<p>To apply, submit <a class="reference external" href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf">an application form</a> (downloadable from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf">https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf</a>) together with a cover letter, CV, and scanned copies of  university transcripts and degree certificates (BSc, and if relevant MSc) via email to <code>doctoralcollegeadmissions AT herts.ac.uk</code>, cc-ing Dr Kadir on <code>s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk</code> and Dr Antonova on <code>elena.antonova AT brunel.ac.uk</code></p>

<p>Dogs are much more than just pets. With an innately acute sense of smell up to 100,000 times greater than ours, dogs can be trained to detect not only drugs and explosives but also the scent of individuals with cancer, malaria and other diseases. Now, as this pilot <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05281-3/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">randomized controlled trial</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">BMC Infectious Diseases</a></em> shows, they can also be trained to detect those with coronavirus.<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12087 alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/neil-fedorowycz-hHCDldR1ZcQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>In their study, Prof. Holger Volk and colleagues at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover presented dogs with samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive or –negative nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.</p>
<p>This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.</p>

<p>With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer. In their recently published study in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, Mensah and Adjei look at how gender and the level of welfare provision by the state impact the association between work-life balance and self-reported health. The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

<p>Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, Clayton <em>et al. </em>systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.</p>

<p>High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a>, Li <em>et al.</em> use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.</p>
<p>Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.</p>
<p>Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms. An understanding of these mechanisms may prove useful in future efforts to promote stress tolerance in commercially important crops like sugar beet.</p>

<p>Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a>, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.</p>
<blockquote><p>befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.</p>

As they focus on their self-development, emerging adults feel in-between, on the way to adulthood but not there yet. Nevertheless, they have a high level of optimism about what the future holds for them.</p><p>In the current climate, emerging adults are facing more instability than ever before. Whether it’s starting university, forging new relationships, or entering the job market – the uncertainty surrounding these milestones has presented many new challenges, and exacerbated the more common anxieties of adjusting to change. We’ve put together a reading list of books that address some of the key issues facing emerging adults – in areas such as education, work, relationships, and mental health – and provide advice and approaches for managing this turbulent stage of life.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mood-prep-101-9780190914301"><strong>Mood Prep 101: A Parent’s Guide to Preventing Depression and Anxiety in College-Bound Teens</strong></a> by Carol Landau</p><p>This book answers the question most parents have – “What can we do?” – when it comes to college-bound teens who may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression.

                <h4><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/alignment-tools/">Alignment tools</a></h4>

<p>This blog posts covers some tools and techniques that I’m typically using to align two-photon microscopes. If you’re an expert, you will probably find nothing new, but if you haven’t been doing this for years, this might offer you some pieces of inspiration.</p>



<p>Aligning a microscope is the process of optimizing the parts to produce better images than before. A useful overview of basic alignment procedures for two-photon microscopes has been put together in this <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/neurowire/labhacks-how-to-align-your-laser-for-two-photon-imaging">#LabHacks blog post</a> by Scientifica. It also includes safety advice (which I will not repeat here; keep in mind that lasers, especially pulsed IR-laser, are really dangerous, and all safety instructions of your institute and lab must always be obeyed!)</p>



<p>Microscope alignment still seems to be a secret art that most microscope users are afraid of. It is not by principle difficult to learn, but it is a practical skill and requires both patience and a mentor who shows where to buy stuff and how to touch the mechanical and optical elements. Most people working with microscopes are prevented from learning because they are afraid to touch anything. This blog post is intended to help lower the fear of optical alignment – by showing that the tools used for alignment can be very simple.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1. Adjust the beam to a given height above the optical breadboard</strong></p>



<p>After the beam comes out of the laser, you often want to keep the beam in one single plane parallel to the table, in order to keep things simple. In other words, the distance of the beam from the optical table should be the same everywhere. One way to achieve this is to use mounted pinholes (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=206">these ones from Thorlabs</a>). However, it is sometimes difficult to properly see where the beams hits the pinhole, which results in imprecise alignment and unnecessary uncertainty. When I worked with <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/prevedel/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60022898">Robert Prevedel </a>in 2013/2014, he showed me a simple trick which makes it very easy to adjust all beam positions to the same height. He used a small hex key and two washers to clamp it horizontally onto an inverted post with a screw, as shown below. The surfaces of the hex key lead to a very nice horizontal alignment, and the precise height indicated by the hex key can be used to (1) adjust the beam itself or (2) to consistently adjust the height of a set of pin holes. It is useful to have and very simple to make.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Printed-out resolution targets</strong></p>



<p>Is the beam centered in a given aperture, for example the cage system of the microscope’s tube lens? Normally, I would use a threaded or cage-mounted iris (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">this one</a>), but in other cases spatial constraints do not allow this, or the beam can only be viewed from an angle, and it can be difficult to judge whether the beam scattering from the iris is centered or not. </p>



<p>However, if the laser power is low enough not to burn paper, I simply paint resolution targets with Powerpoint or Inkscape and print them out on a sheet of paper resolution targets. When I’m in a hurry, I simply draw it with a pen.</p>

<p>For example, if I want to check whether a beam is collimated (that means, the beam does not change its diameter a lot over the distance), I use these alignment targets as a reference and as a guide for the eye.</p>



<p>Or I use some scotch to fix it into a given aperture, allowing me to check whether the beam is centered or not. Here illustrated for the aperture which is approximately located at the back focal plane of the objective. Does not require much work but is quite helpful.</p>

<p><strong>3. Using mirrors to look around corners</strong></p>



<p>One more practical problem in the above case is the viewing angle. Ideally, I would like to look at the alignment target from the top, but this would at the same time block the beam. To solve this (and many very similar problems), you can simply use a mirror shard. The photo below (left) shows a hand-held piece of <strong>mirror</strong> which allows to look at the alignment target in a relaxed way. It is difficult to see this from a single picture, but mirrors like this one (either hand-held or fixed in the setup) often make life much easier.</p>



<p>For more convenience, <strong>dental mirrors</strong> like <a href="https://www.the-lash-shop.com/products/milimeter-metal-dental-mirror-handheld-black-and-gold-plasma">this mirror</a> (photo below, right) are designed to conveniently look around corners and are of great use to look at pinholes from angles that are difficult to get at without mirrors.</p>



<p>However, be very careful with hand-held and any other moving mirrors! By chance, you might reflect the laser beam into your own eyes! Always be careful and think three times whether there is any chance that any reflection might hit your eyes.</p>

<p><strong>4. Retro-reflecting mirrors and lenses</strong></p>



<p>Usually, the laser beam should hit a lens at its center and at a 90° angle. To ensure that the beam is centered, one can use a) a cage system with a pinhole, or b) a <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">threaded pinhole</a> that can be screwed onto the lens directly, or c) a printed-out removable resolution target (see above). To make sure that, in addition, the laser beam hits the lens with a 90° angle, it is helpful to use back-reflections of the beam. Since a small fraction of the beam is back-reflected by the lens surface, it should ideally coincide with the incoming beam. This can be checked with an IR detection card or, for a visible beam, a piece of paper held close to (but not hiding the) incoming beam path.</p>



<p>Sometimes it is necessary to align a caged element or something similar without lenses that provide back-reflecting surfaces. In this case, you can simply use a mirror that reflects the entire beam back. This mirror can be screwed into a thread of a cage system. More often, it suffices to put a small and flat mirror shard at the flat back of the caged system. This does not provide the highest precision alignment, but is usually good enough for most purposes.</p>



<p>Be aware that back-reflections that go directly back into the laser can make the laser unstable. If a pulsed laser stops pulsing, first check whether any back-reflections could be the reason for it. </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>5. Retro-reflecting gratings</strong></p>



<p>The main problem with back-reflections from lenses and mirrors is that the beam is often small and coincides with the incoming beam, making it difficult to properly identify.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a>, I inherited a really cool tool that was used for alignment of a Sutter MOM scope and which I was, unfortunately, unable to find afterwards on the internet. It is basically a mirror, but with a sort of grating scratched into the mirror surface. Due to interference, the back-reflections were not simply a single beam, but a symmetric diffraction pattern that extended over several centimeters and could be conveniently used for alignment – much more useful and easier to use than the back-reflections of a lens or mirror. I guess that any flat reflective gratings (maybe even compact discs? I have to tried that) could be used for this same purpose.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>6. Wedge plates</strong></p>



<p>At several points of the beam path (before entering the back of the objective; after exiting a beam expander) the laser beam should ideally be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_beam">collimated</a>. The standard method that I used for years was to print out a resolution target made of paper (described above). I used it to check whether the beam changes its diameter when propagating freely over several meters. To this end, it is often necessary to deflect the beam with a mirror that must be temporarily inserted into the beam path.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mesospim">Fabian Voigt</a> from my <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">current lab in Zürich</a> also showed me the more professional way to check for collimation, using a wedge plate. Wedge plates can be used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_interferometer">shearing interferometers</a> (<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2970">Thorlabs product</a>, <a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/paralinetrade-collimation-tester/11575/">EO product</a>). They generate an interference pattern which can be used to very precisely check the collimation of the beam.</p>

<p>Fabian also kindly pointed me to a paper (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-11-13833">Tsai et al., 2015</a>) which mentions that the pattern seen from a shearing interferometer can also be used to analyze less obvious properties of the beam, like coma and astigmatism aberrations (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-39-28-5179">Okuda et al., 2000</a>). It would be cool to have a look-up table of typical interferograms and the corresponding wavefront shapes and aberrations!</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>7. Alignment lasers</strong></p>



<p>Another tool that Fabian showed to me was an alignment laser.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6503" data-attachment-id="6503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1571242397&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.12&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="img_3787" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/img_3787/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>This alignment laser is basically a continuous wave-visible light laser that goes through a optical fiber and afterwards enters a beam coupler. I used a shearing interferometer (described above) to make sure that the outgoing beam was collimated, and then used the collimated beam for backward alignment.</p>



<p>Backward alignment means to insert the collimated beam of the alignment laser at the location of the microscope’s back focal plane and then aligning the microscope’s components in a backward manner (tube lens -&gt; scan lens -&gt; scanners -&gt; etc.; instead of forward alignment, which starts at the pulsed laser and goes forward until it ends up at the objective). This is helpful for example when two or more separate incoming beams are combined. A second advantage of the alignment laser is that the laser beam is, unlike the near-IR pulsed laser, visible to the human eye.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>8. Continuous wave (cw) mode for a pulsed Ti:Sa laser</strong></p>



<p>Standard two-photon microscopes are based on pulsed lasers that have a center wavelength adjusted between 800 and 1000 nm. The light is therefore invisible to the human eye (except for some faint spectral components when the center wavelength is adjusted to 800 nm) and comes with high average power (&gt;1 W, or often much more) and in ultra-short high-energy pulses, making it a very dangerous thing to deal with. IR viewer cards and IR viewers, or less expensive solutions based on <a href="https://labrigger.com/blog/2015/04/20/inexpensive-ir-viewer-options/">simple cameras/webcams</a>, can make the beam visible to our human eye, but I always found this very exhausting to work with. And being exhausted is not a good pre-condition for optical alignment, which requires the ability to stay focused and a sharp mind. Therefore, it would be great if it was possible to make the laser less dangerous: by preventing it from pulsing, by lowering the overall power, and by making it visible…</p>



<p>Fortunately, all of this is possible for the tunable wavelength Ti:Sa lasers (although not for the fixed 1040 nm lasers). For the Spectra Physics MaiTai lasers, the slightly old-fashioned user-interface (screenshot below) allows to manually lower the pump power (also called the “green power”). Change the wavelength to something visible (something between 700 and 750 nm), lower the green power until the pulsing (indicated by the green light in the main control window) stops and continue lowering the green power until the output IR power reaches something like 30-40 mW. This is still much more than the average laser pointer and still dangerous, but less so than a pulsed invisible beam.</p>



<p>It is however important to keep in mind that the control panel is not always 100% reliable. It switches between pulsing and non-pulsing as if these were binary states. But there is a sometimes continuous transition between the two, and sometimes the laser also becomes a bit unstable and oscillates between states – so, better watch the laser for a while before you start working with the beam.</p>

<p>I once talked to a laser engineer from Spectra Physics who told me that it would not be ideal to leave the laser in this non-pulsing state for too long (&gt;&gt; 1 hours). Probably this has something to do with inefficient energy conversion and the heat generated in this process. But I have to admit that I follow this recommendation simply because I don’t know it better. Lasers are complex things, and I mostly treat them in a pragmatic way, like a black box.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>9. Improvised test samples</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common mistakes that I keep seeing is to set up a microscope and then try to test it with a real sample, like a living brain of a transgenic mouse. That’s really not the best way to proceed. Instead, always test your microscope with a simple, bright and dead sample. (And, ideally in addtion also with sub-diffraction beads.)</p>



<p>For example, you can use colored plastic items (for example <a href="https://www.chroma.com/products/accessories/92001-autofluorescent-plastic-slides">plastic slides</a>), perfect to test how homogeneous the FOV is. Or <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/springtime-for-two-photon-microscopy/">pollen grains</a> from any flowers outdoors during the pollen season. Or dead, small insects that you caught from your desk. Their surface will often be super bright under a two-photon microscope, especially if you remove the emission filters. Or simply a single strand of your hair (especially if you have still some pigments in them).</p>



<p>In general, most solid things are somehow autofluorescent, and it can be really fun to look at random things below the two-photon microscope. Pay attention not to kill the PMT detector (lower the initial PMT gain), since autofluorescence of natural things can be very bright.</p>

<p class="">The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. It is located in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>. </p><h2>What is the fusiform face area and what does it do?</h2><p class="">By the late 1990s, researchers had built up a fair amount of evidence that suggested there are parts of our brain that are especially active when we look at faces. This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. </p><p class="">In 1997, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/" target="_blank">researchers published a groundbreaking study</a> that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri" target="_blank">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a> to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.</p><p class="">The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the <em>fusiform face area</em>, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as <em>prosopagnosia</em>, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.</p><p class="">Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/" target="_blank">found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery</a>, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/" target="_blank">caused disruptions in the perception of faces</a>. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term <em>fusiform face area</em>—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.</p><p class="">Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/">some argue</a> that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/">a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well</a>. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. </p><p class="">But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the <em>expertise hypothesis</em>, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/" target="_blank">one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased</a> in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/" target="_blank">Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts</a> viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/" target="_blank">another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA</a> when viewing x-rays than med students did. </p><p class="">The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/" target="_blank">a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies</a> found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. </p><p class=""><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></p><p class="">Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></h4>

<p>How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?</p><p>Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.</p><p>So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.</p><p>First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.</p><p>Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.</p><p>Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.<strong> </strong>I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.</p><p>Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.</p><p>Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children<strong> </strong>better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues. Important for parents to let this information guide their conversations. Their teenagers will feel validated and supported.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/student-leaving-school-after-classes_1314101.htm">Image</a> by Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633749722/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/" rel="nofollow">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a></h4>

<p>In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted">petitioned</a> for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder">granted clemency</a> and Brown was released from prison.</p><p>As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742">leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system</a>.</p><p>A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims</a>, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">told</a> her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.</p><p>Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color</a>, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10">which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights<em> </em>and pressure them to waive their rights</a>—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.</p><p>Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">often perceived</a> as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.</p><p>Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">often blamed</a> for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">more likely to be tried in adult criminal court</a> rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back">Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.</a></p><p>Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/">Image</a> by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/" rel="nofollow">How education could reduce corruption</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1">Food security</a> – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.</p>
<p>Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Food assistance</strong></p>
<p>Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/">prior studies</a> that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women</p></blockquote>
<p>Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing disparities</strong></p>
<p>This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.</p>
<p>Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ihd7XnvNt8g/">PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics</a></h4>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.</p>



<p>A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.</p>



<p>While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.</p>



<p>“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”</p>



<p>These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.</p>



<p>“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a></h4>

<p>One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/">report</a> by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.</p><p>The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.</p><p>This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”</p><p>A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards">criteria</a> for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths">myth</a> that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.</p><p>Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589">biologically-based disorders</a>, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">one study</a>, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.</p><p>We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">National Institutes of Health</a>, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm">tuberculosis</a>. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml">depression</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf">$69/person for schizophrenia</a> research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines">28 FDA-approved medications for depression</a> versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.</p><p>We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be. In that same <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">study</a> where we found that suicide was the leading cause of death, we found that an eating disorder was never listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Instead, we saw causes such as heart and liver failure in a 39-year-old woman who weighed less than half what a woman her age and height should weigh – less than half. In the absence of universal screening, we lose our best opportunity to prevent those deaths.</p><blockquote><p>We need to recognize eating disorders as serious mental illnesses that pose a threat to the health of our nation.</p><p>We need better health care coverage.</p><p>We need more funding for research.</p><p>We need universal screening.</p></blockquote><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><em>by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yGUuMIqjIrU">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633090054/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a></h4>

<p>A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600">investigated</a> which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21<sup>st</sup>-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.</p><p>The World Economic Forum’s <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">Future of Jobs Report 2018</a></em> took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.</p><p>These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">AP Computer Science Principles</a>. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.</p><p>The College Board <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles">announced</a> that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.</p><p>A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail">article</a> in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.</p><p>Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project">announced</a> that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.</p><p>A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf">approximately 30%</a> of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.</p><p>Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.</p><p><em>Featured Image credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/">Image</a> by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/" rel="nofollow">It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.</p><p>First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.<strong> </strong>Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/">Family Based Therapy</a>, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext">treatment approach of choice</a> for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.</p><p>Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.<strong> </strong>Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.<strong> </strong>The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.</p><p>Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/">negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors</a>. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/">body neutral is the place to aim</a>.<strong> </strong></p><p>Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It <em>is</em> important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is <em>not </em>their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.</p><p>Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm"><em>Image</em></a><em> by prostooleh via Freepik</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/" rel="nofollow">Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us</a></li></ul> </div>

Does the reward system in academia steer researchers away from investigating issues important to their community? These ECRs say yes.

<p>During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.</p>
<p>Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.</p>
<p>So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to deal with loneliness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness</p></blockquote>
<p>If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.</p>
