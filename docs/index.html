<img alt="nature-1242617_960_720" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/nature-1242617_960_720-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Walking through a spider web in the woods or sweeping out the silk from the corners of your house may seem like a pesky nuisance, but these tenacious webs are engineering feats. The majority of the cobweb, the frame of the orb-web, and the nearly invisible spider lifeline are all made of one type of spider silk that can have tensile strength rivaling steel. This is the major ampullate silk, named after the specialized abdominal gland in which it is synthesized. In terms of toughness, or the total amount of energy required to break, major ampullate silk outperforms steel and Kevlar. Consequently, it has been a prime target for human applications, with some textiles <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/in-the-future-well-all-wear-spider-silk?mbid=nl_170313_Daily&amp;CNDID=29472763&amp;spMailingID=10610432&amp;spUserID=MTMzMTgyOTk4NzI0S0&amp;spJobID=1121040554&amp;spReportId=MTEyMTA0MDU1NAS2">near production</a>.</p>
<p>Even more remarkable is that spiders do not produce just one silk type, unlike the silk moth caterpillars whose cocoons we use to make silk cloth. Instead, an orb-web weaving garden spider or cobweb weaver like the black widow make at least seven types of silk in as many morphologically distinct silk glands.</p>

<p>The material properties of each of these silks appear to be <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/13/2452">tailored to their ecological functions</a>. For instance, spiders cover their eggs with tubuliform silk, which in garden spiders is stiffer than any other silk type. Egg sacs are thus resistant to pressure that could crush the eggs. The aciniform silk used to wrap prey by garden spiders is the toughest of its silk types, withstanding the energy output of a struggling insect.</p>
<p>Orb-web weaving spiders use minor ampullate silks as temporary capture spirals, which are not as strong as draglines but are equally tough due to their higher stretchiness. Alternatively, black widow spiders use minor ampullate silk to wrap prey, but material properties from this species were previously unknown. My colleagues and I predicted that black widow and other cobweb weaver minor ampullate silks would have divergent material properties from orb-web weavers in part due to their varying functions. We further predicted that the DNA sequences of the genes encoding the minor ampullate silk proteins would differ between orb-web and cobweb weaving spiders.</p>
<p><strong>Sequencing spider silk genes in undergraduate courses</strong></p>
<p>Each type of spider silk is primarily made of one or more unique proteins that are collectively called spidroins (spider fibrous proteins). Spidroins and insect silk proteins share the property of being long (typically &gt;2000 amino acids) and repetitive (short sequences of amino acids could repeat 10-100s of times). Spidroins are thus notoriously difficult to completely sequence.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I have been using a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563967/pdf/mss254.pdf">combination of approaches</a> to characterize spidroins. Undergraduate students started helping me collect these data when I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, Riverside in Cheryl Hayashi’s lab. When I took a tenure-track job at Washington and Lee University I decided to scale up undergraduate involvement.</p>
<p>Each year in my Genetics Lab, 17-24 students tackle a new spider species. For our research on minor ampullate silks, <a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0927-x">recently published in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em></a>, encoding gene sequences were characterized by three different cohorts. Three students continued working with me in the summers and ultimately became the first three authors on our publication.</p>

<p><strong>Variation in minor ampullate silk proteins correlates with variation in silk properties</strong></p>
<p>After years of sequencing spider silk genes, we discovered unexpected diversity of minor ampullate silk proteins. Not only did orb-web weaver sequences differ from cobweb weavers’, dramatic differences were also found among cobweb weavers. Even more surprising was that each species’ genome included multiple genes encoding minor ampullate silk proteins, and these sequences were often strikingly different.</p>
<p>As an example, the brown widow (invasive in the United States), has one minor ampullate gene that encodes a protein only 815 amino acids long and includes “motifs” typical for minor ampullate proteins: e.g. glycine-alanine repeats. Another brown widow gene encodes a minor ampullate protein more than double the size of the first (1791 amino acids) that is riddled with glycine-proline-glycine. Proline tends to make a kink in proteins. Thus many glycine-proline-glycine iterations form spring-like spirals, which should make the protein elastic.</p>
<p>The false black widow’s minor ampullate proteins were the most proline-rich. Their minor ampullate silks were correspondingly twice as extensible as the minor ampullate silks of the black and brown widow. Overall, cobweb weaver minor ampullate silks were more extensible, but not as strong as orb-web weaver silks.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging cobweb prey wrapping proteins for human applications</strong></p>
<p>Our sequencing methods resulted in minor ampullate-encoding genes isolated in a format that would facilitate expression of pure protein. Our work could thus contribute to efforts to spin artificial fibers with custom-made properties. For instance, the proline-containing brown widow minor ampullate spidroin could be used to make extensible fibers incorporated into artificial tendons or <a href="http://www.livescience.com/1094-spider-silk-repair-human-ligaments.html">ligaments</a>. The longer alanine-rich black widow proteins may make stiffer fibers.</p>

<p>Most of us have a sense of what it means to be human. Research shows that we agree with each other that traits like friendly, jealous or impatient are more “human” than others like unemotional or selfless. What’s more, we like to see ourselves as human: we care more about human traits and claim to possess them more than other people. In other words, we “self-humanise”, laying claim to the good <em>and</em> the bad as long as they emphasise our own humanity.</p>
<p>But this research on self-humanising presents a conundrum. A different, abundant line of evidence shows that humans bitterly protect a highly positive self-image, supported by cognitive biases that attribute our own failings to <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias">circumstances</a> and other people’s to their <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_attribution_bias">deficiencies</a>. So, do we really overestimate the bad in ourselves, claiming to be more human, warts and all? According to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2017.1282849">a critique</a> of the self-humanising field in <em>The Journal of Social Psychology</em>, this is an oversimplification: when it comes to undesirable human traits, we see ourselves as pretty similar to other people.</p>
<p><span id="more-21177"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, led by Marzena Cypryańska of SWPS University Warsaw, conducted their work with 250 students from universities in Poland, Korea, and Italy. The participants – mostly in their twenties and fairly gender-balanced – rated themselves on 40 different traits relative to other students. Some traits like Sympathetic and Jealous were strongly associated with human nature, others like Selfless and Unemotional were not.</p>
<p>Most previous self-humanising research has compared scores in two different categories, for example finding that people give themselves significantly higher self-ratings than others for negative human traits, but not for non-human negative traits. But Cypryańska’s team pointed out that this approach is problematic because of the kind of rating scales that have been used. Imagine a participant rates themselves on a “human” trait like Jealous using the scale below:</p>
<p><img alt="self-humanising scale" class=" wp-image-21182 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="21182" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="self-humanising scale" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;h=109?w=361" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;h=109?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;h=109" data-orig-size="361,82" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/21/more-human-than-thou-or-just-better-our-motivation-to-think-were-good-trumps-our-desire-to-feel-human/self-humanising-scale/" height="109" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;h=109" width="480" /></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only a score above 4 would suggest that a participant truly believes they are “more Jealous than” others. However, the way that past research has worked, if a participant gave themselves a 3 on a negative human trait, this would be taken as a significantly higher self-rating than a 2 on a non-human negative trait. But the problem is that feeling “less” strongly that you have less of a trait than others is not the same as believing that you have “more” of it. Cypryańska and her colleagues point out that in their data, participants’ mean self-ratings of their negative traits – both human in nature and otherwise – were <em>never</em> significantly higher than 4.</p>
<p>What’s more, Cypryańska and her team revisited previous work that has reported statistically significant self-humanising for negative human traits using similar rating methods, and the same pattern emerged: that is, participants rarely claimed to have more of negative human traits, they were just less bold in their claims to have less of them. So the evidence doesn’t show people are so motivated to appear human that they happily endorse ugly parts of their human nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, participants did often rate themselves above the scale midpoint for positive traits, both human nature traits and other positive ones. Rather than proving we associate ourselves with human vices and virtues, these findings can be explained with the well-established <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-14648-005">Better Than Average</a> effect, where we associate ourselves more with positive attributes, less with negative ones.</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the self-humanising research body responds to this critique of their methods. Cypryańska’s group are not opposed to the idea that human traits are treated a little differently; perhaps we distance ourselves from our weaknesses, but with less fervour when they stem from a common human heritage. More research would be needed to unpick this. But according to this study, the ways we see ourselves as special have a pecking order. Good first, human later.</p>

<p>By now, most of our readers are aware that some fields of science have a reproducibility problem. Part of the problem, some argue, is the publishing community’s bias toward dramatic findings — namely, studies that show something has an effect on something else are more likely to be published than studies that don’t. Many have […]</p>

<p>Most people who undertake psychotherapy seem to benefit from it. How do we know? Arguably, the most important evidence comes from meta-analyses that combine the results from many – sometimes hundreds – of randomly controlled trials. Based on this, it’s been estimated that psychotherapy is effective for about 80 per cent of people (meanwhile, between five to 10 per cent of clients <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-1/when-therapy-causes-harm">may suffer adverse effects</a>).</p>
<p>But now the more concerning news: a team of researchers led by Evangelos Evangelou at the University of Ioannina, Greece has assessed the quality of 247 of these psychotherapy meta-analyses and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acps.12713/full">they report</a> in <em>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</em> that many of them have serious methodological short-comings.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a separate research group led by Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign has <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616302410">just published</a> in <em>Journal of Personality</em> some of the first observational data on how people’s personalities change after undertaking psychotherapy. In contrast to what’s been found <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/">in the clinical literature</a>, they report that people who’ve been in therapy seem to show negative changes in personality and other psychological outcomes.</p>
<p><span id="more-21028"></span></p>
<p>In their “umbrella review” of the psychotherapy literature, Evangelou and his team chose to include published meta-analyses covering any form of psychotherapy and almost any kind of target mental health condition, but with the proviso that each meta-analysis had itself combined the results from a minimum of ten studies. Their comprehensive search resulted in 247 unique meta-analyses which collectively synthesised data from over five thousand randomly controlled trials.</p>
<p>Overall, 80 per cent of the published psychotherapy meta-analyses had reported a significant and positive benefit of whatever form of psychotherapy was their focus. This sounds impressive at first, but after applying “state-of-the-art” tests of their robustness, Evangelou and his colleagues report that just 16 of the 247 meta-analyses had provided “convincing evidence”.</p>
<p>The researchers identified a number of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many meta-analyses showed a statistically significant amount of heterogeneity between the trials that they’d combined. The worry is that too many meta-analyses are comparing apples and oranges, although there is scholarly debate about what level of heterogeneity is unacceptable.</li>
<li>The researchers found many instances of the “small study bias”, which is the tendency for smaller, less robust studies to report larger effects.</li>
<li>They found evidence of “<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1740774507079441?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed">excess significance bias</a>“, which is when an over-abundance of trials seem to report positive findings given what we know so far about psychotherapy’s effectiveness. This suggests negative findings are remaining unpublished for whatever reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evangelou and his team conclude that the field of psychotherapy research needs to work harder to ensure that negative results are published as well as good news results, especially given <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/concerning-study-says-psychotherapy-research-has-a-problem-with-undeclared-researcher-bias/">the findings of another recent paper</a> suggesting that the field has a problem with undeclared researcher allegiance to particular therapeutic approaches. One way round this is to ensure all trials and meta-analyses are preregistered before they are conducted, alongside information on the statistical tests that are planned.</p>
<p>For the reader undertaking psychotherapy or who knows someone who is, it is worth keeping some perspective: this is just one critique and the weight of evidence still suggests that psychotherapy is, more often than not, beneficial.</p>
<p>For scholars, the methodological concerns raised by this new paper feed into an already contentious field. Some experts believe that, high-quality or not, randomly controlled trials (and by extension, meta-analyses based on those trials) are not really an appropriate way to gauge the effectiveness of psychotherapy because of all complex, myriad factors involved in the dynamic between a client and his or her therapist.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to look at observational data. Rather than signing people up to a controlled trial, with all the contrivances that that entails (such as standardising the delivery of therapy as much as possible), this approach is less hands-on and involves looking instead at the outcomes of people who happen to have been in therapy and those who haven’t.</p>
<p>Brent Roberts and his colleagues found two sources of this kind of data: hundreds of students in Tübingen who were enrolled in a long-term personality study and who’d completed measures twice across four years; and a group of thousands of older Americans who similarly had completed personality and other measures twice across four years.</p>
<p>Crucially, both these longitudinal surveys included a question about whether the participants had undertaken psychotherapy in the intervening period between the two data collection points. One hundred and twenty-eight of the Tübingen students had completed some therapy and, compared to the other students, they showed negative changes in their personality in terms of higher scores in neuroticism, less extraversion and conscientiousness, as well as reductions in self-esteem, increases in depression, and less life satisfaction. It was a similar story for the older American adults who’d been in therapy: they showed negative changes in personality and other psychological outcomes.</p>
<p>There are problems with how to interpret these findings – an obvious shortcoming of observational data of this kind is that it’s less controlled than an experimental trial. For example, perhaps undertaking therapy was a consequence of these unwelcome psychological changes rather than the cause (although this still wouldn’t explain why the therapy hadn’t been more helpful, more often). Whatever the explanation, however, the results <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/">stand in contrast to the findings from controlled psychotherapy trials</a> which have pointed overwhelming to positive personality changes arising from therapy. As Roberts and his team conclude, “the gravity of the issue necessitates that researchers investigate the apparent discrepancy between these findings and those from well-controlled trials”.</p>

It’s a night active moth and it’s been in the news lately as an invasive species in Africa that causes severe damage to corn and other crops, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38859851">threatens the livelihoods of farmers</a> and may <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/southern-africas-food-crops-under-threat-from-fall-armyworm-invasion">strip southern Africa of key food sources</a>. The fall armyworm (<em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>) originates from the Americas, where e.g. Brazil spends <a href="http://www.herald.co.zw/fao-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-in-fight-against-fall-armyworm/">over 600 million dollars every year</a> to control the pest.</p>
<p>While we need to figure out how to control the crop pest in Africa, there are some important things we can already learn from the moth. One of the central questions in biology is: where does all the biodiversity come from?</p>
<p>The fall armyworm can help us answer this question, as this species occurs as two different strains, called corn-strain and rice-strain. The strains look exactly alike, but differ in some features, like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456344">pheromone</a> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089255">composition</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eea.12215/abstract">host plant preference</a>, but most importantly <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01759.x/abstract;jsessionid=85B84C3A8F56A14D4DCFF7F3FCB8EDD3.f04t04">in their timing of mating</a>: the corn-strain mates early in the night, while the rice strain mates late in the night. How did we find these differences?</p>
<p>We observed hundreds of couples in a dark room, lit by a red light and a red flashlight, as moths can’t see red light. After the lights went off and night set in, the corn-strain moths became active, soon followed by matings. Meanwhile, the rice-strain moths were sitting still, motionless. Only after several hours, the rice-strain moths woke up and started their mating activities.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8725" style="width: 2570px;"><img alt="Female adult moth extruding her pheromone gland, advertising her availability for mating" class="size-full wp-image-8725" height="1920" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-2.jpg" width="2560" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Female adult moth extruding her pheromone gland, advertising her availability for mating</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Sabine Hänniger</div></figure>
<p>When two populations (or strains) of the same species don’t mate with each other, genes are not exchanged between these populations. Mutations that occur spontaneously are thus not exchanged and stay within the population, so that different mutations can accumulate in each population. In this way, two populations will become more and more genetically different over time, which can result in the development into two species.</p>
<p>Looking at the strains in our dark room that were either mating early or late, we wanted to know what genetic differences had accumulated between the two strains that could explain their differences in mating times at night. Therefore, we hybridized the two strains and observed the mating activities of the parental strains together with the hybrids and their offspring throughout the night with our red flashlights.</p>

<p>We then analyzed all those individuals genetically, and by combining the observation and genetic data, we could identify one chromosome that explained most of the timing difference between the strains. We were excited when we also found out that this chromosome harbors a gene that is part of the circadian clock: <em>vrille</em>!</p>
<p>Thus, the circadian rhythm of the corn-strain and the rice-strain appear to be out of sync and we identified <em>vrille</em> as a candidate to cause the asynchrony. When comparing the DNA sequence of this gene between the strains, we found some interesting differences in the promoter region.</p>
<p>The circadian clock is an internal molecular clock present in most living beings on earth. Dependent on light input, genes and proteins interact with each other in a circadian rhythm that is roughly 24 hours. This rhythm helps mice, for example, to wake up and get active at night when they can’t easily be seen by predators, and it helps the fall armyworm to wake up at the right time to find a mating partner.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8727" style="width: 2570px;"><img alt="Adult moths mating." class="size-full wp-image-8727" height="1920" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-3.jpg" width="2560" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Adult moths mating.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Sabine Hänniger</div></figure>
<p>We also looked at differences in the mRNA levels at every hour for 24 hours and found that <em>vrille</em> is always more expressed in the rice-strain than in the corn-strain. This made us curious about how this difference influences the other genes of the circadian clock. Excitingly, we did find some differences in expression levels of the genes that directly interact with vrille in the circadian clock.</p>
<p>In short, we may have identified a mechanism underlying evolution in progress between two strains that seem to become two different species. A change in the promoter region of the gene <em>vrille</em> may cause a change in the transcription of the gene, which can influence the circadian clock. An altered circadian clock alters the behavior of the fall armyworm, causing the different strains to mate at different time points at night. This timing difference constitutes a mating barrier that keeps the strains apart and may facilitate the development into different species.</p>
<p>Thus, in addition to being a severe pest that needs to be eradicated, the fall armyworm has given us insights in the evolutionary process of speciation, which has led to the great biodiversity on earth.</p>

If you want more than the TL;DR, please read <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a> and <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html">Part II</a>. Otherwise, the story so far can be quickly summarised as follows: we got our Oracle Express database installed and set up by adding the required users; we then built the ODB libraries and installed the ODB compiler. </p> <p>After this rather grand build up, we shall finally get to look at Dogen - just about. It now seems clear these series will have to be extended by at least one or two additional instalments in order to provide a vaguely sensible treatment of the material I had initially planned to cover. I wasn't expecting N to become so large, but - like every good software project - I'm now realising you can only estimate the size of the series properly once you've actually finished it. And to rub salt into the wounds, before we can proceed we must start by addressing some of the instructions in the previous posts which were <i>not quite right</i>. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Est Humanum Errare?</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>The first and foremost point in the <i>errata</i> agenda is concerned with the additional Oracle packages we downloaded in <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a>. When I had originally checked my Oracle XE install, I did not find an <code>include</code>directory, which led me to conclude that a separate download was required for driver libraries and header files. I did find this state of affairs somewhat unusual - but then again, it is Oracle we're talking about here, so "unusual" is the default behaviour. As it turns out, I was wrong; the header files are indeed part of the Oracle XE install, just placed under a rather… shall we say, <i>creative</i>, location: <code>/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/rdbms/public</code>. The libraries are there too, under the slightly more conventionally named <code>lib</code> directory. </p> <p>This is quite an important find because the downloaded OCI driver has moved on to v12 whereas XE is still on v11. There is backwards compatibility, of course - and everything should work fine connecting a v12 client against an v11 database - but it does introduce an extra layer of complexity: you now need to make sure you do not simultaneously have both v11 and v12 shared objects in the path when linking and running or else you will start to get some strange warnings. As usual, we try our best to confuse only one issue at a time, so we need to make sure we are making use of v11 and purge all references to v12; this entails recompiling ODB's oracle support. </p> <p>If you followed the instructions on <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html">Part II</a> and you have already installed the ODB Oracle library, you'll need to remove it first: </p> <pre class="example"><br />rm /full/path/to/local/lib/libodb-oracle* /full/path/to/local/include/odb/oracle<br /></pre> <p>Remember to replace <code>/full/path/to/local</code> with the path to your local directory. Then, you can build by following the instructions as per previous post, but with <b>one crucial difference</b> at configure time: point to the Oracle XE directories instead of the external OCI driver directories: </p> <pre class="example"><br />. /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh<br />LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib CPPFLAGS="-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/rdbms/public" LDFLAGS="-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib" ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br /></pre> <p>Again, replacing the paths accordingly. If all goes well, the end result should be an ODB Oracle library that uses the OCI driver from Oracle XE. You then just need to make sure you have executed <code>oracle_env.sh</code> before running your binary, but don't worry too much because I'll remind you later on. Whilst we're on the subject of Oracle packages, it's worth mentioning that I did a minor update to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a>: you didn't need to download SQLPlus separately either, as it is also included in XE package. So, in conclusion, after a lot of faffing, it turns out you can get away with just downloading XE and nothing else. </p> <p>The other minor alteration to what was laid out on the original posts is that I removed the need for the <code>basic</code> database schema. In truth, the entities placed in that schema were not adding a lot of value; their use cases are already covered by the <code>northwind</code> schema, so I removed the need for two schemas and collapsed them into one. </p> <p>A final note - not quite an <i>errata per se</i> but still, something worthwhile mentioning. We didn't do a "proper" Oracle setup, so when you reboot your box you will find that the service is no longer running. You can easily restart it from the shell, logged in as root: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># cd /etc/init.d/<br /># ./oracle-xe start<br />Starting oracle-xe (via systemctl): oracle-xe.service.<br /></pre> <p>Notice that Debian is actually clever enough to integrate the Oracle scripts with systemd, so you can use the usual tools to find out more about this service: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># systemctl status oracle-xe<br />● oracle-xe.service - SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking care of<br />   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/oracle-xe; generated; vendor preset: enabled)<br />   Active: active (exited) since Sun 2017-03-12 15:10:47 GMT; 6s ago<br />     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)<br />  Process: 16761 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/oracle-xe start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)<br /><br />Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz systemd[1]: Starting SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking c…e of...<br />Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz oracle-xe[16761]: Starting Oracle Net Listener.<br />Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: Successful su for oracle by root<br />Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: + ??? root:oracle<br />Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user oracle by (uid=0)<br />Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz oracle-xe[16761]: Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance.<br />Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: Successful su for oracle by root<br />Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: + ??? root:oracle<br />Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user oracle by (uid=0)<br />Mar 12 15:10:47 lorenz systemd[1]: Started SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking care of.<br />Hint: Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full.<br /></pre> <p>With all of this said, lets resume from where we left off. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Installing the Remaining Packages</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>We still have a number of packages to install, but fortunately the installation steps are easy enough so we'll cover them quickly in this section. Let's start with Dogen. </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-2-1"><h3 id="sec-2-1">Dogen</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1"><p>Installing Dogen is fairly straightforward: we can just grab the latest release from BinTray: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><a href="https://dl.bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen/0.99.0/dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb">dogen 0.99.0 amd64-applications.deb</a></li></ul> <p>As it happens, we must install v99 or above because we did a number of fixes to Dogen as a result of this series of articles; previous releases had shortcomings with their ODB support. </p> <p>As expected, the setup is pretty standard-fare debian: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ wget https://dl.bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen/0.99.0/dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb -O dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb<br />$ sudo dpkg -i dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb<br />[sudo] password for USER:<br />Selecting previously unselected package dogen-applications.<br />(Reading database ... 551550 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb ...<br />Unpacking dogen-applications (0.99.0) ...<br />Setting up dogen-applications (0.99.0) ...<br /></pre> <p>If all has gone according to plan, you should see something along the lines of: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ dogen.knitter --version<br />Dogen Knitter v0.99.0<br />Copyright (C) 2015-2017 Domain Driven Consulting Plc.<br />Copyright (C) 2012-2015 Marco Craveiro.<br />License: GPLv3 - GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;.<br /></pre></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-2-2"><h3 id="sec-2-2">Dia</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2"><p>Dogen has multiple frontends - at the time of writing, JSON and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/">Dia</a>. We'll stick with Dia because of its visual nature, but keep in mind that what you can do with Dia you can also do with JSON. </p> <p>A quick word on Dia for those not in the know, copied <i>verbatim</i> from its home page: </p> <blockquote><p>Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program for GNU/Linux, MacOS X, Unix, and Windows, and is released under the GPL license. </p> <p>Dia is roughly inspired by the commercial Windows program 'Visio,' though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use. It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and many other diagrams. </p></blockquote> <p>Dia does not change very often, which means any old version will do. You should be able to install dia straight off of package manager: </p> <pre class="example"><br />apt-get install dia<br /></pre></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-2-3"><h3 id="sec-2-3">Other Dependencies</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3"><p>I had previously assumed Boost to be installed on <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html">Part II</a> but - if nothing else, purely for the sake of completeness - here are the instructions to set it up, as well as CMake and Ninja. We will need these in order to build our application, but we won't dwell on them <i>too</i> much on them or else this series of posts would go on forever. Pretty much any recent version of Boost and CMake will do, so again we'll just stick to vanilla package manager: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># apt-get install cmake ninja-build libboost-all-dev<br /></pre> <p>Mind you, you don't <i>actually</i> need the entirety of Boost for this exercise, but it's just easier this way. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-2-4"><h3 id="sec-2-4">Emacs and SQL Plus</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4"><p>Finally, a couple of lose notes which I might as well add here. If you wish to use SQLPlus from within Emacs - and you should, since the <a href="http://dbspecialists.com/an-introduction-to-emacs-sqli-mode/">SQLi mode</a> is just simply glorious - you can configure it to use our Oracle Express database quite easily: </p> <pre class="example"><br />(add-to-list 'exec-path "/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin")<br />(setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin"))<br />(setenv "ORACLE_HOME" "/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe")<br /></pre> <p>After this you will be able to start SQL Plus from Emacs with the usual <code>sql-oracle</code> command. I recommend you to do at least a minimal setup of SQL Plus too, to make it usable: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; set linesize 8192<br />SQL&gt; set pagesize 50000<br /></pre></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Introducing Zango</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>After this excruciatingly long setup process, we can at <i>long last</i>start to create our very "simple" project. Simple in quotes because it ended up being a tad more complex than what was originally envisioned, so it was easier to create a <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/zango">GitHub repository</a> for it. It would have been preferable to describe it from first principles, but then the commentary would literally go on for ever. A compromise had to be made. </p> <p>In order to follow the remainder of this post please clone <code>zango</code>from GitHub: </p> <pre class="example"><br />git clone git@github.com:DomainDrivenConsulting/zango.git<br /></pre> <p>Zango is a very small Dogen project that builds with CMake. Here are some notes on the folder structure to help you navigate: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><code>build/cmake</code>: additional CMake modules that are not part of the standard CMake distribution. We need this for ODB, Oracle and Dogen. </li><li><code>data</code>: some application data that we will use to populate our database. </li><li><code>projects</code>: where all the code lives. </li><li><code>projects/input_models</code>: location of the Dogen models - in this case, we just have one. You could, of course, place it anywhere you'd like, but traditionally this is where they live. </li><li><code>projects/northwind</code>: code output of the Dogen model. This is the key project of <code>zango</code>. </li><li><code>projects/application</code>: our little command line driver for the application. </li></ul> <p>Now, before we get to look at the code I'd like to first talk about Northwind and on the relationship between Dogen and ODB. </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-3-1"><h3 id="sec-3-1">Northwind Schema</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1"><p>Microsoft makes the venerable Northwind database available in CodePlex, at <a href="https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/">this</a> location. I found a useful description of the Northwind database <a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind.html">here</a>, which I quote: </p> <blockquote><p>Northwind Traders Access database is a sample database that shipped with Microsoft Office suite. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called Northwind Traders, which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. You can use and experiment with Access with Northwind database while you're learning and develop ideas for Access. </p></blockquote> <p>If you <i>really</i> want a thorough introduction to Northwind, you could do worse than reading this paper: <a href="http://eduglopedia.org/resource/cea008e18dee42899aeff7a0c58dddaf8e9b5bc6/download">Adapting the Access Northwind Database to Support a Database Course</a>. Having said that, for the purposes of this series we don't really need to dig <i>that</i> deep. In fact, I'll just present CodePlex's diagram with the tables and their relationships to give you an idea of the schema - without any further commentary - and that's more or less all that needs to be said about it: </p> <img height="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/Northwind_A4_size_for_Print.png" width="80%" /><div>Northwind Schema (C) Microsoft.</div> <p>Now, <i>in theory</i>, we could use this image to manually extract all the required information to create a Dia diagram that follows Dogen's conventions, code-generate that and Bob's your Uncle. However, <i>in practice</i> we have a problem: the CodePlex project only contains <a href="https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/releases/view/71634">the SQL statements for Microsoft SQL Server</a>. Part of the point of this exercise is to show that we can load real data from Oracle, rather than just generate random data, so it would be nice to load up the "real" Northwind data from their own tables. This would be more of an "end-to-end" test, as opposed to using ODB to generate the tables, and Dogen to generate random data which we can push to the database. </p> <p>However, its not entirely trivial to convert T-SQL into Oracle SQL, and since this is supposed to be a "quick" project on the side - focusing on ODB and Dogen - I was keen on not spending time on unrelated activities such as SQL conversions. Fortunately, I found exactly what I was looking for: a series of posts from <a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/">GeeksEngine</a>entitled "Convert MS Access Northwind database to Oracle". For reference, these are as follows: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle.html">How the data types in Access Northwind are converted to Oracle</a></li><li><a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle-2.html">Building Oracle Northwind database objects</a></li><li><a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle-3.html">Queries to generate aggregated data for Oracle Northwind database</a></li></ul> <p>If you don't care too much about the details, you can just look at the Oracle SQL statements, available <a href="http://www.geeksengine.com/lg.php?i=oracle-northwind-sql">here</a> and copied across into the Zango project. I guess it's still worthwhile mentioning that GeeksEngine has reduced considerably the number of entities in the schema - for which they provide a rationale. Before we start an in-depth discussions into the merits of normalisation and de-normalisation and other DBA level topics, I have to stop you in your tracks. Please do not get too hung-up on the "quality" of the database schema of Northwind - either the Microsoft or the GeeksEngine one. The purpose of this exercise is merely to demonstrate how Dogen and ODB work together to provide an ORM solution. From this perspective, any vaguely realistic database schema is adequate - provided it allows us to test-drive all the features we're interested in. Whether you agree or not with the decisions the original creators of this schema made is a completely different matter, which is well beyond the scope of this series of posts. </p> <p>Right, so now we need to setup our Northwind schema and populate it with data. For this you can open a SQL Plus session with user Northwind as explained previously and then run in the SQL script: </p> <pre class="example"><br />@/path/to/zango/data/Oracle-Northwind.sql<br /></pre> <p>Replacing <code>/path/to</code> with the full path to your Zango checkout. This executes the GeeksEngine script against your local Oracle XE database. If all has gone well, you should now have a whole load of tables and data. You can sanity-check the setup by running the following SQL: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; select table_name from all_tables where owner = 'NORTHWIND';<br /><br />TABLE_NAME<br />------------------------------<br />ORDER_DETAILS<br />CATEGORIES<br />CUSTOMERS<br />EMPLOYEES<br />SUPPLIERS<br />SHIPPERS<br />PRODUCTS<br />ORDERS<br /><br />8 rows selected.<br /><br />SQL&gt; select employee_id, firstname, lastname from employees where rownum &lt;3;<br /><br />EMPLOYEE_ID FIRSTNAME  LASTNAME<br />----------- ---------- --------------------<br />      1 Nancy      Davolio<br />      2 Andrew     Fuller<br /></pre> <p>Now then, let's model these entities in Dogen. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-3-2"><h3 id="sec-3-2">The Dogen Model for Northwind</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2"><p>Before we proceed, I'm afraid I must make yet another disclaimer: a proper explanation on how to use Dia (and UML in general) is outside the scope of these articles, so you'll see me hand-waving quite a lot. Hopefully the diagrams are sufficiently self-explanatory for you to get the idea. </p> <p>The process of modeling is simply to take the entities of the GeeksEngine SQL schema and to model them in Dia, following Dogen's conventions: each SQL type is converted to what we deemed to be the closest C++ type. You can open the diagram from the folder <code>projects/input_models/northwind.dia</code>, but if you haven't got it handy, here's a screenshot of most of the UML model: </p> <img height="90%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/dia_with_northwind.png" width="90%" /><div>Dogen Northwind model.</div> <p>The first point of note in that diagram is - if you pardon the pun - the UML note. </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="odb_uml_note.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_uml_note.png" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> UML Note from northwind model.</p></div> <p>This configuration is quite important so we'll discuss it a bit more detail. All lines starting with <code>#DOGEN</code> are an extension mechanism used to supply meta-data into Dogen. First, lets have a very quick look at the model's more "general settings": </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><code>yarn.dia.comment</code>: this is a special command that tells Dogen to use this UML note as the source code comments for the namespace of the model (i.e. <code>northwind</code>). Thus the text "The Northwind model is a…" will become part of a doxygen comment for the namespace. </li><li><code>yarn.dia.external_modules</code>: this places all types into the top-level namespace <code>northwind</code>. </li><li><code>yarn.input_language</code>: the notation for types used in this model is C++. We won't delve on this too much, but just keep in mind that Dogen supports both C++ and C#. </li><li><code>quilt.cpp.enabled</code>: as we are using C++, we must enable it. </li><li><code>quilt.cpp.hash.enabled</code>: we not require this feature for the purposes of this exercise. </li><li><code>quilt.csharp.enabled</code>: As this is a C++-only model, we will disable C#. </li><li><code>annotations.profile</code>: Do not worry too much about this knob, it just sets a lot of default options for this project such as copyright notices and so forth. </li></ul> <p>As promised, you won't fail to notice we hand-waved quite a lot on the description of these settings. It is very difficult to explain them properly them without giving the reader an immense amount of context about Dogen. This, of course, needs to be done - particularly since we haven't really spent the required time updating the manual. However, in the interest of keeping this series of posts somewhat focused on ODB and ORM, we'll just leave it at that, with a promise to create Dogen-specific posts on them. </p> <p>Talking about ORM, the next batch of settings is exactly related to that. </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><code>yarn.orm.database_system</code>: here, we're stating that we're interested in both <code>oracle</code> and <code>postgresql</code> databases. </li><li><code>yarn.orm.letter_case</code>: this sets the "case" to use for all identifiers; either <code>upper_case</code> or <code>lower_case</code>. So if you choose <code>upper_case</code>, all your table names will be in upper case and vice-versa. This applies to all columns and object names on the entirety of this model (e.g. <code>customers</code> becomes <code>CUSTOMERS</code> and so forth). </li><li><code>yarn.orm.schema_name</code>: finally we set the schema name to <code>northwind</code>. Remember that we are in upper case, so the name becomes <code>NORTHWIND</code>. </li></ul> <p>In addition to the meta-data, the second point worth noticing is that there is a large overlap between C++ classes and the entities in the original diagram. For example, we have <code>customers</code>, <code>suppliers</code>, <code>employees</code> and so forth - the Object-Relational Mapping is very "linear". This is a characteristic of the Dogen approach to ORM, but you do not necessarily need to use ODB in this manner; we discuss this in the next section. </p> <p>If one is to look at a properties of a few attributes in more detail, one can see additional Dogen meta-data. Take <code>customer_id</code> in the <code>customers</code> class: </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="odb_customer_id_attributes.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_customer_id_attributes.png" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Properties of customer<sub>id</sub> in the customer class.</p></div> <p>The setting <code>yarn.orm.is_primary_key</code> tells Dogen that this attribute is the primary key of the table. Note that we did not use an <code>int</code> as the type of <code>customer_id</code> but instead made use of a Dogen feature called "primitives". Primitives are simple wrappers around builtins and "core" types such as <code>std::string</code>, intended to have little or no overhead after the compiler is done with them. They are useful when you want to use domain concepts to clarify intent. For example, primitives help making it obvious when you try to use a <code>customer_id</code>when a <code>supplier_id</code> was called for. It's also worth noticing that <code>customer_id</code> makes use of <code>yarn.orm.is_nullable</code> - settable to <code>true</code>or <code>false</code>. It results in Dogen telling ODB if a column can be <code>NULL</code>or not. </p> <p>As we stated, each of the attributes of these classes has the closest C++ type we could find that maps to the SQL type used in the database schema. Of course, different developers can make different choices for these types. For example, were we to store the picture data rather than a path to the picture as GeeksEngine decided to do, we would use a <code>std::vector&lt;char&gt;</code> instead of a <code>std::string</code>. In that case, we'd have to perform some additional mapping too: </p> <pre class="example"><br />#DOGEN yarn.orm.type_override=postgresql,BYTEA<br />#DOGEN yarn.orm.type_override=oracle,BLOB<br /></pre> <p>This tells Dogen about the mapping of the attribute's type to the SQL type. Dogen then conveys this information to ODB. </p> <p>Dogen's ORM support is still quite young - literally a couple of sprints old - so there will be cases where you may need to perform some customisation which is not yet available in its meta-model. In these cases, you can bypass Dogen and make use of ODB pragmas directly. As an example, GeeksEngine Oracle schema named a few columns in <code>Employees</code> without underscores such as <code>FIRSTNAME</code> and <code>LASTNAME</code>. We want the C++ classes to have the correct names (e.g. <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, etc) so we simply tell ODB that these columns have different names in the database. Take last name for example: </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="odb_last_name_attributes.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_last_name_attributes.png" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span> Properties of last name in the employee class.</p></div> <p>A final note on composite keys. Predictably, Dogen follows the ODB approach - in that primary keys that have more than one column must be expressed as a class on its own right. In <code>northwind</code>, we use the postfix <code>_key</code> for these class names in order to make them easier to identify - e.g. <code>order_details_key</code>. You won't fail to notice that this class has the flag <code>yarn.orm.is_value</code> set. It tells Dogen - and, by extension, ODB - that it is not really a full-blown type, which would map it to a table, but instead should be treated like other value types such as <code>std::string</code>. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-3-3"><h3 id="sec-3-3">Interlude: Dogen with ODB vs Plain ODB</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3"><p>"The technical minutiae is all well and good", the inquisitive reader will say, "but why Dogen <i>and</i> ODB? Why add yet another layer of indirection when one can just use ODB?" Indeed, it may be puzzling for there to be a need for a code-generator which generates code for another code-generator. "Turtles all the way down" and "We over-engineered it yet again", the crowd chants from the terraces. </p> <p>Let me attempt to address some of these concerns. </p> <p>First, it is important to understand the argument we're trying to make here: Dogen models benefit greatly from ODB, but its not necessarily the case that <i>all</i> ODB users benefit from Dogen. Let's start with a classic ODB use case, which is to take an existing code base and add ORM support to it. In this scenario it makes no sense to introduce Dogen; after all, ODB requires only small changes to the original source code and has the ability to parse very complex C++. And, of course, using ODB in this manner also allows one to deal with impedance mismatches between the relational model and the object model of your domain. </p> <p>Dogen, on the other hand, exists mainly to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_software_development">Model Driven Software Development</a> (MDSD), so the modeling process is the driver. This means that one is expected to start with a Dogen model, and to use the traditional MDSD techniques for the management of the life-cycle of your model - and eventually for the generation of <i>entire software product lines</i>. Of course, you need not buy into the whole MDSD sales pitch in order to make use of Dogen, but you should at least understand it in this context. At a bare minimum, it requires you to think in terms of Domain Models - as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Development</a>defines them - and then in terms of "classes of features" required by the elements of your domain. These we call "facets" in Dogen parlance. There are many such facets like <code>io</code>, which is the ability to dump an object's state into a C++ stream - at present using JSON notation - or <code>serialization</code> which is the ability to serialise an object using Boost serialisation. It is in this context that ODB enters the Dogen world. We could, of course, generate ORM mappings (and SQL) directly from Dogen. But given what we've seen from ODB, it seems this would be a very large project - or, conversely, we'd have very poor support, not dealing with a great number of corner cases. By generating the very minimal and very non-intrusive code that ODB needs, we benefit from the years of experience accumulated in this tool whilst at the same time making life easier for Dogen users. </p> <p>Of course, as with all engineering trade-offs, this one is not without its disadvantages. When things do go wrong you now have more moving parts to go through when root-causing: was it an error in the diagram, or was it Dogen, or was it the mapping between Dogen and ODB or was it ODB?  Fortunately, I found that this situation is minimised by the way in which you end up using Dogen. For instance, all generated code can be version-controlled, so you can look at the ODB input files generated by Dogen and observe how they change with changes in the Dogen model. The Dogen ODB files should also look very much like regular hand-crafted ODB files - making use of <code>pragmas</code> and so forth - and you are also required to run ODB manually against them. Thus, in practice, I have found troubleshooting straightforward enough that the layers of indirection end up not constituting a real problem. </p> <p>Finally, its worth pointing out that the Domain Models Dogen generates have a fairly straightforward shape to them, making the ODB mapping a lot more trivial that "general" C++ code would have. It is because of this that we have <code>orm</code> parameters in Dogen, which can expand to multiple ODB pragmas - the user should not need to worry about that expansion. </p></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-4"><h2 id="sec-4">Conclusion</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"><p>This part is already becoming quite large, so I'm afraid we need to stop it here and continue on Part IV. However, we have managed to address a few of the mistakes of the Oracle setup of previous parts, introduced the remaining applications that we need to install and then discussed Northwind - both in terms of its original intent and also in terms of the Dogen objectives. Finally we provided an explanation of how Dogen and ODB fit together in a tooling ecosystem. </p></div></div></div><div class="status" id="postamble"><p class="date">Created: 2017-03-19 Sun 23:07</p><p class="creator"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> 25.1.1 (<a href="http://orgmode.org">Org</a> mode 8.2.10)</p><p class="validation"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">Validate</a></p></div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/lJI9NLVUis4/">A Sincere Thank You from PLOS</a></h4>

<img alt="Thank-you-640x320" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/Thank-you-640x320-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>2017 marks the third year that PLOS formally acknowledges our community of reviewers and editors with a public thank you published as a citable journal article. We do this to honor the dedicated service and substantial contributions made by working scientists – scientists with day jobs – who graciously provide their time and expertise to our organization. Thank you journal articles provide reviewers and editors the academic citation and recognition for their valuable service to colleagues, institutions, funders and the public.</p>
<p>It takes a global network of more than 78,000 reviewers and 7,000 editors to ensure that articles, perspectives, editorials and more achieve the highest quality possible. The more than 12 million article views per month (on average) this past year shows that PLOS reviewers and editors are up to the task of vetting the science, the ethics, the reporting guidelines and journal publication criteria presented in the more than 27,000 research articles published in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>For the first time we are including in each of the seven journals’ thank you articles the number of newly submitted and published research articles brought to the public in 2016. We are confident that this data, in real terms, supports our ongoing commitment to increased transparency surrounding the publishing process.</strong></p>
<p>We are also confident that readers will appreciate the workload required of reviewers and editors to support these publication numbers. In addition, contributors to <em>PLOS Biology</em> were tasked with fine-tuning Aperta™, our new submission system, as they reviewed, discussed and moved submissions through the publication process.</p>
<p>As they shepherd papers and provide feedback so authors may improve manuscripts and refine experimental work, it is more than quality that our contributor community champions. Reviewers, Editors and Editorial Board members who choose to do so also communicate the mission of Open Access, the value of Open Data and the relevance of Open Science to society at large.</p>
<h4>These individuals serve as ambassadors not just for PLOS but for all of science. Public access to rigorous peer-reviewed research, the role of journals in communicating the work of our communities and the enthusiasm of our own staff are all sustained by this extensive pool of inspired and dedicated scientists.</h4>
<p>To all of our Reviewers, Academic Editors, Guest Editors and Editorial Board members, thank you! Those wanting to explore deeper will find every reviewer’s and editor’s name in the Supporting Information of each journal’s published article; links to these articles are below.</p>

<p>The human brain contains approximately 60 billion cerebellar granule cells, which outnumber all other brain neurons combined. Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21726">doi: 10.1038/nature21726</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/_o_IrLjJIGU" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/4L_QZ9jdkQI/nature21679">Ancient evolutionary origin of vertebrate enteric neurons from trunk-derived neural crest</a></h4>

<p>
 The enteric nervous system of jawed vertebrates arises primarily from vagal neural crest cells that migrate to the foregut and subsequently colonize and innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Here we examine development of the enteric nervous system in the basal jawless vertebrate the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to gain insight into its evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for the existence of a vagally derived enteric neural crest population in the lamprey. Rather, labelling with the lipophilic dye DiI shows that late-migrating cells, originating from the trunk neural tube and associated with nerve fibres, differentiate into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole. We propose that these trunk-derived neural crest cells may be homologous to Schwann cell precursors, recently shown in mammalian embryos to populate post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia, including enteric ganglia. Our results suggest that neural-crest-derived Schwann cell precursors made an important contribution to the ancient enteric nervous system of early jawless vertebrates, a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest cells in early gnathostomes.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/qRvuaLHKn7c/nature21676">Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer</a></h4>

<p>
 A significant fraction of patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy experience relapse with relentless progression to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Immune checkpoint blockade using antibodies against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) or programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PD-L1) generates durable therapeutic responses in a significant subset of patients across a variety of cancer types. However, mCRPC showed overwhelming de novo resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, motivating a search for targeted therapies that overcome this resistance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to play important roles in tumour immune evasion. The abundance of circulating MDSCs correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels and metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. Mouse models of prostate cancer show that MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+) promote tumour initiation and progression. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that robust immunotherapy responses in mCRPC may be elicited by the combined actions of immune checkpoint blockade agents together with targeted agents that neutralize MDSCs yet preserve T-cell function. Here we develop a novel chimaeric mouse model of mCRPC to efficiently test combination therapies in an autochthonous setting. Combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 engendered only modest efficacy. Targeted therapy against mCRPC-infiltrating MDSCs, using multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and BEZ235, also showed minimal anti-tumour activities. Strikingly, primary and metastatic CRPC showed robust synergistic responses when immune checkpoint blockade was combined with MDSC-targeted therapy. Mechanistically, combination therapy efficacy stemmed from the upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and suppression of MDSC-promoting cytokines secreted by prostate cancer cells. These observations illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining immune checkpoint blockade with MDSC-targeted therapies in the treatment of mCRPC.

The authors were attempting to develop a method to produce large amounts of a high-quality two-dimensional form of antimonene, a prized crystal structure that has been notoriously difficult to synthesize reliably.

<img alt="Genetic code" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Genomic-research-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>‘Systems Medicine’ is a multidisciplinary field focused on unravelling, computing and integrating physiological and biochemical data, with the mission to develop a specially tailored system of information. As computer-based approaches become increasingly pervasive, not just in developed countries, but worldwide, the need to take physician-centred and patient-centred approaches in the design and development of this field becomes ever more important.</p>
<p>For roughly 50 years now, researchers and practitioners in computational and biomedical sciences have worked to formulate theory and practice that influences the direction of these approaches, and this diverse work makes up the field of Systems Medicine [1, 2]. Broadly speaking, it includes the study of what technology might be able to do for physicians and patients and how both parties might interact with this technology.</p>
<p>Several Good Practices are already in place, such as: the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), the E-Cell, as well as established educational curricula such as the MS Degree program in Georgetown University, USA and networking and society efforts, such as the European Association for Systems Medicine (EASyM) [3, 4, 5, 6]. This collection on ‘‘Systems Medicine’’ constitutes a significant milestone on an idea that stretches back through the vision posed by Allanson and Fairclough’s ‘‘A research agenda for physiological computing’’ [7].</p>
<p>The body of work planned in the thematic series is to provide a platform for a systemic approach, which avoids reductionism and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, immunological, gastrointestinal, etc.) [7, 8]. The results of any experiment require interpretation, especially when the data relate to systems as complex as living organisms. To be meaningful, the data has to fit within the family of ideas, principles or paradigms recognized by the field [9]. Biomedical data is most easily interpretable, for example, when it fits the expectations of a practicing physician, e.g. cardiologist; data that doesn’t fit these expectations often gets ignored [10]. Therefore, a computational reframing and establishment of good simulation practices, similar to the good clinical practices, will benefit medicine as a whole, if it allows physicians to incorporate into the field heretofore -unexpected or ill-fitting observations.</p>
<p>The novel character of computation in systems medicine seems to nurture the imagination and foster ingenuity. It is exhilarating to witness the inventiveness which is abundant in the biomedical computing field and the meaningful application of analysis tools that are being brought to bear on the fascinating challenges of the blend of medicine with computers.</p>
<p>These editors’ writings have already helped me to get my bearings amid the concepts of digital health, orienting my perspective on even my own work. I look forward to furthering that educational process with the present volume.</p>
<p>We would hence welcome submissions of original research articles (including systematic reviews and meta-analyses), but also methodology, software and database articles. This collection in <em><a href="http://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Systems Biology</a></em> will also include invited reviews.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission of manuscripts is 15th December 2017.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Racism and prejudice are sometimes blatant, but often manifest in subtle ways. The current emblem of these subtle slights is the “microaggression”, a concept that has generated a large programme of research and launched itself into the popular consciousness – prompting last month’s decision by Merriam-Webster <a href="http://https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/microaggression-words-were-watching">to add it to their dictionary</a>. However, a new review in <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em> by Scott Lilienfeld of Emory University argues that core empirical and conceptual questions about microaggressions remain unaddressed, meaning the struggle against them takes place on a confusing battlefield, one where it’s hard to tell between friend and foe.</p>
<p><span id="more-20999"></span></p>
<p>So what exactly is a microaggression? First coined in the 1970s but rejuvenated in 2007 in a paper in the <em>American Psychologist</em> by Derald Wing Sue and colleagues, it originally referred only to racism but has expanded to a range of commonplace slights or hostility towards an oppressed group. The definition includes <em>microinvalidations</em>, such as being told that a negative interaction couldn’t have been due to racist motives, and <em>microinsults</em>, such as a teacher avoiding calling on you in class due to your gender, as well as a third class of <em>microassaults</em>. The prototypical microaggression hides the offence within apparently innocent words or actions, which places those on the receiving end into a catch-22: swallow the indignity, or respond and risk being accused of overreaction?</p>
<p>This seems coherent on its face, but Lilienfeld argues there is an elastic nature to the definition, for example allowing Sue to assert that “the fact that psychological research has continued to inadequately address race and ethnicity…is in itself a microaggression.” In addition, items filed as microassaults include racial slurs and swastika graffiti; Lilienfeld argues that there is nothing micro about these events, so including them alongside the other examples muddies the waters and could spuriously make microaggressions appear culpable for harm, when the responsible party was old-fashioned abuse.</p>
<p>It’s not just that the edges of microaggression are poorly defined: ambiguity is baked into the entire concept. Advocates see this as a key feature, and claim that more ambiguous acts of prejudice are the most damaging, because they are the hardest to deal with – that aforementioned catch-22. (Sue again: “The invisibility of racial microaggressions may be more harmful to people of color than hate crimes or the covert and deliberate acts of White supremacists such as the Klan and Skinheads.”) Ambiguity can have its uses but the risk is that the concept becomes overly subjective.</p>
<p>For example, it could be that the experience of microaggressions is at least partially explained by a propensity to see fault or attack in statements. It could also be that the apparent impact of microaggressions on health or wellbeing is because people prone to negative emotionality (they score high on the trait of neuroticism) are more likely both to perceive microaggressions and to experience poorer health. One study did find an effect of microaggressions on negative moods and physical symptoms even after controlling for trait neuroticism, but the personality scale used in this study didn’t include any items related to proneness to feeling victimised, which seems an oversight.</p>
<p>Personality having a hand in microaggression experience would also explain why some people from minority groups report no microaggressions when canvassed. The (limited) evidence that more ambiguous slights lead to more negative outcomes could also reflect the established psychological fact that in “weak” situations with no clear guidelines for action, people’s personality – in this case, their negative emotionality – tends to assert itself to fill in the interpretive gaps.</p>
<p>Lilienfeld raises a lot of other issues we simply don’t have space for here: political assumptions, no measurement of base rates of everyday slights, inclusion criteria that limits participants to those who already buy into the concept to begin with, and the need to address whether people who commit microaggressions show other signs of a prejudicial mindset (something that research into the Implicit Affect test <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html"><u>has also struggled to demonstrate</u></a>). But he stresses that while he is not here to praise research into microaggression, nor is he here to bury it. He emphasises that many of these issues could be addressed by joining the microaggression field more closely with other more established areas of psychological research, and he offers a number of steps researchers could take to strengthen their research base.</p>
<p>Lilienfeld also suggests we all consider putting aside the word microaggression in favour of “perceived racial slight” – because we don’t yet understand the role of interpretation due to personality, and because it simply isn’t clear that those using microaggressions are showing aggression as we usually understand the word. Putting aside the charged term, together with the “victim and perpetrator” parlance used by advocates and researchers, would allow us to affirm that these ambiguous events have a reality of their own, while recognising that the nature of that reality needs further investigation to be understood.</p>

<img alt="Grouper fig 1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-fig-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Fishing for a unique behaviour</strong></p>
<p>How well do we understand fish behaviour? Many fish species, in many habitats, have been extensively studied. Yet with the increasing impact of fishing and other human activities on the marine environment, we can question how much natural behaviour that would be observed in pristine environments has vanished from the areas we are actually able to study.</p>
<p>Take fish mating behaviour. The classic pattern is of male and female fish gathering at spawning grounds, females releasing their eggs directly into the water, and males releasing their sperm to fertilise these eggs. Beyond these basic behaviours however, fish utilise a huge range of mating strategies, with individuals within a single species flexibly using different tactics depending on the situation and their own status.</p>
<p>How fish behave during mating will often depend on the density at which they gather at spawning grounds, with some mating tactics only seen when a considerable number of females have aggregated. Given how increasingly rare pristine spawning grounds are – especially for large, commercially fished species – we have to question how much mating behaviour we never see because these exploited species are never able to gather in sufficiently large numbers.</p>
<p>This makes research conducted on spawning aggregations in un-fished areas – if they can still be found – especially valuable, providing a critical opportunity to observe baseline behavior and determine what impact overfishing is having on natural mating practices.</p>
<p>This is what the authors of an article <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0120-5">recently published in <em>BMC Ecology</em></a> were able to achieve. The researchers, led by <a href="http://ncf-india.org/people/rucha-karkarey">Rucha Karkarey at the Nature Conservation Foundation in India</a>, studied the squaretail grouper; a common species on coral reefs across the Indo-Pacific, very well studied, but heavily exploited by fisheries. With considerable effort, the researchers located an un-fished, pristine spawning ground and observed new mating behaviors never seen before.</p>

<p><strong>An Island Eden</strong></p>
<p>The research was conducted on Bitra, one of the most remote islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago, itself located a remote 400km south-west of the Indian coast. Bitra is a tiny island, home to just over 200 people, but crucially is surrounded by a substantial coral reef. Traditionally, local fishing has only been an artisanal enterprise, so the researchers hoped there was a good chance Bitra could be the place to observe an ‘untouched’ spawning aggregation of the squaretail grouper.</p>
<p>Working on such a remote island was not without its challenges. The logistics of travelling to such a remote place and the difficulties of surveying the reefs meant it was several years before the researchers determined when the squaretail grouper gather to spawn.</p>
<p>Across the Indo-Pacific region, grouper spawn on the day of either the new moon or the full moon, depending on location and species. After several years of opportunistic surveys, and much questioning of local fishermen, the researchers determined that the new moon in January was when squaretailed groupers would gather in the largest numbers.</p>
<p>Armed with this intelligence, the researchers set out to survey the reefs during the new moon of January in 2013 and 2014, hoping to see behavior never observed before.</p>
<p><strong>A moonless rendezvous </strong></p>
<p>Male grouper arrived at the spawning site up to three days before the new moon in order to establish territories. Females, easily distinguishable from males by their distended bellies, arrived the day prior to the new moon in large schools of 150-200 fish. After their arrival, the researchers surveyed the breeding ground through snorkelling and scuba diving, observing and videoing mating behaviours. As they had hoped, the grouper aggregation was substantial, containing the highest densities ever recorded for this species.</p>
<p>Males made their territories on two types of habitat, either the slope of the reef or the reef shelf. Large males were much more common on the slope, with smaller males more likely to make their territories on the shelf; given the fierce competition between males to establish and defend territories, this implies that the reef slope provides the best mating grounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the majority of females gathered on the slope, where fish density was approx. six times higher than on the shelf.</p>
<p>Yet unexpectedly, larger females seemed to prefer searching for mates among the smaller males on the reef shelf. Meanwhile, larger males on the slope were observed preferentially courting smaller females even when larger females were present. Among fish generally, it is common – and intuitive – for larger males to prefer larger females (who can produce more eggs) and vice versa. The inverse size-assortment seen in these large aggregations of grouper is a unique behaviour never seen before.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just who the fish chose to mate with that surprised the researchers; <em>how</em> they mated was unusual as well. The ‘classic’ squaretail grouper mating behaviour, commonly observed in other locations, is pair spawning. Here, a female will break away from her larger school and visit a male’s territory. The male courts her by approaching with a quivering motion, followed by a display of the underside of his body. If she’s impressed, the pair will release their eggs and sperm in a ‘spawning rush’ just above the male’s territory.</p>
<p>In the large mating aggregations on the reefs around Bitra, the researchers also observed a second, never before seen, mating behaviour which they term ‘school-courtship’. Here, males made regular forays into the water above their territories, courting multiple females in a school before rapidly returning to their territory. This is distinct to the usual pair spawning in that it took place outside the male’s territory and involved a single male mating simultaneously with multiple females.</p>
<p>Use of the school-courtship strategy was very dependent on the size of a male and the location of its territory; only larger males with territories on the reef slope were observed using this novel tactic. For these males the tactic was highly successful, as they associated with three times more females than males using pair-courtship tactics. It came with a cost though; these males spent almost quadruple the time engaging in aggressive behaviour with other males to defend their territories. This newly discovered mating behavior seems to be very much a high-risk-high-reward tactic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The above video shows an example of the unique school-spawning behavior. In the foreground, a male guards his territory in ‘traditional’ style. To the left, in the background, another male can be seen leaving his territory to make a foray into the school of females above. The male is seen courting multiple females in the school, followed by a sudden upward spawning rush between the male and 4–5 females from the school, proceeded by a release of gametes.</p>
<p><strong>Paradise lost?</strong></p>
<p>And now the sting to this tale. During the course of their investigations, the researchers noted that a nascent but troubling commercial fishing industry had appeared on the reefs around Bitra. While not specifically targeting grouper, such an increase in fishing pressure clearly presents a threat to their breeding aggregations.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the researcher’s most recent data from 2015 and 2016 found an alarming 50% decline in peak aggregation compared to 2013 levels. Surveying the breeding schools in 2016 they were unable to observe a single instance of the novel school courtship behaviour. Is this unique behaviour to become extinct almost as soon as we have learnt of it?</p>
<p>Beyond the specific case of the squaretail grouper, these findings raise a wider concern about the perils of overfishing. Even if commercially exploited species are able to survive with sustainable populations (a big if for many species) we may still be eliminating unique and important behaviors that can only exist when fish are able to gather in large densities.</p>
<p>This could have potentially substantial effects on these species. In the squaretail grouper, the novel school-courtship behaviour is only used by the ‘best’ males (i.e. the largest individuals, able to obtain the best territories) and potentially substantially increases their mating success. This suggests that its elimination in overfished populations could have significant effects on the future demographics and evolution of the species. Even aside from this, isn’t there something tragic about seeing such unique and fascinating behaviour, the product of countless years of evolution, disappear from our oceans?</p>
<p>There is hope for the Bitra squaretail grouper. The researchers have <a href="http://ncf-india.org/projects/aggregating-groupers">presented their findings</a> to the local community and sought their support in protecting the grouper. The response has been positive, with many even expressing a local pride that their island hosts an apparently unique natural phenomenon. With the cooperation of the Lakshadweep Fisheries Department and Administration they are attempting to establish a reserve that will ban commercial fishing in the grouper breeding areas in the few days around the January new moon. If these efforts are successful then perhaps the squaretail grouper will continue to display the full variety of their natural behaviour in at least one part of our vast oceans.</p>

<img alt="Cocaine" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/03/Cocaine-1-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Cocaine is a common illicit drug of abuse which is able to strongly modify the brain. Cocaine-induced synaptic modifications are implicated in the neuronal adaptations underling addiction. Cocaine is able to increase the synaptic contents of dopamine (the “feel-good” chemical), by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) which is in charge for the synaptic re-uptake of the neurotransmitter. This massive increase in dopamine produces euphoria and pleasure. Despite several decades of efforts, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for cocaine-induced neuronal maladaptations are far from being completely understood and unveiled.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/6/1395.full.pdf">PNAS article</a>, the laboratory of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2000/greengard-bio.html">Paul Greengard</a> (Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000) has revealed for the first time how a protein called WAVE1 is able to regulate the brain’s response to cocaine. Indeed, these results provide novel insights into the molecular functioning of the “addicted brain” and could lead to better interventions for treating addiction to cocaine and other drugs.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>“<em>We knew about the connection between WAVE1 and dopamine many years ago, but until now no one knew the mechanisms by which cocaine stimulates WAVE1 and how WAVE1 regulates cocaine’s actions</em>” says Yong Kim, a Research Assistant Professor in Greengard’s lab and the senior author of the new study.</p>
<p>In particular, the authors showed that WAVE1 was necessary to induce the rewarding and psychomotor effects of cocaine administration by knocking-down WAVE1 in the dopaminoceptive neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region highly involved in reward and motivation. However, it must be noted that the neurons of the NAc are not all the same. In fact, the nucleus accumbens is mainly composed of medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) which can be further subdivided depending on the expression of the dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) or the dopamine receptor 2 (D2R). We can then distinguish D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs. Surprisingly, cocaine-induced behavioral alterations were strongly reduced only when WAVE1 was genetically ablated in D1R-MSNs. However, this effect was not observed when WAVE1 was removed from cells containing the D2R, thus revealing new details about the neurobiological mechanisms of cocaine. In addition, the authors observed that WAVE1 phosphorylation was modulated by dopamine through its dopamine D1R receptor since pharmacological blockade of this specific receptor was able to block cocaine-induced WAVE1 post-translational modifications.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this study also provides new evidence regarding the functional role of WAVE1 at the level of the brain’s synapses, the tiny junctions between neuronal cells through which impulses pass. The authors observed that WAVE1 activation is associated with morphological and functional decreases in excitatory synapses on specific D1R-MSNs. Importantly, “<em>certain polymorphisms in WAVE1 complex proteins in humans might contribute to vulnerability in functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses underlying addiction behavior such as cocaine craving and relapse</em>”, say Ilaria Ceglia, the leading author of the study. Altogether the results suggest that this protein may play a critical role in providing a regulatory negative feedback at the level of specific excitatory synapses as a part of the cellular and molecular maladaptations induced by cocaine.</p>
<p>“<em>It’s well known that cocaine increases the signaling of dopamine in the brain</em>” Kim says. “<em>Understanding more about the mechanism of cocaine action is providing new insights into the neurobiology of addiction. Our eventual goal is to use these findings to find a way to develop a drug to treat addiction</em>”, conclude the authors.</p>
<p>Further studies will obviously be required to deeply understand all the molecular actors responsible for the psychostimulant effects induced by cocaine.</p>

<p>In this session, I will discuss dynamic report generation using <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> (Sweave). <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> is an R package that enables R code integration into various markup languages such as LaTeX, HTML, Markdown etc. It can be used for writing research papers, theses, or even producing web-pages for presenting results. <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> is valuable in scientific circles for several reasons. Beside allowing reports to be flexible and modified automatically, <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> makes reproducible research simpler than manual approaches. When used properly, <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> describes the steps of an experiment explicitly, and these steps are self-documented (by using R code). <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> itself is not complicated, however it does require some knowledge of the R language.</p>
<p>This session will be divided in two parts. In first part I will give a brief background to <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a>. I will use second part of the talk to demonstrate several examples on how to use <a class="reference external" href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">Knitr</a> to make a (dynamic) research paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-i-definitions-and-the-data-driven-approach/">Computational neuroscience</a> is the science of how the brain “computes”, that is, how the brain performs cognitive functions such as recognizing a face or walking. Here I will argue that most models of cognition developed in the field, especially as regards sensory systems, are actually not biological models but hybrid models consisting of a neural model together with an abstract model.</p>
<p>First of all, many neural models are not meant to be models of cognition. For example, there are models that are developed to explain the irregular spiking of cortical neurons, or oscillations. I will not consider them. According to the definition above, I categorize them in theoretical neuroscience rather than computational neuroscience. Here I consider for example models of perception, memory, motor control.</p>
<p>An example that I know well is the problem of localizing a sound source from timing cues. There are a number of models, including a spiking neuron model that we have developed (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000993">Goodman and Brette, 2010</a>). This model takes as input two sound waves, corresponding to the two monaural sounds produced by the sound source, and outputs the estimated direction of the source. But the neural model, of course, does not output a direction. Rather, the output of the neural model is the activity of a layer of neurons. In the model, we consider that direction is encoded by the identity of the maximally active neuron. In another popular model in the field, direction is encoded by the relative total activity of two groups of neurons (see our comparison of models in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/2/e01312">Goodman et al. 2013</a>). In all models, there is a final step which maps the activity of neurons to estimated sound location, and this step is not a neural model but an abstract model. This causes big epistemological problems when it comes to assessing and comparing the empirical value of models because a crucial part of the models is not physiological. Some argue that neurons are tuned to sound location; others that population activity varies systematically with sound location. Both are right, and thus none of these observations is a decisive argument to discriminate between the models.</p>
<p>The same is seen in other sensory modalities. The output is the identity of a face; or of an odor; etc. The symmetrical situation occurs in motor control models: this time the abstract model is on the side of the input (mapping from spatial position to neural activity or neural input). Memory models face this situation twice, with abstract models both on the input (the thing to be memorized) and the output (the recall).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, this situation has to do with the fact that <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xviii-representational-approaches-in-computational-neuroscience/">most models in computational neuroscience take a representational approach</a>: they describe how neural networks represent in their firing some aspect of the external world. The representational approach requires defining a mapping (called the “decoder”) from neural activity to objective properties of objects, and this mapping cannot be part of the neural model. Indeed, sound location is a property of objects and thus does not belong to the domain of neural activity. So no sound localization model can ever be purely neuronal.</p>
<p>Thus to develop biological models, it is necessary to discard the representational approach. Instead of “encoding” things, neurons control the body; neurons are agents (rather than painters in the representational approach). For example, a model of sound localization should be a model of an orientational response, including the motor command. The model explains not how space is “represented”, but how an animal orients its head (for example) to a sound source. When we try to model an actual behavior, we find that the nature of the problem changes quite significantly. For example, because a particular behavior is an event, neural firing must also be seen as events. In this context, counting spikes and looking at the mutual information between the count and some stimulus property is not very meaningful. What matters is the events that the spikes trigger in the targets (muscles or other neurons). The goal is not to represent the sensory signals but to produce an appropriate behavior. One also realizes that the relation between sensory signals and actions is circular, and therefore <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xix-does-the-brain-process-information/">cannot be adequately described as “processing”</a>: sensory signals make you turn the head, but if you turn the head, the sensory signals change.</p>
<p>Currently, most models of cognition in computational neuroscience are not biological models. They include neuron models together with abstract models, a necessity stemming from the representational approach. To a make biological model requires including a model of the sensorimotor loop. I believe this is the path that the community should take.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/experience-blindness-echolocation-daniel-kish">Daniel Kish’s life</a> reads like the origins story out of a super hero comic book. To treat his cancer, doctors removed both Kish’s eyes when he was aged one. Later, as a child, he taught himself to echolocate like a bat. Using the echoes from his own clicking sounds he detects the world around him. He can even cycle busy streets and it’s his life’s mission to empower other blind children by teaching them echolocation or what he calls flashsonar.</p>
<p>Psychologists studying the skill have found that it is eminently teachable, for blind people and the sighted. But what’s also become clear is that there is a huge amount of variation between individuals: some people, blind or sighted, seem to pick it up easily while others struggle. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-016-4833-z?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">new study</a> in <em>Experimental Brain Research</em> is among the first to try to find out which mental abilities, if any, correlate with echolocation aptitude. The findings could help screening to see who is likely to benefit from echolocation and offer clues to how to help those who struggle.</p>
<p><span id="more-20880"></span></p>
<p>Marina Ekkel and her colleagues blindfolded 23 sighted undergrad participants and asked them to sit opposite a small acrylic disc and a large disc. One disc was always located higher than the other with the positions switched discreetly from trial to trial.  Each trial, the participants’ task was to identify the respective location of the discs.</p>
<p>The participants wore a small speaker on their foreheads and on each echolocation trial, to help them locate the discs, they could press a button to emit a short burst of white noise from this speaker as many times as they wanted for up to 20 seconds (on average, the participants chose to make 2.7 sounds). On control trials they had to locate the discs without making any sounds.</p>
<p>Although participants were allowed to move their heads (doing so makes echolocation much more effective), five participants chose to always kept their heads still and they never performed any better than if they’d just guessed at random, so their data was omitted from further study.</p>
<p>As well as performing four sessions of the echolocation tests for one to two hours over two days, the remaining participants also completed tests of their cognitive abilities including: their spatial cognition (based on their ability to remember the location of shapes on a plate); their working memory (recalling lists of digits); and their sustained and divided attention (they took the “Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task/PASAT”: presented with a series of 60 single-digit numbers, they had to add each new number to the preceding one and state the sum out loud).</p>
<p>Overall, the participants never performed better than chance in the control trials – they may as well have been guessing. In contrast, average correct performance across the echolocation trials was 63.2 per cent. There was also a clear training effect with performance in the fourth session clearly outstripping performance in the first. But consistent with past research, there were again large differences in individual aptitude: in the final sessions, the top performing participant managed 96 per cent accuracy versus 48 per cent achieved by the lowest performer.</p>
<p>Comparing participants’ echolocation improvement with their performance on the other cognitive tests, only their sustained and divided attentional abilities were relevant. The higher participants scored on the PASAT attentional test, the more improvement they showed in echolocation. This makes sense if you consider the concentration that must be involved in using echolocation effectively. By contrast, participants’ scores on spatial cognition and working memory did not correlate with their echolocation skills.</p>
<p>These results add to past research that’s shown people who lose their sight earlier in life tend to find it easier to learn echolocation, perhaps because they’ve had more practice using other senses to compensate for their lack of sight. The new findings suggest that attentional abilities are another key factor that’s relevant. Screening based on attentional skills might help identify those most likely to benefit from echolocation training, or perhaps honing attention skills could be a useful adjunct to training in echolocation. For now all this is highly speculative: the present results were correlational (it’s not necessarily the case that attentional skills are directly relevant), and among things, we need to see if the results replicate in blind participants.</p>

<img alt="Machine learning in the fight against cancer." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Genetic-data-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The complexity of cancer has famously eluded conquering by modern medicine. Every tumor has many aberrations that drive its growth. As a result, treatments that target single vulnerabilities are typically of short-lived efficacy. After being diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer in 2013, I wagered that what was needed was an algorithm capable of digesting and analyzing the complexity to provide a detailed view into the multitude of factors at work in a given tumor.</p>
<p>To pursue this goal, I began a collaboration with Greg Ver Steeg, who specializes in analyzing big data, to bring state-of-the-art machine learning to bear on the recently released large-scale data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA contains publicly available comprehensive maps of the key genomic changes in 33 types of cancer.</p>
<h3><strong>Finding patterns</strong></h3>
<p>Greg previously developed a machine learning method called Correlation Explanation (CorEx) which we applied to TCGA tumor data. CorEx uses information-theoretic principles to find hidden factors that ‘explain’ relationships in the data. In our case, these factors account for dependencies (correlations) among tumor genes.</p>
<p>During our initial discussions, it was clear that CorEx showed promise, but required refinement to squeeze as much information as possible out of noisy gene expression data. Subsequent innovations in this context allow CorEx to learn patterns efficiently from relatively small numbers of patient genomic profiles.</p>
<p>Greg and I used the improved CorEx to find patterns in RNA-seq gene expression data for 420 ovarian tumors. CorEx was able to find an extraordinary amount of structure in the data, much of which was associated with known cellular functions and pathways. We identified genes whose expression seems to be linked in ovarian cancer and with all these expression dependencies mapped out, we could begin to ask how they fit into a larger framework for understanding of tumor biology and treatment.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8684" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Figure 1: Tree representation of CorEx groups annotated with Gene Ontology terms" class="wp-image-8684 size-large" height="553" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/figure-1-1024x885.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1: Tree representation of CorEx groups annotated with Gene Ontology terms</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><strong>Towards targeted treatment</strong></p>
<p>One of the questions we asked was how to combine treatments in order to extend patient survival. We were able to show that combinations of the CorEx factors (i.e. patterns of gene expression that CorEx identified) were significantly associated with survival among the TCGA patients. This suggests a method for selecting combination therapies based on these patterns for future clinical trials.</p>
<p>We also asked whether any factors associate with long term survival (a particular concern for me!). One specific factor stood out as a candidate. It contained several proteins regulating stemness properties – such as the ability of cells to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types – that are implicated in aggressive metastatic disease and chemoresistance.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that tumors containing many cells with stemlike gene expression correlate with poor long-term patient survival. CorEx is especially good at detecting weak correlations in large sets of variables, and this is likely why it was able to detect this particular pattern for the first time in ovarian cancer expression data.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8685" style="width: 1489px;"><img alt="Difference in 5-year survival by score for combined CorEx factors containing shown protein networks" class="size-full wp-image-8685" height="827" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Figure-2.png" width="1479" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Difference in 5-year survival by score for combined CorEx factors containing shown protein networks</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>While these are interesting general highlights, the real significance of our findings lies in CoreEx’s capacity to identify multiple target networks in an individual tumor. When I recurred less than a year after completing my initial chemotherapy, I was able to compare my tumor’s gene expression to patterns of gene expression CorEx had identified in the TCGA data. I noticed that the expression factors present in my tumor suggested a very favorable immune activation. Generally, this would predict a favorable response to chemotherapy, but unfortunately that had not been the initial outcome.</p>
<p>I used this information from CorEx to select an unconventional second chemotherapy regimen including an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which allows immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.</p>
<p>Greg and my efforts have borne fruit: I am still alive and off therapy for 18+ months – a second remission that is at least twice as long as the first one, which is rare in recurrent ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>While we cannot be sure that the extended remission was due to my algorithm-driven treatment choices, what is certain is that some patients benefit greatly from personalized treatment options and there is a great need to expand this benefit to more patients.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the TCGA ovarian cancer RNA-seq presents a rich tableau of tumor biology, of which we have only scratched the surface. We expect deeper exploration of the various factors that drive individual tumor growth, spread and survival will yield further insights to inform more rational, targeted treatment selection. Although much further research is needed before this method can be widely applied, with an algorithm like CorEx that is capable of sorting out the daunting complexity of tumor cell biology, we are hopeful the tide will soon turn in more cancer patients’ favor.</p>

<p>
 During epithelial cytokinesis, the remodelling of adhesive cell–cell contacts between the dividing cell and its neighbours has profound roles in the integrity, arrangement and morphogenesis of proliferative tissues1–7. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, this remodelling requires the activity of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in the interphasic cells neighbouring the dividing cell1,3,5. However, the mechanisms coordinating cytokinesis and MyoII activity in the neighbours are unknown. Here we find that in the Drosophila notum epithelium, each cell division is associated with a mechano-sensing and transmission event controlling MyoII dynamics in the neighbours. We established that the ring pulling forces promote local junction elongation, resulting in local E-cadherin (E-Cad) dilution at the ingressing adherens junction (AJ). In turn, the reduction of E-Cad concentration and the contractility of the neighbouring cells promote self-organized actomyosin flows, ultimately leading to MyoII accumulation at the base of the ingressing AJ. While force transduction has been extensively studied in the context of AJ reinforcement to stabilize adhesive cell-cell contacts8, we propose an alternative mechano-sensing mechanism able to coordinate actomyosin dynamics between epithelial cells and to sustain AJ remodelling in response to mechanical forces.

<p>The persistence of the HIV reservoir in infected individuals is a major obstacle to the development of a cure for HIV. Here, using an in vitro model of HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells, we reveal a gene expression signature of 103 upregulated genes that are specific for latently infected cells, including genes for 16 transmembrane proteins. In vitro screening for surface expression in HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells shows that the low-affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, CD32a, is the most highly induced, with no detectable expression in bystander cells. Notably, productive HIV-1 infection of T-cell-receptor-stimulated CD4 T cells is not associated with CD32a expression, suggesting that a quiescence-dependent mechanism is required for its induction. Using blood samples from HIV-1-positive participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, we identify a subpopulation of 0.012% of CD4 T cells that express CD32a and host up to three copies of HIV DNA per cell. This CD32a+ reservoir was highly enriched in inducible replication-competent proviruses and can be predominant in some participants. Our discovery that CD32a+ lymphocytes represent the elusive HIV-1 reservoir may lead to insights that will facilitate the specific targeting and elimination of this reservoir.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21710">doi: 10.1038/nature21710</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/1UES02MC4s4" width="1" />

 Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline. A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed. However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages, in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250–1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations. These findings also support the idea that conservation interventions that increase floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season have positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.

<p>
 During 2015–2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

<p>
 The vertebrate-conserved RNA-binding protein DND1 is required for the survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs), as well as the suppression of germ cell tumours in mice. Here we show that in mice DND1 binds a UU(A/U) trinucleotide motif predominantly in the 3′ untranslated regions of mRNA, and destabilizes target mRNAs through direct recruitment of the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the extent of suppression is dependent on the number of DND1-binding sites. This DND1-dependent mRNA destabilization is required for the survival of mouse PGCs and spermatogonial stem cells by suppressing apoptosis. The spectrum of target RNAs includes positive regulators of apoptosis and inflammation, and modulators of signalling pathways that regulate stem-cell pluripotency, including the TGFβ superfamily, all of which are aberrantly elevated in DND1-deficient PGCs. We propose that the induction of the post-transcriptional suppressor DND1 synergizes with concurrent transcriptional changes to ensure precise developmental transitions during cellular differentiation and maintenance of the germ line.

<p>
 Maternally inherited 15q11-13 chromosomal triplications cause a frequent and highly penetrant type of autism linked to increased gene dosages of UBE3A, which encodes a ubiquitin ligase with transcriptional co-regulatory functions. Here, using in vivo mouse genetics, we show that increasing UBE3A in the nucleus downregulates the glutamatergic synapse organizer Cbln1, which is needed for sociability in mice. Epileptic seizures also repress Cbln1 and are found to expose sociability impairments in mice with asymptomatic increases in UBE3A. This Ube3a–seizure synergy maps to glutamate neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), where Cbln1 deletions impair sociability and weaken glutamatergic transmission. We provide preclinical evidence that viral-vector-based chemogenetic activation of, or restoration of Cbln1 in, VTA glutamatergic neurons reverses the sociability deficits induced by Ube3a and/or seizures. Our results suggest that gene and seizure interactions in VTA glutamatergic neurons impair sociability by downregulating Cbln1, a key node in the expanding protein interaction network of autism genes.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/MLcZGcP0gfE/nature21675">The true tempo of evolutionary radiation and decline revealed on the Hawaiian archipelago</a></h4>

<p>Establishing the relationship between rates of change in species richness and biotic and abiotic environmental change is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Although exquisite fossil and geological records provide insight in rare cases, most groups lack high-quality fossil records. Consequently, biologists typically rely on molecular phylogenies to study the diversity dynamics of clades, usually by correlating changes in diversification rate with environmental or trait shifts. However, inferences drawn from molecular phylogenies can be limited owing to the challenge of accounting for extinct species, making it difficult to accurately determine the underlying diversity dynamics that produce them. Here, using a geologically informed model of the relationship between changing island area and species richness for the Hawaiian archipelago, we infer the rates of species richness change for 14 endemic groups over their entire evolutionary histories without the need for fossil data, or molecular phylogenies. We find that these endemic clades underwent evolutionary radiations characterized by initially increasing rates of species accumulation, followed by slow-downs. In fact, for most groups on most islands, their time of evolutionary expansion has long past, and they are now undergoing previously unrecognized long-term evolutionary decline. Our results show how landscape dynamism can drive evolutionary dynamics over broad timescales, including driving species loss that is not readily detected using molecular phylogenies, or without a rich fossil record. We anticipate that examination of other clades where the relationship between environmental change and species richness change can be quantified will reveal that many other living groups have also experienced similarly complex evolutionary trajectories, including long-term and ongoing evolutionary decline.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21675">doi: 10.1038/nature21675</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/MLcZGcP0gfE" width="1" />

<p>
 Cell proliferation and survival require the faithful maintenance and propagation of genetic information, which are threatened by the ubiquitous sources of DNA damage present intracellularly and in the external environment. A system of DNA repair, called the DNA damage response, detects and repairs damaged DNA and prevents cell division until the repair is complete. Here we report that methylation at the 6 position of adenosine (m6A) in RNA is rapidly (within 2 min) and transiently induced at DNA damage sites in response to ultraviolet irradiation. This modification occurs on numerous poly(A)+ transcripts and is regulated by the methyltransferase METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) and the demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein). In the absence of METTL3 catalytic activity, cells showed delayed repair of ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine adducts and elevated sensitivity to ultraviolet, demonstrating the importance of m6A in the ultraviolet-responsive DNA damage response. Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the ultraviolet response, some of which resynthesize DNA after the lesion has been excised by the nucleotide excision repair pathway, while others participate in trans-lesion synthesis to allow replication past damaged lesions in S phase. DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ), which has been implicated in both nucleotide excision repair and trans-lesion synthesis, required the catalytic activity of METTL3 for immediate localization to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage sites. Importantly, Pol κ overexpression qualitatively suppressed the cyclobutane pyrimidine removal defect associated with METTL3 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a novel function for RNA m6A modification in the ultraviolet-induced DNA damage response, and our findings collectively support a model in which m6A RNA serves as a beacon for the selective, rapid recruitment of Pol κ to damage sites to facilitate repair and cell survival.

<p>
 Plants live in biogeochemically diverse soils with diverse microbiota. Plant organs associate intimately with a subset of these microbes, and the structure of the microbial community can be altered by soil nutrient content. Plant-associated microbes can compete with the plant and with each other for nutrients, but may also carry traits that increase the productivity of the plant. It is unknown how the plant immune system coordinates microbial recognition with nutritional cues during microbiome assembly. Here we establish that a genetic network controlling the phosphate stress response influences the structure of the root microbiome community, even under non-stress phosphate conditions. We define a molecular mechanism regulating coordination between nutrition and defence in the presence of a synthetic bacterial community. We further demonstrate that the master transcriptional regulators of phosphate stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana also directly repress defence, consistent with plant prioritization of nutritional stress over defence. Our work will further efforts to define and deploy useful microbes to enhance plant performance.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8xWnpep1UbQ/nature21415">Phytoplankton can actively diversify their migration strategy in response to turbulent cues</a></h4>

<p>
 Marine phytoplankton inhabit a dynamic environment where turbulence, together with nutrient and light availability, shapes species fitness, succession and selection. Many species of phytoplankton are motile and undertake diel vertical migrations to gain access to nutrient-rich deeper layers at night and well-lit surface waters during the day. Disruption of this migratory strategy by turbulence is considered to be an important cause of the succession between motile and non-motile species when conditions turn turbulent. However, this classical view neglects the possibility that motile species may actively respond to turbulent cues to avoid layers of strong turbulence. Here we report that phytoplankton, including raphidophytes and dinoflagellates, can actively diversify their migratory strategy in response to hydrodynamic cues characteristic of overturning by Kolmogorov-scale eddies. Upon experiencing repeated overturning with timescales and statistics representative of ocean turbulence, an upward-swimming population rapidly (5–60 min) splits into two subpopulations, one swimming upward and one swimming downward. Quantitative morphological analysis of the harmful-algal-bloom-forming raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo together with a model of cell mechanics revealed that this behaviour was accompanied by a modulation of the cells’ fore–aft asymmetry. The minute magnitude of the required modulation, sufficient to invert the preferential swimming direction of the cells, highlights the advanced level of control that phytoplankton can exert on their migratory behaviour. Together with observations of enhanced cellular stress after overturning and the typically deleterious effects of strong turbulence on motile phytoplankton, these results point to an active adaptation of H. akashiwo to increase the chance of evading turbulent layers by diversifying the direction of migration within the population, in a manner suggestive of evolutionary bet-hedging. This migratory behaviour relaxes the boundaries between the fluid dynamic niches of motile and non-motile phytoplankton, and highlights that rapid responses to hydrodynamic cues are important survival strategies for phytoplankton in the ocean.

<p>I have just uploaded a new chapter of my <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-book-on-the-theory-of-action-potentials/">book on the theory of action potentials</a>: <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/theory-of-action-potentials-chapter-4.pdf">Excitability of an isopotential membrane</a>. In this chapter, I look mostly at the concept of spike threshold: the different ways to define it, its quantitative relation to different biophysical parameters (eg properties of sodium channels), and the conditions for its existence (eg a sufficient number of channels). This is closely related to my previous work on the threshold equation (<a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850">Platkiewicz and Brette, 2010</a>). It also contains some unpublished work (in particular updates of the threshold equation).</p>
<p>I am planning to extend this chapter with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few Brian notebooks.</li>
<li>A section on excitability types (Hodgkin classification).</li>
<li>Some experimental confirmations of the threshold equation that are under way (you will see in section 4.4.2 that current published experimental data do not allow precise testing of the theory).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am now planning to work on the chapter on action potential propagation.</p>
<p>All comments are welcome.</p>

<p>Volunteer! Universities, community groups and even the NHS recommend it, citing benefits for society and also yourself. The claimed personal outcomes include <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/volunteering/Pages/Whyvolunteer.aspx">boosting your health and subjective wellbeing</a>, but while the former is slowly gathering experimental backing, the wellbeing research is overwhelmingly correlational, making it hard to prove that volunteering is causing the gains (it’s certainly plausible, for instance, that happier people are simply more inclined to give up their time for free). Now the journal <i>Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology</i> has published <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23743603.2016.1273647?journalCode=rrsp20">a more robust test</a>: a randomised study. The researchers looked for evidence to support the mental wellbeing benefits from volunteering … but they looked in vain.</p>
<p><span id="more-20855"></span></p>
<p>Ashley Whillans of the University of British Columbia led the study which investigated the impact of a popular American volunteering programme called Community Service Learning (CSL), in which university students earn study credits by volunteering for ten to twelve hours per week – for example, running a food bank, or mentoring younger students. The university participating in this study was frequently oversubscribed for its CSL programme and used a lottery to place students into the programme or onto a wait list, naturally creating experimental and control groups similar in background and motivation.</p>
<p>All participants reported their mental wellbeing before and after the two-semester long programme ran, using a measure covering life satisfaction, personal meaning, experienced emotions and depressive symptoms, as well as feelings of loneliness and social connectedness. Volunteers have tended to show high scores on all of these measures in past research, so Whillans’ team predicted they would find a moderate increase in these outcomes among the volunteers in their study. But comparing the 232 volunteers to the 56 wait list students, no such effect was found. There wasn’t even any evidence that volunteering might be having a beneficial effect on a specific subgroup of the volunteers.</p>
<p>The results seem to suggest that volunteering does little or nothing for wellbeing. But if true, this really would be surprising, given that volunteering encompasses activities and experiences that are known to make humans happier. Giving to others <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5831/1622">produces neural hedonic responses</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">reducing isolation is crucial to wellbeing</a>, and opportunities to practice mastery and autonomy are key components of human flourishing. The CSL programme should be an especially good example of beneficial volunteering as course credit depends on students reflecting on their participation and developing learning plans, linking the volunteering to their own personal development. So what gives?</p>
<p>One possibility is that volunteering can involve so many activities that it doesn’t make sense to try and investigate it as a whole. One volunteer might be offered autonomy and mastery of a new domain, another might end up in stifling conditions, and would have flourished more left to her own devices.</p>
<p>But the data hint at another explanation. The students investigated were, subjectively speaking, in a good place: only five per cent were at risk of depression, as compared to national student rates of closer to twenty per cent. All attended a good quality university that provides plenty of socialising, stimulation and opportunities for self-improvement. Without a deficit in these aspects of life, perhaps volunteering simply doesn’t have much additional to offer. This explanation is far from certain, but it does tally with <a href="http://https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/55/5/S308/536418/Differential-Benefits-of-Volunteering-Across-the">previous research</a> suggesting that those who benefit most from volunteering tend to be people from more vulnerable backgrounds with fewer opportunities to enhance their sense of meaning or self-image.</p>
<p>What to conclude? That well-adjusted, privileged people should avoid volunteering? Not at all. For the most advantaged, volunteering, and charity more generally, can be seen as a duty to pay something back into society and help it run smoothly, which in the long run benefits us all. But we shouldn’t make false claims about the psychological benefits. The right kind of volunteering might be a glorious experience; at other times it might feel more like a drudgery, compared to the alternatives. Don’t do it expecting immediate gratification. Do it because it’s the right thing to do.</p>
