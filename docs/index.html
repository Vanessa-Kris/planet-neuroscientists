Although many minority Yazidis celebrated the victory, their home city of Sinjar lay in complete ruins. Local Yazidi fighters who fought with Kurdish forces and some former residents have been taking any salvagable items out of the rubble, the town being uninhabitable and perilously close to the frontline.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Why are some people willing to risk their own lives – and even their children’s lives – to fight an enemy? An extraordinary study involving interviews with frontline fighters against the Islamic State, as well as IS fighters, finds that three crucial factors are at play. The most important was the strength of commitment to a “sacred” or deeply-held value or idea – but not necessarily a religious one. The findings “may help to inform policy decisions for the common defense,” wrote Ángel Gómez and his colleagues in their<b> </b><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3">new paper</a> in<b> </b><i>Nature Human Behaviour.</i></p>
<p><span id="more-30551"></span></p>
<p>Traditionally, most analyses of why groups choose to fight have focused on relative material strength – those with greater firepower and manpower are more willing to go to battle. But the authors of the new research point out, ever since World War II, insurgent groups have prevailed with as little as a tenth of the military muscle of state forces. “One plausible reason resides in the motivations of the combatants,” the researchers noted. “When group interests become sacred and non-negotiable, spiritual considerations trump material ones.”</p>
<p>To examine this idea, the researchers, all associated with <a href="http://artisinternational.org">Artis International</a>, a research institution set up to explore politically motivated violence, based in Arizona, US, set up a series of studies. In 2015, members of the team travelled to northern Iraq, to interview combatants fighting against so-called Islamic State forces (IS; also known variously as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh), including fighters from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, and they also interviewed some captured IS fighters. They also ran another field study in February and March this year on the same frontline, interviewing Peshmurga (Kurdish Regional Government forces), Iraqi army Kurds and Arab Sunni militia.</p>
<p>Based on earlier research, the team identified a likely set of “sacred values” for these groups. These included “Kurdeity” (a cultural concept denoting a sense of Kurdish language, heritage and land) and, for the Sunni Arab fighters, “Arabness” (also a cultural concept). A value was deemed “sacred” if an individual indicated that no amount of material gain would persuade them to give it up. For other people, ‘democracy’ might represent a sacred value.</p>
<p>The researchers examined how willing the fighters would be to make costly sacrifices, by asking if they’d be willing to die, let their family suffer, kill civilians, undertake a suicide attack and/or torture women and children for that value.</p>
<p>Since previous studies of combat soldiers have stressed devotion to comrades over cause, the researchers also systematically explored the extent to which the fighters were willing to sacrifice members of a group that they belonged to – including their comrades and their family – to fight for their value.</p>
<p>In addition, the researchers ran 14 online studies with more than 6,600 non-combatants from various regions of Spain, a country that has experienced recent IS terror attacks, to explore whether civilians may have similar attitudes. “Strikingly, the frontline and online studies converge on key determinants of willingness to make costly sacrifices,” the researchers noted.</p>
<p>Across groups, the three critical factors underlying people’s willingness to make sacrifices to fight for a cause were:</p>
<ul>
<li>having a commitment to non-negotiable sacred values and to groups that individuals were ‘wholly fused with’</li>
<li>a readiness to forsake kin for those values</li>
<li>a perception that the spiritual strength of the in-group versus the foe is more important than relative military might</li>
</ul>
<p>More than half of the fighters, when asked what was most important to them, stated at least one sacred value, such as “Arabness”, as being more important than their comrades or even their family.  This was generally not the case for the non-combatants from Spain (more than 77 per cent of whom said their family was more important to them than their most important “sacred value”). However, like the fighters, those minority of civilians who said a sacred value or values was more important to them than the groups they belonged to reported being more willing to make costly sacrifices.</p>
<p>For some anti-IS fighters, the sacrifices they made in prioritising their values over their family were horrific. “In some cases, ISIS has divulged children’s public executions for parents who opposed the Caliphate and its leader,” the researchers wrote. These choices were very difficult: “Indeed, frontline fighters would be highly emotional when discussing making such tragic choices.” But they still made them.</p>
<p>Results from both the frontline and the online studies also found that when it came to a willingness to make sacrifices, participants were less interested in the military might of an opponent than in the concept of “spiritual formidability”. Avowedly religious ISIS fighters and avowedly secular PKK fighters (the only force that held fast against the ISIS onslaught in summer 2014) alike firmly disregarded a consideration of their foe’s manpower and firepower, relative to their own, if they believed they had the upper hand in spiritual terms. The Kurdish fighters, for example, stated that what was important was “<i>ruhi bi ghiyrat”</i> – “spirituality with bravery”.</p>
<p>Some other studies – of opponents of the Gadaffi regime in Libya, for example, as well as of soldiers in the West – have concluded that a deep commitment to comrades is key to an individual’s fighting spirit. This study finds that commitment to a value “can trump group loyalty in willingness to fight”. As such, the researchers hope their findings will help policymakers wrangling with how best to deal with the threat posed by groups like IS. They add that an important subject for further study is why some groups are better able to inspire loyalty to an abstract cause than others.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/">Ketamine for Rapid Treatment of Depression</a></h4>

<p>A team of researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently discovered why the drug ketamine may act as a rapid antidepressant.</p>
<p>Ketamine is best known as an illicit, psychedelic club drug. Often referred to as “Special K” or a “horse tranquilizer” by the media, it has been around since the 1960s and is a staple anesthetic in emergency rooms and burn centers. In the last 10 years, studies have shown that it can reverse — sometimes within hours or even minutes — the kind of severe, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/">suicidal depression</a> that traditional antidepressants can’t treat.<span id="more-100331"></span></p>
<p>Researchers writing in the August 2010 issue of <a href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210856" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em></a> reported that people in a small study who had treatment-resistant <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2010/09/01/when-bipolar-patients-abuse-drugs-the-dual-diagnosis-dilemma/">bipolar disorder</a> experienced relief from <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/">depression</a> symptoms in as little as 40 minutes after getting an intravenous dose of ketamine. Eighteen of these people had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one antidepressant medication and a mood stabilizer; the average number of medications they had tried unsuccessfully was seven. Within 40 minutes, 9 of 16 (56 percent) of the participants receiving ketamine had at least a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, and 2 of 16 (13 percent) had full remission and became symptom-free. The response lasted an average of about a week.</p>
<p>In a small 2006 <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2006/experimental-medication-kicks-depression-in-hours-instead-of-weeks.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NIMH study</a>, one of the first to look at ketamine for depression, 18 treatment-resistant, depressed (unipolar) patients were randomly selected to receive either a single intravenous dose of ketamine or a placebo. Depression symptoms improved within one day in 71 percent of those who were given ketamine, and 29 percent of the patients became nearly symptom-free in a day. Thirty-five percent of patients who received ketamine still showed benefits seven days later.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7604/abs/nature17998.html">study</a> published online in the journal <em>Nature</em><em> </em>in May 2016, researchers discovered that a chemical byproduct, or metabolite, is created as the body breaks down ketamine. The metabolite reversed depression-like behaviors in mice without triggering any of the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/">anesthetic</a>, dissociative, or addictive side effects associated with ketamine.</p>
<p>As put by Carlos Zarate, MD, of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and a study coauthor and pioneer of research using ketamine to treat depression:</p>
<blockquote><p>This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of how this rapid antidepressant mechanism works, and holds promise for development of more robust and safer treatments. By using a team approach, researchers were able to reverse-engineer ketamine’s workings from the clinic to the lab to pinpoint what makes it so unique.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the <em>Nature</em> report, Sara Solovitch of <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-one-time-party-drug-is-helping-people-with-deep-depression/2016/02/01/d3e73862-b490-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a></em> wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p>experts are calling [ketamine] the most significant advance in mental health in more than half a century.</p></blockquote>
<p>She reported that many academic medical centers, including Yale University, the University of California in San Diego, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic, have all begun offering ketamine treatments off-label for severe depression.</p>
<p>It all sounds too good to be true, right?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks of Ketamine</h3>
<p>The predominant drawback of ketamine is the lack of data.</p>
<p>There haven’t been enough clinical trials on the drug to assure its safety, and there’s a lack of information on the long-term effects of its use.</p>
<p>Ketamine’s effects are also short-lived. To be used as an effective antidepressant, it would need to be administered regularly, which leads to concerns about addiction, tolerance, and, again, long-term effects. The data that we do have on long-term use comes from people who have taken ketamine recreationally, as well as those who have used it to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>One 2014 <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12094/abstract">study</a> published in the <em>British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</em> included among possible side effects, psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations and panic attacks), nausea, cardiovascular stimulation, memory defects, and bladder and renal complications.</p>
<p>Still, the drug holds promise for uncovering new ways of treating depression and offers hope for the most severe and complicated <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/07/24/articles-comparing-mood-disorders/">mood disorders</a> that baffle psychiatrists today.</p>
<p>Richard J. Hodes, MD, director of the National Institute on Aging, commented on the most recent NIH study and the importance of furthering the research:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unraveling the mechanism mediating ketamine’s antidepressant activity is an important step in the process of drug development. New approaches are critical for the treatment of depression, especially for older adults and for patients who do not respond to current medications.</p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-substrate-of-consciousness/">The substrate of consciousness</a></h4>

<p>Here I want to stir some ideas about the substrate of consciousness. Let us start with a few intuitive ideas: a human brain is conscious; an animal brain is probably conscious; a stone is not conscious; my stomach is not conscious; a single neuron or cell is not conscious; the brainstem or the visual cortex is not a separate conscious entity; two people do not form a single conscious entity.</p>
<p>Many of these ideas are in fact difficult to justify. Let us start with single cells. To see the problem, think first of organisms that consist of a single cell. For example, bacteria, or ciliates. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvOz4V699gk">this video</a>, an amoeba’s engulfs and then digests two paramecia. At some point, you can see the paramecia jumping all around as if they were panicking. Are these paramecia conscious, do they feel anything? If I did not know anything about their physiology or size, my first intuition would be that they do feel something close to fear. However, knowing that these are unicellular organisms and therefore do not have a nervous system, my intuition is rather that they are not actually conscious. But why?</p>
<p>Why do we think a nervous system is necessary for consciousness? One reason is that organisms to which we ascribe consciousness (humans and animals, or at least some animals) all have a nervous system. But it’s a circular argument, which has no logical validity. A more convincing reason is that in humans, the brain is necessary and sufficient for consciousness. A locked-in patient is still conscious. On the other hand, any large brain lesion has an impact on conscious experience, and specific experiences can be induced by electrical stimulation of the brain.</p>
<p>However, this tends to prove that the brain is the substrate of my experience, but it says nothing about, say, the stomach. The stomach also has a nervous system, it receives sensory signals and controls muscles. If it were conscious, I could not experience it, by definition, since you can only experience your own consciousness. So it could also be, just as for the brain, that the stomach is sufficient and necessary for consciousness of the gut mind: perhaps if you stimulate it electrically, it triggers some specific experience. As ridiculous as it might sound, I cannot discard the idea that the stomach is conscious just because I don’t feel that it’s conscious; I will need arguments of a different kind.</p>
<p>I know I am conscious, but I do not know whether there are other conscious entities in my body. Unfortunately, this applies not just to the stomach, but more generally to any other component of my body, whether it has a nervous system or not. What tells me that the liver is not conscious? Imagine I am a conscious liver. From my perspective, removing one lung, or a foot, or a large part of the visual cortex, has no effect on my conscious experience. So the fact that the brain is necessary and sufficient for your conscious experience doesn’t rule out the fact that some other substrate is necessary and sufficient for the conscious experience of another entity in your body. Now I am not saying that the question of liver consciousness is undecidable, only that we will need more subtle arguments than those exposed so far (discussed later).</p>
<p>Let us come back to the single cell. Although I feel that a unicellular organism is not conscious because it doesn’t have a nervous system, so far I have no valid argument for this intuition. In addition, it turns out that Paramecium, as many other unicellular organism including (at least some) bacteria, is an excitable cell with voltage-gated channels, structurally very similar to a neuron. So perhaps it has some limited form of consciousness after all. If this is true, then I would be inclined to say that all unicellular organisms are also conscious, for example bacteria. But then what about a single cell (eg a neuron) in your body, is it conscious? One might object that a single cell in a multicellular organism is not an autonomous organism. To address this objection, I will go one level below the cell.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells (eg your cells) have little energy factories called mitochondria. It turns out that mitochondria are in fact bacteria which have been engulfed in cells a very long (evolutionary) time ago. They have their own DNA, but they now live and reproduce inside cells. This is a case of endosymbiosis. If mitochondria were conscious before they lived in cells, why would they have lost consciousness when they started living in cells? So if we think bacteria are conscious, then we must admit that we have trillions of conscious entities in the cells of our body – not counting the bacteria in our digestive system. The concept of an autonomous organism is an illusion: any living organism depends on interactions with an ecosystem, and that ecosystem might well be a cell or a multicellular organism.</p>
<p>By the same argument, if we think unicellular organisms are conscious, then single neurons should be conscious, as well as all single cells in our body. This is not exclusive of the brain being conscious as a distinct entity.</p>
<p>A plausible alternative, of course, is that single cells are not conscious, although I have not yet proposed a good argument for this alternative. Before we turn to a new question, I will let you contemplate the fact that bacteria can form populations that are tightly <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7576/full/nature15709.html">coupled by electrical communication</a>. Does this make a bacteria colony conscious?</p>
<p>Let us now turn to another question. We can imagine that a cell is somehow minimally conscious, and that at the same time a brain forms a conscious entity of a different nature. Of course it might not be true, but there is a case for that argument. So now let us consider two people living their own life on opposite sides of the planet. Can this pair form a new conscious entity? Here, there are arguments to answer negatively. This is related to a concept called the <em>unity of consciousness</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose I see a red book. In the brain, some areas might respond to the color and some other areas might respond to the shape. It could be then that the color area experiences redness, and the shape area experience bookness. But I, as a single conscious unit, experiences a red book as a whole. Now if we consider two entities that do not interact, then there cannot be united experiences: somehow the redness and the bookness must be put together. So the substrate of a conscious entity cannot be made of parts that do not interact with the rest. Two separated people cannot form a conscious entity. But this does not rule out the possibility that two closely interacting people may not form a conscious superentity. Again, I do not believe this is the case, but we need to find new arguments to rule this out.</p>
<p>Now we finally have something a little substantial: a conscious entity must be made of components in interaction. From this idea follow a few remarks. First, consciousness is not a property of a substrate, but of the activity of a substrate (see a <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/neural-correlates-of-perception-whats-wrong-with-them/">previous blog post on this idea</a>). For example, if we freeze the brain in a particular state, it is not conscious. This rules out a number of inanimate objects (rocks) as conscious. Second, interactions take place in time. For example, it takes some time, up to a few tens of ms, for an action potential to travel from one neuron to another. This implies that a 1 ms time window cannot enclose a conscious experience. The “grain” of consciousness for a human brain should thus be no less than a few tens of milliseconds. In the same way, if a plant is conscious, then that consciousness cannot exist on a short timescale. This puts a constraint on the kind of experiences that can be ascribed to a particular substrate. Does consciousness require a nervous system? Maybe it doesn’t, but at least for large organisms, a nervous system is required to produce experiences on a short timescale.</p>
<p>I want to end with a final question. We are asking what kind of substrate gives rise to consciousness. But does consciousness require a fixed substrate? After all, the brain is dynamic. Synapses appear and disappear all the time, all the proteins get renewed regularly. The brain is literally a different set of molecules and a different structure from one day to the next. But the conscious entity remains. Or at least it seems so. This is what Buddhists call the illusion of self: contrary to your intuition, you are not the same person today and ten years ago; the self has no objective permanent existence. However, we can say that there is a continuity in conscious experience. That continuity, however, does not rely on a fixed material basis but more likely on some continuity of the underlying activity. Imagine for example a fictional worm that is conscious, but the substrate of consciousness is local. At some point it is produced by the interaction of neurons at some particular place of the nervous system, then that activity travels along the worm’s spine. The conscious entity remains and doesn’t feel like it’s travelling, it is simply grounded on a dynamic substrate.</p>
<p>Now I don’t think that this is true of the brain (or of the worm), but rather that long-range synchronization has something to do with the generation of a global conscious entity. However, it is conceivable that different subsets of neurons, even though they might span the same global brain areas, are involved in conscious experience at different times. In fact, this is even plausible. Most neurons don’t fire much, perhaps a few Hz on average. But one can definitely have a definite conscious experience over a fraction of second, and that experience thus can only involve the interaction of a subset of all neurons. We must conclude that the substrate of consciousness is actually not fixed but involve dynamic sets of neurons.</p>
<p>A summary of these remarks. I certainly have raised more questions than I have answered. In particular, it is not clear whether a single cell or a component of the nervous system (stomach, brainstem) is conscious. However, I have argued that: 1) any conscious experience requires the interaction of the components that produce it, and this interaction takes place in time; 2) the set of components that are involved in any particular experience is dynamic, despite the continuity in conscious experience.</p>

<p>Cast your mind back to your teenage maths lessons. Without a calculator, would you have been able to estimate the answer to the following sum?</p>
<blockquote><p> 12/13 + 7/8</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry about giving the precise number; just say whether it lies closest to 1, 2, 19, or 21*.</p>
<p>By the end of middle school, most American pupils have been studying fractions for a few years; these questions should be embarrassingly easy. But when Robert Siegler, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University posed the problem to a group of 8th graders (13 to 14 year olds), he found that they performed little better than if they’d simply guessed – with just 27 per cent choosing the right answer. In <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2010/June/june24_mathematicsresearch.shtml">another test</a>, around 50 per cent of 8<sup>th</sup> graders failed the arguably easier task of putting a series of simple fractions into size order, from smallest to biggest.</p>
<p>As if this dismal performance wasn’t depressing enough, it comes after decades of educational reforms. American educational psychologists <a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/2015-LF-etal.pdf">first identified that teens often struggled to understand fractions in 1978</a>, and since then various government commissions and teacher committees have attempted to address the issue, including thousands of educational studies and the introduction of widely used textbooks aimed specifically at deepening children’s understanding of fractions and decimals. These efforts may have amounted to billions of dollars’ worth of spending. Yet Siegler found next-to-no improvement in performance over the 40-year period.</p>
<p>Interestingly, students from other cultures – most notably, East Asian countries – do not face these problems. Siegler and his colleague Hugues Lortie-Forgues have explored the various potential explanations in their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%25252F0963721417700129">recent article</a> for <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>, including research that hints at a tantalizing link between language and mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p>As they point out, a basic understanding of fractions and decimals is essential for any further mathematical or science education – so finding a way to remove this stumbling block could have serious consequences for the pupils’ future careers.</p>
<p><span id="more-30421"></span></p>
<p>The pair first looked at the “inherent” sources of difficulty in these kind of fraction problems – the cognitive hurdles that every child must pass to arrive at the correct answer. The absolute size of the numerators and denominators in a fraction can be intuitively misleading. For example it takes some time and brainpower to work out that 5/11 is smaller than 2/3, since we need to discount the fact that 5 is bigger than 2, and 11 bigger than 3. As a result, even estimating the rough magnitude of a fraction becomes a burden, and that, in turn, could prevent you from checking whether your calculations are on track.</p>
<p>And there’s no getting away from the fact that the rules of fraction arithmetic can be a headache – you need to remember to convert the numbers to a common denominator when adding or subtracting, but not when multiplying, for instance. (1/3 + 1/2 becomes 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6, for instance.) As an adult these may not seem like huge cognitive leaps, but as a child the reasons can seem opaque and confusing.</p>
<p>Yet children in other cultures do not stumble over these hurdles – suggesting that the inherent sources of difficulty cannot be the whole explanation for why US kids struggle so much. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096514001568?via%25253Dihub">One study from 2015</a> compared the performance of 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> graders in the US and China on a test of fraction arithmetic. By the 6<sup>th</sup> grade, the Chinese students already reached about 90 per cent accuracy, compared to 32 per cent in the US. Even after two extra years of education, the US students only scored 60 per cent, lagging considerably behind the Chinese. (The same is apparently true for many East Asian cultures, including Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.)</p>
<p>For this reason, Siegler and Lortie-Forgues also examined the “culturally-contingent sources of difficulty” – which, to my mind, are far more revealing.</p>
<p>One possibility is that US teachers simply aren’t as good at maths as teachers in other countries, with various studies suggesting that the majority struggle with a conceptual understanding of fractions in particular. For instance, Siegler found that a majority of trainee teachers incorrectly predicted that multiplying two fractions less than one would result in an answer greater than one. Chinese, teachers, by contrast, are less likely to make these mistakes. Nor will the students find the right answers in their textbooks: Siegler and Lortie-Forgues argue that US maths books offer fewer examples and questions for students to practice – particularly on the trickier concepts, like division – compared to sample texts from East Asia.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most intriguing explanation involves the language we speak. East Asian languages phrase fractions in a more literal way: the Korean term for 1/3, <i>sam bun ui il</i>, translates as “of three parts, one” – compared to the English “one third”. This small difference means that even very young Korean children, in the 1<sup>st</sup> grade ( 5-7 year olds), can intuitively match a fraction to a picture – immediately elevating their mathematical understanding.</p>
<p>Together, these different factors may contribute to a kind of vicious cycle in the North American educational system. Students struggle to understand the basic mathematical concepts, and then, if they become teachers, they are less well-equipped to cultivate the necessary thinking in the next generations.</p>
<p>From a British perspective, I’d have been interested to read more about the cultural differences in the West. How do British and European schools compare to the US and East Asian schools? My guess (based on my own education) is that our students would certainly share some – if not all – of the difficulties faced by the American children. If nothing else, our shared language could be one barrier.</p>
<p>The big question, of course, is whether psychology can suggest ways to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematics. There is some hope that it might: for instance, one study found that simply changing the way we label fractions in English – so that it is closer to the Korean phrasing “of three parts, one” – seems to boost American children’s understanding. But in general, strong evidence for effective interventions is so far lacking.</p>
<p>That may change soon. Siegler and Lortie-Forgues say they are planning to test a new method that will attempt to build the children’s understand on stronger foundations, filling in many of the conceptual gaps that the students (and teachers) are currently missing. Will they succeed, where so many other initiatives have failed? Watch this space.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/WbaZDElTsqs/nature24281">Two independent modes of chromatin organization revealed by cohesin removal</a></h4>

<p>
 Imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers of chromosome organization, including segregation into megabase-large active and inactive compartments, and partitioning into sub-megabase domains (TADs). Yet, it remains unclear how these layers of organization form, interact with one another and impact genome functions. Here, we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl, in mouse liver, leads to a dramatic reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. In contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the 3D organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: 1) cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and 2) cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which contributes to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.

<p>
 Under homeostatic conditions, animals use well-defined hypothalamic neural circuits to help maintain stable body weight, by integrating metabolic and hormonal signals from the periphery to balance food consumption and energy expenditure. In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these ‘non-homeostatic’ conditions, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the ‘emergency circuit’ that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/P5v8QLjvtG8/nature24040">PAK signalling drives acquired drug resistance to MAPK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanomas</a></h4>

<p>
 Targeted BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) and combined BRAF and MEK inhibition (BRAFi and MEKi) therapies have markedly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma. Unfortunately, the efficacy of these treatments is often countered by the acquisition of drug resistance. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie acquired resistance to BRAFi and to the combined therapy. Consistent with previous studies, we show that resistance to BRAFi is mediated by ERK pathway reactivation. Resistance to the combined therapy, however, is mediated by mechanisms independent of reactivation of ERK in many resistant cell lines and clinical samples. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) become activated in cells with acquired drug resistance and have a pivotal role in mediating resistance. Our screening, using a reverse-phase protein array, revealed distinct mechanisms by which PAKs mediate resistance to BRAFi and the combined therapy. In BRAFi-resistant cells, PAKs phosphorylate CRAF and MEK to reactivate ERK. In cells that are resistant to the combined therapy, PAKs regulate JNK and β-catenin phosphorylation and mTOR pathway activation, and inhibit apoptosis, thereby bypassing ERK. Together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired drug resistance to current targeted therapies, and may help to direct novel drug development efforts to overcome acquired drug resistance.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kEd8ytbENaU/nature24039">CG dinucleotide suppression enables antiviral defence targeting non-self RNA</a></h4>

<p>
 Vertebrate genomes exhibit marked CG suppression—that is, lower than expected numbers of 5′-CG-3′ dinucleotides. This feature is likely to be due to C-to-T mutations that have accumulated over hundreds of millions of years, driven by CG-specific DNA methyl transferases and spontaneous methyl-cytosine deamination. Many RNA viruses of vertebrates that are not substrates for DNA methyl transferases mimic the CG suppression of their hosts. This property of viral genomes is unexplained. Here we show, using synonymous mutagenesis, that CG suppression is essential for HIV-1 replication. The deleterious effect of CG dinucleotides on HIV-1 replication was cumulative, associated with cytoplasmic RNA depletion, and was exerted by CG dinucleotides in both translated and non-translated exonic RNA sequences. A focused screen using small inhibitory RNAs revealed that zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) inhibited virion production by cells infected with CG-enriched HIV-1. Crucially, HIV-1 mutants containing segments whose CG content mimicked random nucleotide sequence were defective in unmanipulated cells, but replicated normally in ZAP-deficient cells. Crosslinking–immunoprecipitation–sequencing assays demonstrated that ZAP binds directly and selectively to RNA sequences containing CG dinucleotides. These findings suggest that ZAP exploits host CG suppression to identify non-self RNA. The dinucleotide composition of HIV-1, and perhaps other RNA viruses, appears to have adapted to evade this host defence.

<p>
 The dynamic and reversible acetylation of proteins, catalysed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is a major epigenetic regulatory mechanism of gene transcription and is associated with multiple diseases. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently approved to treat certain cancers, but progress on the development of drug-like histone actyltransferase inhibitors has lagged behind. The histone acetyltransferase paralogues p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key transcriptional co-activators that are essential for a multitude of cellular processes, and have also been implicated in human pathological conditions (including cancer). Current inhibitors of the p300 and CBP histone acetyltransferase domains, including natural products, bi-substrate analogues and the widely used small molecule C646, lack potency or selectivity. Here, we describe A-485, a potent, selective and drug-like catalytic inhibitor of p300 and CBP. We present a high resolution (1.95 Å) co-crystal structure of a small molecule bound to the catalytic active site of p300 and demonstrate that A-485 competes with acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). A-485 selectively inhibited proliferation in lineage-specific tumour types, including several haematological malignancies and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer. A-485 inhibited the androgen receptor transcriptional program in both androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and inhibited tumour growth in a castration-resistant xenograft model. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using small molecule inhibitors to selectively target the catalytic activity of histone acetyltransferases, which may provide effective treatments for transcriptional activator-driven malignancies and diseases.

<p>
 The ability to directly uncover the contributions of genes to a given phenotype is fundamental for biology research. However, ostensibly homogeneous cell populations exhibit large clonal variance that can confound analyses and undermine reproducibility. Here we used genome-saturated mutagenesis to create a biobank of over 100,000 individual haploid mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell lines targeting 16,970 genes with genetically barcoded, conditional and reversible mutations. This Haplobank is, to our knowledge, the largest resource of hemi/homozygous mutant mES cells to date and is available to all researchers. Reversible mutagenesis overcomes clonal variance by permitting functional annotation of the genome directly in sister cells. We use the Haplobank in reverse genetic screens to investigate the temporal resolution of essential genes in mES cells, and to identify novel genes that control sprouting angiogenesis and lineage specification of blood vessels. Furthermore, a genome-wide forward screen with Haplobank identified PLA2G16 as a host factor that is required for cytotoxicity by rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold. Therefore, clones from the Haplobank combined with the use of reversible technologies enable high-throughput, reproducible, functional annotation of the genome.

<p>
 Catecholamine-induced lipolysis, the first step in the generation of energy substrates by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, declines with age. The defect in the mobilization of free fatty acids in the elderly is accompanied by increased visceral adiposity, lower exercise capacity, failure to maintain core body temperature during cold stress, and reduced ability to survive starvation. Although catecholamine signalling in adipocytes is normal in the elderly, how lipolysis is impaired in ageing remains unknown. Here we show that adipose tissue macrophages regulate the age-related reduction in adipocyte lipolysis in mice by lowering the bioavailability of noradrenaline. Unexpectedly, unbiased whole-transcriptome analyses of adipose macrophages revealed that ageing upregulates genes that control catecholamine degradation in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Deletion of NLRP3 in ageing restored catecholamine-induced lipolysis by downregulating growth differentiation factor-3 (GDF3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) that is known to degrade noradrenaline. Consistent with this, deletion of GDF3 in inflammasome-activated macrophages improved lipolysis by decreasing levels of MAOA and caspase-1. Furthermore, inhibition of MAOA reversed the age-related reduction in noradrenaline concentration in adipose tissue, and restored lipolysis with increased levels of the key lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Our study reveals that targeting neuro-immunometabolic signalling between the sympathetic nervous system and macrophages may offer new approaches to mitigate chronic inflammation-induced metabolic impairment and functional decline.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/He9xqeR44oY/nature24019">Early trace of life from 3.95 Ga sedimentary rocks in Labrador, Canada</a></h4>

<p>
 The vestiges of life in Eoarchean rocks have the potential to elucidate the origin of life. However, gathering evidence from many terrains is not always possible, and biogenic graphite has thus far been found only in the 3.7–3.8 Ga (gigayears ago) Isua supracrustal belt. Here we present the total organic carbon contents and carbon isotope values of graphite (δ13Corg) and carbonate (δ13Ccarb) in the oldest metasedimentary rocks from northern Labrador. Some pelitic rocks have low δ13Corg values of −28.2, comparable to the lowest value in younger rocks. The consistency between crystallization temperatures of the graphite and metamorphic temperature of the host rocks establishes that the graphite does not originate from later contamination. A clear correlation between the δ13Corg values and metamorphic grade indicates that variations in the δ13Corg values are due to metamorphism, and that the pre-metamorphic value was lower than the minimum value. We concluded that the large fractionation between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg values, up to 25‰, indicates the oldest evidence of organisms greater than 3.95 Ga. The discovery of the biogenic graphite enables geochemical study of the biogenic materials themselves, and will provide insight into early life not only on Earth but also on other planets.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ruC6rDQd7vw/nature24017">Retrograde semaphorin–plexin signalling drives homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

<p>
 Homeostatic signalling systems ensure stable but flexible neural activity and animal behaviour. Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity is a conserved form of neuronal homeostatic signalling that is observed in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. Defining the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuronal homeostatic signalling will be essential in order to establish clear connections to the causes and progression of neurological disease. During neural development, semaphorin–plexin signalling instructs axon guidance and neuronal morphogenesis. However, semaphorins and plexins are also expressed in the adult brain. Here we show that semaphorin 2b (Sema2b) is a target-derived signal that acts upon presynaptic plexin B (PlexB) receptors to mediate the retrograde, homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. Further, we show that Sema2b–PlexB signalling regulates presynaptic homeostatic plasticity through the cytoplasmic protein Mical and the oxoreductase-dependent control of presynaptic actin. We propose that semaphorin–plexin signalling is an essential platform for the stabilization of synaptic transmission throughout the developing and mature nervous system. These findings may be relevant to the aetiology and treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases that are characterized by altered or inappropriate neural function and behaviour.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/iIPwwWFEt4E/nature23912">Massively parallel de novo protein design for targeted therapeutics</a></h4>

<p>
 De novo protein design holds promise for creating small stable proteins with shapes customized to bind therapeutic targets. We describe a massively parallel approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders, integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660 mini-proteins of 37–43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/animal-1850235_960_720-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Cetaceans are aquatic mammals comprising whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Field evidence has shown that cetacean populations live in large complex groups, experiencing varied relationships. As they function with alliances and orders, like we have in our human societies, they communicate and collaborate in groups.</p>
<p>These animals are considered to have a relatively large brain size relative to body size, assumed to relate to their high intelligence. Cetaceans and primates are among the mammals with the highest intelligence, which is thought to be due to an evolutionary expansion of brain size, driven primarily by the seven primary microcephaly (MCPH) genes. This change could relate to the increasingly complex social demands of a group living environment.</p>
<p>To investigate this, and whether this hypothesis is justified at the molecular level in cetaceans, researchers from Nanjing Normal University in China set out to investigate the genetic basis of cetacean brain size development. In this <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1051-7">study</a> led by Dr Shixia Xu and her colleagues, the team analysed seven loci of MCPH genes which affect brain size development in cetaceans.</p>
<p>The MCPH genes are known to be associated with neurodevelopment disorders in humans, as they play a key role in brain development. Other protein regulators such as CEP152 play a part in cell division and brain development. MCPH in particular has been thought to be responsible for the increase in brain size in mammals.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-9514 alignright" height="188" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/dna-1388692_960_720-300x169.jpg" width="334" />
<p>The authors looked for evidence of MCPH genes that had been under positive selection during cetacean evolution. They found a connection between increasing encephalization quotient (EQ – a measure of relative brain size) and the MCPH genes comprising ASPM and CDK5RAP2, suggesting these genes may have played a role in the brain size expansion of cetaceans.</p>
<p>To find out whether social complexity was a driving force in the expansion of cetacean brain size, the researchers used pre-existing research from thirteen cetacean species, to determine mean group size and social complexity. This data was compared with identified locations of positively selected sites in 3D visualised structures of the MCPH genes.</p>
<p>Using methods for statistical analysis, the researchers found a strong link between the rate of evolutionary change in a genotype and mean group size for ASPM and CDK5RAP2 genes. This helped indicate that cetaceans evolved these larger brains to deal with increasingly complex social environments, supporting  the ‘social brain hypothesis’ – the idea that species living in complex social environments must evolve larger brains to process complex information.</p>
<p>This research supports the idea that cetaceans evolved a larger brain size relative to body size, due to an increasing need for intelligence to cope with their increasingly complex social groups. The authors suggest that further investigations into the ‘social brain hypothesis’ could involve the investigation of other ecological factors such as behaviour and feeding, in relation to the MCPH gene.</p>

<p>In the UK, more and more of our children are learning mindfulness at school. The <a href="https://mindfulnessinschools.org">Mindfulness in Schools</a> project claims that over 4000 of our teachers are now trained in the practice. However, some experts are concerned that the roll-out of mindfulness has raced ahead of the evidence base, which paints a mixed picture.</p>
<p>Following their <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796716300389">recent failure</a> to find any benefits of a school mindfulness programme for teenagers (contrary to some earlier <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23787061">more positive findings</a>), a research team led by Catherine Johnson at Flinders University has now <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671730181X">reported in <em>Behaviour Research and Therapy</em></a> the results of their latest school trial, which included new features in the mindfulness intervention, such as parental involvement and better designed homework materials, intended to maximise the programme’s effectiveness. However, once again the mindfulness programme led to no observable benefits.</p>
<p><span id="more-30003"></span></p>
<p>The nine-week Mindfulness Programme used in the current trial was based on the popular <em>.b</em> Mindfulness in School’s curriculum, which features various elements, including: the eponymous “stop and be” (.b) technique that involves stopping, feeling your feet, feeling your breathing and being present; training in how to be more mindful in everyday activities; and relaxation practices. Daily practice at home was encouraged.</p>
<p>Three hundred and seventy-eight teenagers from four urban schools in Australia were allocated to take part in the weekly 40- to 60-minute training sessions. About half of this group took part in a version of the programme that actively involved their parents, through an initial parents’ evening session and the receipt of weekly Youtube clips of their child’s training sessions. Another 182 teens from the same schools acted as controls and did not participate in any of the mindfulness classes. The average age of the participating pupils was 13 years.</p>
<p>Compared with earlier trials, the mindfulness programme included additional elements designed to maximise engagement and the chances for the programme being a success. This included asking teachers to participate alongside their pupils, providing teachers with audio files for practising techniques with their pupils outside of the formal sessions, and improved course materials such as colourful classroom posters and quizzes. The mindfulness training was delivered by the trial’s lead author who is a highly experienced mindfulness practitioner and trainer.</p>
<p>The participating pupils completed a wide range of psychological measures at baseline, after the nine-week programme was complete, and again at six- and 12-month follow up, including questionnaires tapping their levels of anxiety and depression, their concerns with their weight, their overall wellbeing, and their levels of everyday mindfulness.</p>
<p>Participants who completed the mindfulness programme showed no benefits on any measure, either immediately or after the programme or at follow-up. It made no difference whether they were in the version of the programme that included parental engagement (participation by parents was extremely poor – only 8 per cent attended the initial evening session – prompting the researchers to suggest this approach may be a poor use of resources).</p>
<p>These results may not surprise readers who are sceptical of all the hype around mindfulness. The researchers, who are mindfulness enthusiasts, wonder if perhaps the early teen years are not the optimum time to teach mindfulness. “Despite the added capacity [compared with younger kids] for abstract thought to allow skills such as metacognition to unfold, perhaps more ‘cynical’ early adolescents require increased life challenges before the relevance of socioemotional tools becomes evident,” they said, adding: “Further research is required to identify the optimal age, content and length of programs delivering mindfulness to adolescents”.</p>

A critical signaling protein, TOR forms multiprotein associations that function as distinct clusters, either as TORC1 (TOR Complex 1) or TORC2 (TOR Complex 2), depending upon those additional proteins. In their 2007 <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a></strong> article, Hall and colleagues <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001217" target="_blank">identified novel TOR interacting proteins specific for each complex</a></strong>, investigating the role of phosphorylation and complex function for each. More recently, work from the Hall group published in <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Genetics</em></a></strong> demonstrated a role for <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004145" target="_blank">TORC1 in bone formation</a></strong> and, in yeast cells, characterized the <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120250" target="_blank">signaling state of the TORC1 complex</a></strong> with the use of antibody tools.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/hpv-vaccines-cancer-prevention/" target="_blank">Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award</a></strong> was jointly awarded to John Schiller and Douglas Lowy for their collaborative efforts, innovations and ”technological advances that enabled development of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for prevention of cervical cancer and other tumors caused by human papillomaviruses.” Papillomavirus infection on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals can cause benign warts (papillomas) or malignancies, especially anogenital carcinomas, and in genetically predisposed or immunocompromised individuals can cause skin cancer. Development of safe and effective vaccines has potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and other malignancies resulting from HPV.</p>
<p>Schiller and Lowry collaborated on three articles published with PLOS. In the early days of <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Pathogens</em></a></strong>, they demonstrated that carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from red algae, was an <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020069" target="_blank">extremely potent infection inhibitor for sexually transmitted genital HPVs</a></strong>. Their most recent joint publication (also in <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>) <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004314" target="_blank">investigates papillomavirus in various mouse models</a></strong>, to gain insights into immune system influences on infection progression in humans. These articles, together with <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068329" target="_blank">results of a clinical trial of bivalent HPV vaccination</a></strong> have received nearly 83,000 views.

Get your earplugs ready because this post is metal. Last week, a group of neuroscientists published a paper reporting altered brain activity in heavy metal lovers.



The paper raised a few eyebrows, not least for its statement that metal fans show "disorders of behavioral and emotional cognition." It's already attracted some convincing critical comments on PubPeer. To my mind, the paper is a perfect example of a flawed neuroimaging study.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>The latest version of psychiatry’s principal diagnostic manual (the DSM-V) defines Hoarding Disorder as a psychopathology where the collection of items significantly impacts the person’s functioning, as they find it difficult and indeed painful to discard the items, creating congestion within the home and encouraging poor hygiene and accidents. However not only objects, but also living things can be collected pathologically, popularly enshrined in the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_lady">a “cat lady”</a>. According to the psychiatric manual, this is just a special case of hoarding. But a team of psychologists from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has investigated people who hoard animals, and in their <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117301518">new paper</a> in <i>Psychiatry Research</i> they make the case that it ought to be considered a distinct illness.</p>
<p><span id="more-30401"></span></p>
<p>Elisa Arrienti Ferreira and her colleagues investigated animal hoarding cases in the city of Porto Alegre, following up a survey conducted by the city’s Secretariat for Animal Rights. Of 75 potential cases, they managed to reach residents in 48 dwellings, and from those, found 33 who agreed to participate and fit the diagnostic criteria for the animal subtype of hoarding. The team arrived with vets to check the conditions of animals, they also surveyed the conditions of the residence and interviewed the animal hoarders about their lives.</p>
<p>The conditions in which these people lived might be hard to take in: there were a total of 1,357 animals – “composed of 915 dogs, 382 cats, and 50 ducks” – with an average of 41 per hoarder. Only 22 per cent ensured their animals were neutered, and the sanitary and health conditions were often very poor. The researchers also report that “dramatic situations such as violent fights for territory, extreme malnutrition, cannibalism, caged animals injured and untreated, were observed in most of the houses visited.”</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the hoarders were elderly, but they’d all begun accumulating animals earlier in their lives. Ferreira’s team speculate that it’s only later in life when the burden of animal collection becomes most apparent, as the number proliferate due to the individual’s reluctance to give animals away. Two-thirds of animal hoarders were women, and most lived alone, consistent with the sense that the animals provided companionship and comfort to people who otherwise struggle to form relationships.</p>
<p>There are a two main reasons why Ferreira’s team advocate for this to be considered as separate from standard hoarding. First, some of the technical definition of hoarding just seems off: take the concept of “congestion”, which makes sense in a house piled precariously high with magazines or wine bottles, but doesn’t really apply to mobile creatures. Second, the researchers note that their sample also seemed to show more self-awareness than is associated with object hoarding, many admitting to difficulties that resulted from their compulsion, and recognising that it took a toll on their quality of life.</p>
<p>If they see the problem, why don’t the animal hoarders do something about it? Well, it’s harder to rid yourself of an animal than trash, both logistically and emotionally. The presence of care-bonding with living things transforms the dynamic, and would suggest that the tactics appropriate for managing an item-hoarder may simply not apply in these cases. The researchers conclude that distinguishing animal hoarding as its own mental health condition can lead to investment into interventions that address a disorder that “causes serious damage to the environment, suffering for individuals, their families, and the animals.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/iStock_000019033862Large-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Sexual harassment at work includes unwanted verbal, non-verbal and physical sexual behaviors. Previous research shows that sexual harassment can lead to decreased job satisfaction and lower mental health, including more depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>In 2015, we started a research project focusing specifically on sexual harassment conducted by customers and clients (including patients). The research project included a cross sectional study on the relation between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms. The study draws on data from 7,603 Danish employees.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant? The phenomenon has received very little attention in research and practice, although clients and customers are more likely to be the source of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Among the 7,603 employees in our study, 2.4% (180) reported exposure to sexual harassment from clients or customers during the last 12 months. In comparison, 1.0% (79) were harassed by other employees (including colleagues, supervisors and subordinates).</p>
<p>The prevalence was markedly higher among women in care work with 152 out 2,191 (6.9%) reporting exposure to sexual harassment from clients or customers.</p>
<p>To me these numbers underline the need to investigate sexual harassment by clients and patients further. The question is – are we talking about the same phenomenon? Or does it matter who the perpetrator is?</p>
<blockquote><p>Compared to employees who were not harassed, employees harassed by clients or customers scored 2.05 points higher on the major depression Inventory.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of our primary research questions was therefore to examine if the negative effects depend on whether the perpetrator is a client /customer or another employee.</p>
<p>The analyses revealed two important findings. First, compared to employees who were not harassed, employees harassed by clients or customers scored 2.05 points higher on the major depression Inventory (MDI) – a self-reported mood questionnaire that generates a diagnosis of depression and an estimate of symptom severity. Scores of 20 points or more are considered as an indicator for a probable depression.</p>
<p>Because we measured depression and exposure to sexual harassment at the same time, we cannot draw conclusions on cause and effect. Nevertheless, the findings support the notion that sexual harassment from clients and customers is associated with more depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Second, much to our surprise, employees harassed by other employees scored 2.45 points higher on the MDI compared to employees who had experienced sexual harassment by clients or customers.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these findings underline a need to consider sexual harassment by clients/customers and sexual harassment by other employees as two distinct types of harassment.</p>
<p>As part of the research project, we have also conducted a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260613">qualitative study on sexual harassment in care work</a>. Findings from this suggests that sexual harassment from patients is a taboo, and that employees consider the harassment an inherent part of their job.</p>
<p>In many instances patients do not harass the employees deliberately and cannot be held accountable for their actions, for instance when the inappropriate sexual behaviors is a result of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>The qualitative study also showed, that -in practice, separating between intentional and unintentional harassment is complex and not straightforward. This therefore constitutes a specific dilemma for employees exposed to sexual harassment from patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I find that it is prudent to put sexual harassment from customers and clients on the agenda – especially in the workplace. We need to break the taboo and stop normalizing sexual harassment by patients as a part of the job.</p>

<p>
 Pathogens have to balance transmission with persistence. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent malaria parasite, persistence within its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells (RBCs), while its mosquito-borne transmission depends on intra-erythrocytic differentiation into non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes1. Commitment to either fate is determined during the preceding cell cycle that begins with invasion by a single, asexually-committed merozoite and ends, 48 hours later, with a schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, all committed to either continued asexual replication or differentiation into gametocytes2,3. Sexual commitment requires activation of ap2-g (PF3D7_1222600)4,5, the transcriptional master regulator of sexual development, from an epigenetically silenced state during asexual replication6,7. AP2-G expression during this ‘commitment cycle’ poises gene expression in nascent merozoites to initiate sexual development through a hitherto unknown mechanism2,4. In order to maintain a persistent infection, ap2-g expression is limited to a sub-population of parasites (1-30%, depending on genetic background and growth conditions). As sexually-committed schizonts comprise only a sub-population and are morphologically indistinguishable from their asexually-committed counterparts, defining their characteristic gene expression has been difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling8. To determine the transcriptional changes induced by AP2-G within this sub-population, we applied highly-parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)9 to malaria cultures undergoing sexual commitment. In this first application of scRNA-seq to eukaryotic pathogens, we surveyed over 18,000 single parasite transcriptomes from a conditional AP2-G knockdown (AP2-G-DD) line and NF54 wild-type parasite at multiple stages of development (Fig. 1A, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1) and found that sexually committed, AP2-G+ mature schizonts specifically up-regulate additional regulators of gene expression, including other AP2 transcription factors, histone modifying enzymes, and regulators of nucleosome positioning. These epigenetic regulators likely act to poise the expression/repression of genes necessary for the initiation of gametocyte development in the subsequent cell cycle.

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/22/older-age-dementia-and-circadian-rhythms/">Older Age, Dementia, and Circadian Rhythms</a></h4>

<p>It is common knowledge that sleep patterns change with age. Older people tend to sleep less, their sleep can be shallow and fragmented. Often they sleep very little at night, spending few hours in bed during the daytime. The problem becomes serious in older people suffering from dementia, especially from the caretaker’s perspective.  </p>
<p>Researchers discovered several brain processes that influence these sleeping pattern changes. One particularly interesting finding from this research (which may also inform approaches for addressing the problem) is the finding that light exposure has serious effects on the circadian rhythm in the elderly.</p>
<p>Our visual sensory system performs two major tasks: the gathering and processing of visual information (the visual response), and the control of the biological clock that regulates the production of several important hormones (the non-visual response). The majority of living organisms have a non-visual response to the day-night cycle, where body functions adjust to specific periods within a 24 hour day (circadian cycle).</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms regulate the sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, hormone release (e.g., melatonin and cortisol), and gene expression. Circadian rhythms are not set in stone and have to be fine-tuned to the actual experience of the timing and duration of day and night, which are subject to seasonal changes and geographic location. The importance of synchronized circadian regulation is obvious if we consider the physiological and behavioral disruptions caused by jet lag.</p>
<p>In 2005, our eyes were discovered to have a specific photosensitive cell type named intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that are primarily involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. These cells are sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths with maximal light absorption at blue light wavelengths of around 480 nm. It is believed that ipRGCs are tuned to the dominant wavelength of light at twilight. During twilight (i.e., at dawn and dusk) the sun is close to the horizon and there is a relative enrichment of ‘blue’ light in the dome of the sky because of the preferential scattering of short wavelengths of light passing obliquely through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The signals from ipRGCs are processed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus that is considered the key circadian pacemaker in the brain. The suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates the release of melatonin, a hormone crucial to the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, with blue light stimulating the most powerful changes in the melatonin secretion rhythm.</p>
<p>Visual and non-visual systems respond differently to the quantity of light and timing of light exposure. The quantity of polychromatic white light necessary to activate the non-visual circadian system is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the amount that activates the visual system. The reaction time of two systems is also different: while the visual system responds to a light stimulus very quickly (in milliseconds), the duration of light exposure needed to affect the circadian system can take minutes. The effects of light on the circadian system depends on the infusion of melatonin into the bloodstream, increasing the response time.</p>
<p><strong>How circadian rhythms get affected with advanced age?</strong></p>
<p>Our sensitivity to light stimuli reduces with the age. Multiple studies demonstrate that neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is reduced in the elderly, especially after the age of 80, and circadian rhythm amplitude is also reduced after the age of 50. This means that the intensity of the response of the non-visual system to light stimuli is reduced, sometimes very substantially. The direct consequence of this muted response is the lack of proper regulation and adjustment of circadian rhythms to the day/night cycle. Disturbances in circadian rhythms leading to poor sleep in older adults can be the result of dysfunctional circadian pathways or a pathway that cannot process light information with as much fidelity.</p>
<p>The first stage of phototransduction (when light signals are converted into neural signals) is negatively affected in older people: older adults have reduced optical transmission at short wavelengths that are maximally effective for the regulation of circadian system (i.e., blue light).</p>
<p>Older adults also tend to lead a more sedentary indoor lifestyle, with less access to bright light during the day, potentially increasing the risk for circadian disruption.</p>
<p>It is well-established that visual task performance improves with increased light levels, regardless of age. However, the need for light for visual task performance increases with age due to age-related losses in retinal illumination. These losses are reasonably uniform over time, with a 10% loss per ten years of aging. Thus, a ninety-year-old would require ten times the light of a 10-year-old for similar photoreception. The effect on circadian rhythmicity is further exacerbated with age because the shorter violet and blue wavelengths (400–500 nm) are most affected by yellowing of the aging eye.</p>
<p>It is also worth keeping in mind that older people often have reduced eyesight, suffer from blurred vision, and may have age-related eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and other conditions.</p>
<p><strong>How circadian rhythms get affected in neurological conditions?</strong></p>
<p>Neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer’s disease and similar conditions may affect multiple parts of the brain, including the parts involved in regulation of circadian rhythms. In Alzheimer’s disease, the suprachiasmatic nucleus deteriorates, contributing to alterations in circadian rhythms. This deterioration exacerbates the age-related loss of neuronal activity in the nucleus. Sleep disturbances, agitated behaviour, and depression are very common in people suffering from dementia.</p>
<p><strong>What can be done to counteract these negative changes? </strong></p>
<p>Bright light therapy has emerged as one of the most harmless and effective approaches to manage sleep disturbances in elderly people and patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Researchers have demonstrated that increased exposure to bright light may increase the amplitude of circadian rhythms, i.e., clearly enhances the intensity of the response to daily 24-hour cycles. Bright light exposure during the morning or evenings may help in consolidating circadian rhythms. Additionally, increased exposure to blue light may be beneficial, as photoreceptors in ipRGCs are more easily activated at these wavelengths.</p>
<p>The points above were incorporated into the development of a number of experimental light therapies aimed at stimulating the normal functioning of the non-visual system in the elderly and people with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.</p>
<p>Light therapy may be delivered in a variety of ways, such as using a light box placed approximately one meter away from the participants at a height within their visual field; a headworn light visor; ceiling mounted light fixtures; or naturalistic light therapy—known as dawn-dusk simulation—that mimics outdoor twilight transitions.</p>
<p>Published research data suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be reversed by stimulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus with light. Clinical research has shown that light therapy can consolidate rest and activity patterns in people with dementia.</p>
<p>There is a diverse choice of various electric light sources these days, and with proper selection, a balanced and circadian-effective lighting regime can be achieved in spaces with insufficient daylight illumination. The spectral characteristics and intensity of electric lights should be adjusted to the time of the day. Currently, the LED Luminaire™ is being developed that auto-tunes interior lighting to mimic the full spectrum of natural daylight throughout the day, with characteristics that can be “tuned” for older adults. This would provide quality illumination for visual tasks and help synchronize biological rhythms for better health, cognitive ability, and performance.</p>

<img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-9429 size-full" height="5000" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-8_Editors-pick-_A-well-armed-coral-reef_Michelle-Achlatis.jpg" width="6666" />
<h3><strong>What is your profession?</strong></h3>
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marine Ecology at the Coral Reef Ecosystems Laboratory at the University of Queensland in Australia.</p>
<h3><strong>What type of research are you involved in?</strong></h3>
<p>The lab I work in is interested in all things coral reefs. We study a variety of key reef organisms on the genetic, physiological and ecological level, we examine their roles on coral reefs and we assess how these ecosystems are responding to climate change. My Ph.D. research, in particular, focuses on a specific type of sponges, namely bioeroding sponges, which excavate and inhabit coral skeletons often killing the coral in the process. My project aims to understand the metabolic dynamics of sponge bioerosion on the present and future coral reefs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you become interested in this area of research?</strong></h3>
<p>As part of my studies I was lucky enough to visit a tropical coral reef, and then I was hooked. I won’t pretend that what drew my interest was the importance of coral reefs for global marine biodiversity, their productivity and the livelihoods they support, or the significant ecosystem goods and services they provide as I had learned in the classroom. At the time, it was just the plain beauty of the place. Years later this ecosystem still has so much to teach me.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you become interested in photography?</strong></h3>
<p>I think I owe this interest to my auntie’s coffee table – there was always some wildlife magazine laying around. As an undergraduate student, my involvement with the amateur photography group of the University of Crete (Greece) was a great inspiration. Wildlife and landscapes are still my favorite picture subjects.</p>
<h3><strong>Where and how was this photo taken?</strong></h3>
<p>This photo was taken during working hours at Harry’s Bommie on Heron Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef in Australia in February 2016. My colleagues and I were on scuba hanging in the water column in between sampling times for a coral physiology experiment we were conducting just a few meters away. I saw the octopus from the corner of my eye. It saw me too and instantly transformed itself into a coral, in shape and color. It wasn’t fast enough to hide, so instead, it froze in place. I couldn’t have wished for an easier, more stable shot.</p>
<h3><strong>Why were you there at the time?</strong></h3>
<p>Heron Island is a small coral cay near the Tropic of Capricorn and it is surrounded by a fringing platform reef. The University of Queensland runs a small research station on the island. The station is frequented by marine and terrestrial researchers who come to conduct their work at this relatively untouched offshore site. Together with my colleagues, we perform most of our field-work and experiments on Heron.</p>
<h3><strong>Can you explain a bit more about the image?</strong></h3>
<p>Coral reefs are underwater forests formed over years by the slow build-up of coral skeletons. What makes them special is that thanks to the partnership between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates, coral reefs can thrive in shallow sunlit waters that would otherwise be too poor nutritionally to sustain such biodiverse ecosystems. Multiple other life forms are housed in the complex framework that corals build. The image exemplifies how some of the smartest residents of reefs use the habitat to shelter and camouflage against predators.</p>
<h3><strong>What about this scene particularly interested you?</strong></h3>
<p>To be honest, an octopus is in itself a photogenic creature. But the camouflaging behavior it exhibited with the coral in the background was even more worth a shot. At the time, in the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef abnormally high seawater temperatures were pushing the symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates beyond all limits. The reef was undergoing a mass coral bleaching event. Down south at Heron corals were spared the heat, yet I couldn’t help but wonder what the fate of such an octopus would be -or the fate of various other fauna- on a bleached or dead reef.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Feeling positive emotions is good for your physical health, right? There’s certainly evidence in support of the idea. But it’s mostly come from studies of people living in Western countries. Now <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797617713309">a study</a> published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, concludes that for people in Japan, it may not be the case.</p>
<p>While positive emotions, like happiness, are seen as a good thing in the US, UK, and elsewhere in Europe, the picture is different in east Asia: they aren’t seen being as necessarily desirable, and negative emotions aren’t considered to be all that bad. As the researchers, led by Jiah Yoo at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US, write in their introduction: “No study to date has directly compared the biological correlates of positive affect across cultures.”</p>
<p><span id="more-30373"></span></p>
<p>The researchers studied 1,017 men and women living in America, and 374 men and women in Japan (selected to be representative of the general population). The participants rated how frequently they had felt each of 10 positive emotions over the past 30 days (including happiness, cheerfulness, “calm and peaceful”, “full of life” and proud). They also gave blood samples, which were checked for levels of HDL-cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol). An unhealthy cholesterol profile increases the risk of heart disease – the world’s biggest killer – but can be improved through exercise and healthy eating, for example.</p>
<p>The researchers controlled statistically for the influence of age, gender and years of education – all known to be linked to cholesterol profiles – and negative emotions over the past month (to be sure that positive emotions were associated with cholesterol independently of these demographic factors or negative emotions). They also measured participants’ smoking, alcohol consumption, healthy eating, and body mass index (BMI) to see if these were relevant to any potential links between emotion and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>For the Americans in the study, experiencing higher levels of positive emotions was indeed associated with having a healthier cholesterol profile, so much so, in fact, as to be clinically significant. But there was no such association whatsoever for the Japanese.</p>
<p>When the researchers dug further into the data they found that the cultural difference in the association between positive emotions and cholesterol was, to a large extent, related to body mass index (BMI). Americans, but not Japanese, who felt more positive emotions also tended to have a lower BMI, which might explain their lower cholesterol – people who are not overweight generally have a healthier cholesterol profile. There was also evidence that Americans who had a lower BMI and felt more positive emotions did more exercise.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded: “These results are consistent with a theoretical prediction that a good fit between one’s emotions and one’s culturally prescribed values and beliefs may motivate a healthier lifestyle. Frequent experience of positive affect in the Western context would be aligned with prescribed values and beliefs and thus likely motivate engagement in and pursuit of healthy behaviours.”</p>
<p>However, there are other possible explanations. For example, perhaps Americans who exercise are more likely to feel more positive emotions, be of healthy weight, and therefore enjoy a healthier cholesterol profile.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from national data, only 3.6 per cent of the Japanese participants would have been obese, compared with 32 per cent of the Americans. With less variation in BMI in the Japanese sample, it would have been harder to spot any links between BMI and positive emotion. While the researchers argue that differences in cultural attitudes to positive emotion explain their data, more research is certainly needed to support their interpretation.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/non-smoking-2367409_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the European Union (EU), approximately 700,000 people die of smoking-related diseases every year. The reduction of tobacco consumption has thus become one of the major social policies of the EU.</p>
<p>The tobacco control policies (<a href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/en/">MPOWER</a>) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008 serve as a guideline for the health authorities of the EU member states. The six MPOWER measures mandate (i) increases in the tobacco tax; (ii) monitoring of tobacco usage; (iii) support for quitters; (iv) creation of a smoking-free environment; (v) warning against the dangers of tobacco; (vi) and banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.</p>
<blockquote><p>Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the MPOWER measures, taxation is the most common single policy tool to control tobacco use. Economic theory suggests that increasing tobacco taxes will result in higher direct costs for smokers and thus lower consumption.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the tobacco industry could absorb the additional costs to prevent higher retail prices, but, in reality, increased costs are passed on to the consumers. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption, while others switch to lower-priced products or turn to smuggled goods.</p>
<h3><strong>Modeling a 10% tax increase</strong></h3>
<p>In our study, we estimated the effects of a hypothetical cigarette price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and death toll of smoking in 28 EU countries.</p>
<p>Unlike previous studies, our statistical model also accounted for the fact that income affects the responsiveness of consumers to price changes. Research has shown that smokers with high disposable income are less affected by rising cigarette prices than those with lower income. In other words, the price elasticity of demand changes with income (income threshold effect).</p>
<p>The price elasticity of demand is used to measure changes in demand of goods in response to changes in price. It gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price.</p>
<p>Our statistical model separates the observed 28 countries into three income clusters (regimes), assuming that all of the countries within a cluster have about the same response patterns to price increases. Using data for the years 2005 to 2014, our model estimated the price elasticity of each income cluster.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on the elasticity figures, we were able to estimate the possible effects of a hypothetical price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and the number of averted smoking-attributable deaths. The latter figure derived from the simulated impact of price increments on the reduction in smokers and was adjusted for the fact that smoking cessation still carries considerable risks of early death.</p>
<p>The results of our study revealed that higher taxation would be considerably more effective in reducing consumption as well as incidences of smoking-related deaths in the two less developed regimes than in the remaining 24 countries (EU24) belonging to the third income regime. Specifically, nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.</p>
<p>Unlike other measures, such as bans on tobacco advertising, taxation not only effectively decreases tobacco consumption but, in general, also has the beneficial side effect of increasing national tax revenues. Our simulation showed that although tax revenues increased by 7.03% in Latvia and Poland, and by 3.15% in the EU24 area, revenues dropped by 1.41% in the least developed countries, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<h3><strong>Different policies for different countries</strong></h3>
<p>What are the policy implications? As the results of the study show, there are three income regimes among the observed 28 European countries. Since each regime is differently affected by cigarette taxation, different policies must be adopted to fight nicotine use. Specifically, other measures to control tobacco use, such as restrictions on advertisements, pictorial warning labels and cessation assistance, are necessary in high-income countries to compensate for the income threshold effect.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the study has shown, higher taxation leads to significant increases in tax revenues in high-income regimes, but in poorer countries it is more likely to lead to considerable losses in tax revenues. Health authorities in less developed countries may thus lack crucial funding to implement anti-smoking measures. External funding (donations from other European countries) would thus be required to ensure success in combating cigarette use.</p>
<p>Illicit trade of tobacco products has not been included in the study, as reliable data could not be obtained for all countries. Moreover, data on cigarette consumption analysed in this study refer to factory-made (FM) cigarettes. Roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco products have become popular in the EU in recent years and may influence consumption behavior. Further research on price effects may thus address the issue of illicit trade and RYO cigarette use.</p>

<p>A person diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia complains of serious memory problems, sometimes even forgetting who they are, without there being any apparent physical reason for their symptoms – in other words, their condition seems to be purely psychological.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating, controversial diagnosis with roots dating back to Freud’s, Breuer’s and Charcot’s ideas about hysteria and how emotional problems sometimes manifest in dramatic physical ways. Today, some experts doubt that psychogenic amnesia is a real phenomenon, reasoning that there is either an undetected physical cause or the patient is fabricating their memory symptoms.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/9/2498/4080831/Psychogenic-amnesia-syndromes-outcome-and-patterns">new paper</a> in <em>Brain</em>, a team of British neuropsychologists has reported their findings from a study of 53 patients diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia – one of the largest ever studies of its kind. Michael Kopelman at Kings College, London, and his colleagues conclude that the prognosis (that is, the scope and speed of recovery) for psychogenic amnesia is better than previously realised and that there appear to be four main categories of the condition.</p>
<p><span id="more-30107"></span></p>
<p>The patients with psychogenic amnesia had all been referred to St Thomas’s Hospital in London between 1990 and 2008, and the researchers compared their memory functioning and clinical history with 21 patients with memory disorders with a known physical cause (such as early stage Alzheimer’s or hypoxia), and 14 healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>The patients with psychogenic amnesia fell into four distinct categories. There were those who were in a <strong>fugue state</strong>, who had been wandering lost for days with no recollection of who they are or their past life. “I had a breakdown,” said one patient. “My brain decided to close down. I felt as if placed into a grown-up body without knowing the history of the body.”</p>
<p>Upon neurological examination, the fugue patients appeared healthy, and their state usually returned to normal within four weeks, though often sooner, and sometimes within hours. After recovery, most of their memories returned, except for a blank gap during the fugue state.</p>
<p>The second category was <strong>fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia</strong>. These patients started out in a fugue state – lost and usually with no or little memory of their past and no sense of identity – then as the fugue state resolved, they were left with more persistent memory loss for large periods of their past lives. Their memory gaps seemed to take longer to recover than the fugue patients (sometimes never recovering), though with a relative sparing of more recent memories.</p>
<p>The third category was <strong>focal retrograde amnesia</strong>. These patients had a severe loss of memory for large periods of their lives, or their entire lives, sometimes a temporary loss of identity, but there was no fugue period involving wandering. The onset was often a mild neurological event (such as a minor stroke) or minor head injury, but one “insufficient to account for the severity of the retrograde memory loss”. Similar to the fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia category, these patients’ memory loss was more prolonged than the fugue patients, but with a relative sparing of more recent memories.</p>
<p>And finally, some of the patients fell into a category the researchers called “<strong>gaps in memory</strong>” – they didn’t have a wandering period, loss of personal identity was also rare, and their one or more periods of memory loss were discrete, often tied to a specific traumatic experience (and often associated with PTSD).</p>
<p>At six months follow up, the fugue patients and to a lesser extent, the focal retrograde amnesia patients, showed good improvement. “In summary, the prognosis in psychogenic amnesia appears better than the previous literature suggests,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Comparing the psychogenic patients with the neurological and healthy controls, the psychogenic group were <em>more</em> likely to have suffered a past head injury (though not of sufficient seriousness to explain their memory problems); they were more likely to have a diagnosis of depression; to have a history of family or relationship problems, or employment problems; problems in childhood; and/or a history of alcohol or drug problems.</p>
<p>The finding that the psychogenic patients were more likely to have a history of head injury than the neurological controls is particularly surprising. Kopelman’s team said “this may predispose some individuals to developing psychogenic amnesia at a later time of severe precipitating crisis.”</p>
<p>A debate about psychogenic amnesia that dates back to Freud is whether the process of memory loss is deliberate or subconscious. Kopelman and his team observed that their findings were more consistent with there being a conscious, deliberate element to the condition (as first proposed by Freud and Josef Breuer, though Freud later changed his position). For instance, some of the patients in the new study made comments like: “It’s like a box locked away, and I don’t really want to open it” and “I put things in boxes … I know the memories are there … but cannot get access to them.”</p>
<p>The current thinking of Kopelman and others is that the deliberate memory suppression of psychogenic amnesia is often brought about by stressful crises in life, and that the deliberate forgetting manifests in genuine neurological processes that really do interfere with memory and even personal identity. Kopelman and his team conclude by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045208/">quoting</a> the Cambridge University psychologists Michael Anderson and Simon Hanslmayr: “Control mechanisms mediated by the prefrontal cortex interrupt mnemonic function and impair memory … We are … conspirators in our own forgetting.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/GhJUqw4RZoM/">Breaking memory circuits with marijuana</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PotBrain-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Paranoia. Munchies. Giggles. Sleepiness. Memory loss. Although the effects of cannabinoids–the active components of marijuana–are familiar to many, their neurobiological substrates are poorly characterized. Perhaps the effect of greatest interest to both neuroscientists and to cannabis users hoping to preserve their cognitive function, is short-term memory impairment that often accompanies marijuana use. Our partial understanding of its physiological and behavioral effects is not for want of studies into its neural effects. Ample research has shown a range of changes to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481526/" target="_blank">neurotransmission, receptors, ion channels and mitochondria</a> following cannabinoid exposure. However, knowledge of its cellular and molecular properties alone cannot offer a complete picture of its system-wide effects leading to cognitive and behavioral changes. A <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005624" target="_blank">recent study</a> published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> took a novel approach to address this issue, combining computational modeling with electrophysiological brain recordings from rats performing a memory task, to unravel the dynamics of neural circuits under the influence of cannabinoids.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabis impairs memory</strong></p>
<p>To assess memory changes induced by cannabinoids, the scientists injected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, into rats before they performed a “delayed-nonmatch-to-sample” working memory task. In this task, rats are cued with one of two levers, and after a delay, are required to select the opposite lever. Compared to sober sessions, performance under THC was impaired by 12%, confirming the all-too-familiar memory impairment associated with cannabis use.</p>
<p><strong>THC alters hippocampal activity</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified.png"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-19447" height="163" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified-300x163.png" width="300" /></a>The researchers focused on the hippocampus, a brain region essential for forming new memories, to examine how THC alters neural function underlying these memory deficits. The hippocampus has a characteristic circuit through three main subregions, whereby signal projects from the dentate gyrus to CA3 (via mossy fibers), and from CA3 to CA1 (via Schaffer collaterals). Although THC did not alter the mean firing rate in either CA3 or CA1, the researchers discovered more nuanced drug effects within hippocampal subregions. Neurons in the hippocampus are known to demonstrate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18284371" target="_blank">selectivity for particular stimuli</a>, and in this task, some neurons responded preferentially to lever presentations. After THC administration, this selectivity to lever presentation was reduced, suggesting that THC lowers information coding by the hippocampus. Further, theta power in CA1 was also reduced after THC administration.</p>
<p><strong>THC breaks the memory circuit</strong></p>
<p>While these preliminary results validate prior findings that cannabinoids disrupt traditional properties of neural activity, they do not speak to how THC modifies network-level signaling subserving memory. To probe functional circuitry, the researchers modeled intracellular and extracellular processes–such as refractory periods, potassium conductance or recurrent connections–contributing to CA3 to CA1 signaling. Memory deficits from THC correlated with both reduced feedforward excitation, and increased feedback excitation, along the CA3 to CA1 pathway. Modeling dynamic filters of this circuit, they further discovered that THC-induced memory impairments correlated with less feedforward theta and greater feedback theta-blocking from CA1. THC also reduced the number of CA3-CA1 connections, together suggesting that THC functionally isolates neurons from the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 subregions.</p>
<p>This study revealed a clear disruption by THC in the hippocampal circuitry supporting memory, though it didn’t directly examine what <em>causes</em> this functional breakdown. The brain possesses its own endocannabinoid system, which includes several cannabinoid receptors and endogenous endocannabinoids, which act on these receptors. In the drug-free brain, this system is involved in regulating functions such as mood, sleep, appetite, and of course, memory. Follow-up research will be necessary to clarify exactly how exogenous cannabinoids like THC wreak havoc on this system, but the authors speculate that THC may reduce feedforward excitation by activating CA3 CB1 receptors and reducing glutamate release, and increase feedback excitation by reducing CA1 interneuron output. Importantly, the authors emphasize, effects of cannabinoids on neural function aren’t one-size-fits-all. It’s likely that the brain’s excitation/inhibition balance depends on THC dose, leading to unique functional and behavioral changes under distinct drug conditions. Such differences in neural signaling dynamics, determined by drug dose and the targeted brain circuitry, could explain inconsistent reports of cannabinoids on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22019959" target="_blank">pro- and anti-convulsant activity</a>.</p>
<p>This study helps to fill a critical gap in our understanding, between the microscopic cellular and macroscopic whole-brain levels, of the ways in which cannabis impairs memory. The authors stress that “<em>in order to truly understand the effects of THC, one must study the systems level changes in circuit dynamics rather than taking a reductionist approach and studying the effects of THC on any particular receptor or cell type</em>.” By adopting the novel approach of modeling causal network dynamics, their research points to the breakdown of information flow along the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway as a major route of THC-induced memory disruption. As the researchers explain, their work “<em>is the first which examines the effect of THC on neuronal systems dynamics, or the causal interactions between signals, rather than on neuronal signals themselves</em>.” More research examining causal brain circuitry will eventually lead to a more complete understanding of the diverse ways in which cannabinoids alter behavior and cognitive function, from causing memory loss and sleepiness to giggles and munchies.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/20/why-forgetting-is-important-for-the-brain-functions/">Why is Forgetting Good for Your Brain and Health?</a></h4>

<p>The idea that forgetting is important for the proper functioning of the brain and memory may sound counterintuitive. However, forgetting is part of the process of memorizing, and it does not make us any less smart. Research shows that our brain has active mechanisms for forgetting. Both storing and losing memories are important for selecting and holding the most relevant information. Forgetting helps to get rid of outdated information. Forgetting the details also helps to generalize past experiences into specific categories and thus create appropriate responses to similar situations in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/20/deliberately-forgetting-memories-easy-for-some/">Forgetting</a> details helps us to remember what needs to be remembered. You cannot craft a good text without deleting and proofreading its parts. As the saying goes, it is the empty space between the notes that makes the music.</p>
<p>When we talk about forgetting in this article, we are not discussing forgetting related to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/14/prevention-is-the-best-medicine-for-dementia/">dementia</a> or any other neurodegenerative disease. We are talking about forgetting processes that take place in a healthy individual and are essential for the healthy working of the brain.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, our brain is bombarded with too much information. Most of this information is more like noise that interferes with our <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/01/the-neurology-of-anxiety-in-times-of-critical-decision-making/">decision-making</a> and reduces the clarity of thoughts. Something needs to be done with this unneeded information. Forgetting improves the flexibility of the brain by removing such outdated and unnecessary information. It also helps to streamline our memory by eliminating useless details and generalizing the concepts involved. The function of memory is not to simply pass information through time, but also to optimize future decision-making.</p>
<p>Forgetting has a special function in the memorizing process. Remembering things has a cost for<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/16/how-to-deal-with-destination-memory-issues-did-i-already-tell-you/"> memory</a>, thus forgetting irrelevant things is a cost-saving process. Our memory change is bi-directional. Some memories are made stronger, while others are either repressed or completely deleted. This makes the process of retrieving important information more efficient, as the brain uses fewer resources. Although forgetting may be frustrating, it has some fundamental benefits that aid our ability to remember.</p>
<p>Forgetting is also essential for our mental health. If this sound like an exaggeration, think about depression and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/24/how-does-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-change-the-brain/">post-traumatic stress disorder </a>(PTSD). Forgetting is essential for post-traumatic recovery. People with difficulties forgetting things are more prone to depression and psychological trauma. This is the reason why one of the key components of treating PTSD is memory repression or forgetting. Thus, the ability to forget can be used as a protective mechanism that helps to improve mental health.</p>
<p>Some researchers even believe that forgetting is related to ethics. If unjust thoughts continue to linger in your mind, they may finally result in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/05/04/are-humans-hard-wired-to-torture/">unethical actions</a>. Forgetting helps us to get rid of the wrong kind of thoughts and actions. Forgetting is important for leaving behind previously experienced humiliations and continuing on with pride. Forgetting helps us to move towards the future, leaving the past behind. Both memory and forgetting contribute to the continuation of life, allowing us to forget the anger and pains of the past.</p>
<p>Forgetting helps us to construct our life’s plot as we want. Without forgetting unnecessary things, we cannot create a design of our liking. We cannot tell a beautiful story without omitting some secondary details.</p>
<p>For proper balance in life, both conservation of memory and forgetting are important. Yoni Van Den Eede aptly wrote that: </p>
<blockquote><p>In this doubled Faustian bargain, we must ask ourselves towards which of the two sides we have been biased, and how we can reach a balance that combines enforcement with—consciously sought-after—limitations.</p></blockquote>
