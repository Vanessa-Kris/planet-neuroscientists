<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>There’s a huge amount of research into how people differ in their ability to learn things deliberately and “explicitly”, such as memorising a list of words or instructions, for example. Far less studied is “implicit learning”. Ask a five-year-old to explain the grammatical rules of their language and they’ll likely have no clue where to start. And yet, they do know them – or at least, well enough to form coherent sentences. This kind of unconscious acquisition of abstract knowledge is an example of “implicit” learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Implicit learning may be especially important for young children, but adults depend on it, too. It “is recognised as a core system that underlies learning in multiple domains, including language, music and even learning about the statistical structure of our environments,” note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719301313?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new paper</a>, published in <i>Cognition</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37510"></span></p>
<p>It’s been assumed that, as an evolutionarily primitive strategy for learning, there’s probably little difference between people in implicit learning ability. But, given that this is such a core system, with wide-ranging implications for our functioning in everyday life, there’s been astoundingly little research into whether this is in fact the case, or into how stable it might be across different kinds of relevant task. The new study fills some of these gaps, with a series of striking findings that have implications for our understanding of intelligence, as well as for who might be best-matched to what type of job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Priya Kalra at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues gave 64 healthy young adults four types of tasks that required implicit learning. One involved detecting an artificial grammar (after studying a series of letter strings that all adhered to undisclosed grammatical rules, the participants had to judge which strings among a new set were “grammatical” and which were not.) The second task required them to learn whether a particular group of images was going to trigger one outcome, or another (and they were given feedback to help them to learn). For the third task, they had to predict where a circle was going to appear on a screen, based on prior experience, during which the circle sometimes appeared in a predictable sequence of positions and sometimes did not. Finally, they had to learn visual categories implicitly: with the help of feedback, they had to classify abstract visual stimuli into one of two categories. (Explicit learning could have fed into some of these tasks, but the researchers made efforts to investigate, and take into account, its contribution for each individual.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One week later, the participants returned to complete different versions of all these tasks, as well as tests of working memory, explicit learning (they had to deliberately learn a list of words) and IQ.</p>
<p>For three of the four implicit learning tasks, the researchers found a “medium” level relationship between a participant’s initial performance and how well they did a week later. This suggests stability in implicit learning ability. The exception was the artificial grammar task; the researchers think it’s possible that explicit learning “contaminated” implicit learning in this task at the second time-point.</p>
<p>The team also found that how good a participant was at implicit learning bore no relation to their IQ or working memory results. It seems, then, to be driven by independent neural processes to those that underpin explicit learning, which <i>is</i> linked to IQ.</p>
<p>This finding fits with earlier work that has tied explicit and implicit learning to different brain regions and networks. (The hippocampus is important for explicit but not implicit earning, for example, whereas damage to the basal ganglia and cerebellum impair implicit, but not explicit, learning.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new results have implications for theories that intelligence depends upon a single fundamental factor, such as processing speed, the researchers write. “These data … provide evidence for the existence of a completely uncorrelated cognitive ability,” they added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings also imply that someone might feasibly be smart, as measured by an IQ test, but poorer at implicit learning than someone else with a significantly lower IQ score. For some real-world tasks, such as identifying only barely discernible hints of a tumour in a medical scan, a strength at implicit learning could be a big advantage, the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their findings also prompt a host of other important questions: Will the findings from this study also show up across a wider variety of tasks, and over longer time gaps between testing? Can implicit learning mechanisms be trained? How might explicit learning help or hinder implicit learning and subsequent performance? Earlier work led by Amy Finn, the senior author of this new study, has certainly suggested that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101806">a focus on explicit learning processes can “get in the way” of implicit learning</a>. It’ll be fascinating to see the results of follow-up research in this field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The device showed that harbor seals routinely reduced blood flow to their blubber, thereby slowing oxygen consumption, around 15 seconds before diving into water. This indicates the seals have conscious control over their dive reflex (previously thought to be a purely automatic response). </span></p>

The authors compared the flight characteristics of solo and paired pigeons making a 7km flight, and found that paired individuals had improved homing accuracy (which reduced the flight distance and time); the cost of this accuracy was an increase in speed and wingbeat frequency compared to solo fliers. The fact that pigeons are willing to pay this energetic premium underscores the importance of flocking together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Lucy Taylor adds: “The results of this study were completely unexpected. Energy is the currency of life so it’s astonishing that the birds are prepared to pay a substantial energetic cost to fly together.”</span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>When responding to science denialism (or, for that matter, any sort of false or harmful information), such as claims that vaccines are ineffective and harmful, it can be difficult to establish the right strategy. Because of the fast-paced way in which information spreads these days, there is a risk that responding to a given inaccurate claim can give it further oxygen, leading the falsehood to reach more people who are vulnerable to being misled, and so forth. There’s also the possibility of the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/">backfire effect</a>” – people who already endorse the false claims reacting to the debunking information by digging into their beliefs <i>further</i> (though there’s now <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/maybe-theres-some-hope-for-fact-checking-after-all.html">evidence</a> such fears were overhyped, and that the backfire effect may not be a regular occurrence overall).</p>
<p>To better understand when science-denialism debunking does and doesn’t work, Philipp Schmid and Cornelia Betsch, both of the University of Erfurt in Germany, ran a series of studies that involved online respondents being exposed to various sorts of science debates. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">results</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>, offer some useful insights about how to best stem the tide of science denialism.</p>
<p><span id="more-37496"></span></p>
<p>As the authors explain, there are two primary tactics used to rebut science denialism (and to argue in general): “An advocate can aim to overwhelm the opposing position by providing support only for her own view or she can aim to refute the opposing position by attacking its plausibility and explaining why it is wrong.” This is called a topic rebuttal. The other tactic is known as a technique rebuttal: The debunker can highlight the common techniques used by science deniers and show how a given argument fits in. For example, the claim that vaccines aren’t 100 per cent safe reflects a so-called “impossible expectation”, since no medical procedure is 100 per cent safe.</p>
<p>This chart from the study nicely lays out the differences between topic and technique rebuttals, with some examples:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_37497" style="width: 1936px;"><img alt="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.10.24.png" class=" size-full wp-image-37497 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="37497" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.10.24" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png" data-orig-size="1936,1034" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/07/10/researchers-conducted-six-studies-to-investigate-how-best-to-challenge-science-deniers/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11-10-24/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=845" />via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">Schmid &amp; Betsch, 2019</a></figure>
<p>The researchers ran six online experiments on almost 1,200 participants dealing with vaccines and climate change, in which they gauged success based on participants’ behavioural intentions and attitudes (either getting vaccinated or taking action to fight climate change, depending on the study, and attitudes towards those activities) before and after listening to, or reading a debate with, a science denier. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions where a science advocate was or wasn’t present to respond to the misinformation, and where the advocate used topic rebuttals, technique rebuttals, or both.</p>
<p>This figure runs down some of the key results:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_37498" style="width: 1420px;"><img alt="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.12.00.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37498" data-attachment-id="37498" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.12.00" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png" data-orig-size="1420,1124" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/07/10/researchers-conducted-six-studies-to-investigate-how-best-to-challenge-science-deniers/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11-12-00/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=845" />via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">Schmid &amp; Betsch, 2019</a></figure>
<p>Most importantly, “The results show that public discussions with a science denier have a damaging effect on the audience, as revealed by negative changes in attitudes and intentions [toward vaccination/ tackling climate change].” This negative effect was still present, though it was mitigated, even when a debunking advocate was absent. The researchers’ advice based on this rather disheartening outcome was that “advocates who take part in debates should not expect too much for their efforts — but that it’s still important to at least rebut science denialists when they show up or write in public forums.</p>
<p>Topic and technique rebuttals had the same mitigating effect and there was no evidence that using a combination of the two provided any additive benefit. On a positive note, the researchers found no significant evidence of a backfire effect in this context.</p>
<p>There are some important caveats here: This is an online study that didn’t track real-world behaviour, but rather self-reported attitudes and behavioural <i>intent</i>. As the authors themselves note, longitudinal studies looking at actual behaviour would be useful. But society is early on in understanding, in a scientific way, how persuasion works in this sort of context, and an investigation like this provides some firm early building blocks. Perhaps most importantly, it provides solid evidence that, from the point of view of concerned science advocates, if the choice is to show up to a debate with a science denialist or stay home, showing up is likely the better course of action – the only exception being if the advocate has the power to prevent the debate from occurring at all by abstaining.</p>
<p>But overall, people should temper their expectations about the efficacy of this sort of debunking: the authors argue that “facing deniers in public debates can be only one building block in the concerted effort to fight misinformation. Other recent approaches try to fight misinformation by pre-emptively providing laypeople with the ability to identify false information themselves.” At the risk of slipping into cliches about teaching a man to fish, it does feel like early, robust education on critical thinking and evaluating evidence could be more effective than trying to dislodge false beliefs one by one later on in life.</p>

<p>A newborn baby knows almost nothing about the world it comes into. To make sense of the onslaught of incoming sensory information, she or he must start to notice meaningful patterns and categorise them: that particular combination of visual data signifies a “face”, for example, while that noise is a “voice”. As the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12877">new paper</a> in <i>Developmental Science</i> point out, “without this fundamental categorisation function, our nervous systems would be overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of our experience.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It had been thought that infants form these categories using information from just one sense, whichever is the most relevant. Following this account, the category of “faces” results from an accumulation of visual information about what faces <i>look</i> like. However, an intriguing new study, involving four-month-old infants and their mothers’ smelly t-shirts, suggests that babies’ early acquisition of the faces category is a truly multi-sensory process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37483"></span></p>
<p>Arnaud Leleu at the University of Burgundy, France, led the research involving 18 baby girls and boys aged four months. Before the testing started, the babies’ mothers wore the same T-shirt for three nights in a row, keeping it in a hermetically sealed bag at all other times. They and their infants were then taken into a quiet, odour-free lab space where the babies were shown a series of images. Some were of faces against natural backgrounds, while the majority featured animals, plants and manufactured objects. Each image was presented for only 167 milliseconds (less than a quarter of a second), meaning that perception had to happen at a glance.</p>
<p>Some of the time, the babies had their mother’s odorous T-shirt placed on their upper chest. (The T-shirt was folded so that the maximally-smelly underarm, breast and neck regions were closest to their nostrils.) Other times, they had a clean, unworn T-shirt placed near their noses. Throughout the experiment, the researchers used EEG (electroencephalography, which measures electrical activity via electrodes on the scalp) to monitor how the babies’ brains responded to the images.</p>
<p>The results were clear: the babies’ face-related brain activity in response to the images of faces was significantly greater when they could smell their mother’s well-used T-shirt at the same time, compared with when their mother’s odour was not present – suggesting that the odours strengthened their recognition of faces. The results provide strong support for the idea that multi-sensory, rather than single-sense, inputs drive our acquisition of categories, the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Some earlier research findings lend support to this idea, in relation to faces, at least. Whenever you look at a face, neurons in a region of the visual cortex called the fusiform gyrus respond with a burst of activity (leading researchers to label this the “fusiform face area”). However, in 2009 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005987">a study</a> showed that the smell of body odour, without any visual input, can also trigger activity in the fusiform gyrus. A region that had traditionally been thought to be responsive only to visual data is clearly receptive to other sensory signals when they indicate that a face is likely to be in the visual scene.</p>
<p>It makes sense that babies use odours to help them to spot faces, the researchers add. Odours are less fleeting than many visual stimuli, and of course body odours tend to co-occur with the appearance of a face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new work prompts many questions. Do babies rely more on smell than adults in their rapid recognition of faces? Does it matter to babies if the odour is their mother’s, or could it be someone else’s? (Only maternal odour was used in this study.) Which constituents of the body odour are most important for the effect? Do babies use smell to help them to form other “visual” categories? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also make this important point about the way that infant research is usually conducted: “Given that much evidence about visual categorization in infancy, and about virtually every neurocognitive process, has been obtained through testing infants seated on their parents’ lap, future studies should examine whether and how such parental sensory context, including body odour, mediates infants’ processing abilities.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Conference-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h4>One major event in the world calendar of rheumatology</h4>
<p>Scientists, patients, rheumatologists and other health professionals met at the IFEMA Centre to discuss recent advances in research and care in the diagnosis and treatment of RMDs. Sunny Madrid is a popular destination for rheumatologists having hosted EULAR on three out of the last seven editions of the conference. Despite the routine focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other topics have shone in recent years, including co-morbidities, patient engagement, and digitalisation in diagnostics and care.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11113" style="width: 257px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11113" height="329" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-returns-to-Madrid-225x300.jpg" width="247" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR returns to Madrid</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<h4>Memorable talks attended</h4>
<p>Checkpoint inhibitors, compounds that improve survival in multiple cancers, concurrently increase numbers of adverse immune events. These <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/76/10/1747" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">include incidences of rheumatoid arthritis</a> as soon as one month after the start of treatment. <a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/david-stephen-pisetsky-md-phd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Pisetsky</a> and <a href="http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Medizinische-Klinik-und-Poliklinik-IV/de/Ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/oberaerzte/Schulze-Koops_Hendrik/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Henrik Schulze-Koops</a> discussed the impact of these medications on B and T immune cells, respectively. Both debated whether these treatments might be uncovering latent forms of rheumatism in patients through modulation of various immune subtypes. Beth Helmink followed up by explaining the importance of the microbiome in mediating checkpoint treatment, as exemplified by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0238-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faecal transplants in immuno-deficient mice significantly boosting cancer treatment success</a>.</p>
<p>Comorbidities with RMDs were once again at the center of attention at this year’s EULAR. Despite increased awareness of comorbidities amongst rheumatologists, some reported to me that a lack of communication between specialist clinicians and scarcity of resources prevent adequate treatment of multiple conditions. This critical issue was covered in <em>BMC Rheumatology’s </em>recently published Thematic Series “<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Comorbidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comorbidities in rheumatic diseases – from clinical to translational approaches</a>”.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11115" style="width: 381px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11115" height="247" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-village-300x200.jpg" width="371" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR village for exhibitions and posters.(Courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/EULAR_Press" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EULAR Press Office</a>)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>One impressive example of these comorbidities was reported by <a href="https://www.univaq.it/rubrica.php?id=395&amp;perstecnamm=on" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Piero Ruscitti</a> whose team found that remission in patients with RA was associated with an 80% drop in the incidence of negative cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>“Cannabis for the joints?” is how <a href="http://www.iasp-pain.org/AboutIASP/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serge Perrot</a> concluded his benefit-risk analysis of treating arthritis with cannabinoids, thus generating a wave of smiles amongst delegates. Alongside <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/davidfinn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Finn</a> and <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/expertiseguide/life-sciences/dr-stephen-alexander.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Alexander</a>, they established a discussion on the history, science, and ethics of cannabis given the current grey-zone clinicians face. Current knowledge indicates that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that medical cannabis is a viable treatment for rheumatism, although use in pain, insomnia, and anxiety may be reasonably considered on a patient-by-patient basis.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging trends in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders</strong></p>
<p>Interactive poster tours were a new addition to EULAR 2019, whereby selected presenters were given three minutes to introduce their poster in front of a screen and 20+ delegates with some time afterwards for questions. I attended as many as I could, and I was particularly impressed by the advances in musculoskeletal imaging methods. Chaired by <a href="http://www.haematologie-onkologie-bonn.de/doctor/dr-med-mudr-valentin-schaefer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Valentin Schafer</a> and <a href="https://www.rheumazentrum-ruhrgebiet.de/home/wir/ansprechpartner.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xenofon Baraliakos</a>, advancements in technologies such as machine learning and algorithms to better diagnose rheumatic conditions were well explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11116" style="width: 372px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11116" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Presenter-300x224.jpg" width="362" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A presenter uses the new interactive poster format to illustrate their work for an on-looking crowd</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It is in this context that both <a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a><em> &amp; </em><a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> will run a cross-journal collection on advances and challenges in imaging musculoskeletal disorders until the end of 2019.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient engagement in research and development was definitely a recurring theme throughout this conference</p></blockquote>
<p>Digitalization has additionally enabled more effective communication between health care professionals and patients. For example, Susanne Karlfeldt (Karolinska Institute, Sweden) spoke of Stockholm City Council’s development of personalized, e-health solutions for patients. She outlined how mobile/web applications and regular communication between clinical, patient consultants, and patients can streamline consultation periods and improve patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>Patient engagement in research and development was a recurring theme throughout this conference. One of EULAR’s main activities and related advocacy in coming years will be to increase participation in its work with patients of RMDs. The push to ensure that research and clinical practice is geared towards the needs of patients, as well as involving them more, is something that EULAR and the general scientific community is beginning to consider more seriously. This even more evident by the sessions dedicated to People with Arthritis and Rheumatism in Europe (PARE), which featured a mix of researchers, rheumatologists, and patient advocacy groups such as <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arthritis Foundation</a> and<a href="https://oafifoundation.com/en/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Osteoarthritis Foundation International</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect conditions for exchanges of knowledge and ideas</strong></p>
<p>The open interactions between the different partners that comprise EULAR/PReS – scientists, health professionals &amp; patients – was great to see. I believe that this exchange of ideas could, and should, be applied more to other research fields, including my own background of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Space was also given to a series of sessions for individual groups. One of the most productive is the <a href="https://emeunet.eular.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EMEUNET</a> (Emerging EUlar NETwork) working group, who provide both educational and entertaining events for the young-at-heart involved in rheumatology.</p>
<p>Weather and hospitality conditions were ideal in Madrid for EULAR 2019, and it is easy to see why the rheumatology community keeps coming back again and again. <em>BMC </em>will attend EULAR 2020 in Frankfurt (3 – 6 June), something this field and journals can look forward to in anticipation.</p>

<p>The UK population continues to grow, while nursing numbers have remained static for several decades. Compounding matters, The King’s Fund and Nuffield Trust have <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/the-nhs-workforce-in-numbers%236-how-did-we-get-to-this-situation">reported</a> a 25 per cent increase in nurses and midwives leaving the NHS from 2012 to 2018, from 27,300 to 34,100. In short, in the UK, we now have far fewer nurses relative to the general population than we used to.</p>
<p>What does this mean for patients’ care experience? The situation sounds bad, but how bad? Common sense would suggest that patients will experience poorer care when nurses are overstretched, and there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to support that interpretation. But there are also positive stories, and claims about greater efficiency compensating for fewer staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/early/2019/03/27/bmjqs-2018-008948.full.pdf">study</a> in <i>BMJ Quality &amp; Safety</i> provides direct observational evidence suggesting that lower nurse-patient ratios really do result in poorer health-care interactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37461"></span></p>
<p>Jackie Bridges at the University of Southampton and her colleagues observed how patient-staff interactions varied across six NHS physical healthcare wards in England depending on the ratio of nursing and healthcare assistants to patients. In total, the researchers carefully rated 238 hours of care, which included over 3000 interactions between 270 patients and healthcare staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, 10 per cent of those interactions were rated as negative – specifically “negative restrictive”, such as patients being moved without warning or sworn at; and “negative protective”, such as patients having to wait for medication. Crucially, the researchers found that the odds of a negative interaction increased significantly as the number of patients per registered nurse increased.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lower numbers of registered nurses working on a ward were associated with more negative interactions regardless of whether or not healthcare assistants (support staff without a nursing qualification) had been brought in to make up the numbers. Having more healthcare assistants on shift only helped if there were enough registered nurses to supervise them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As this was a purely observational study, rather than experimental, some caution is required, as the authors note: “a causal inference [about staffing levels] cannot be directly made”. Nevertheless, this is such a helpful piece of research, that’s clearly consistent what nurses have been saying for years: that they need enough of them on shift to be able to ensure that patient care is high quality.</p>
<p>This isn’t to “do down” healthcare assistants, who are undervalued enough, but it is highlighting the importance of good quality supervision. It also doesn’t mean that nurses go round looking over the shoulders of their more junior colleagues, but is consistent with the argument that patient-carer interactions will be more universally positive when there are sufficient nursing staff to deal with queries, show more junior staff what to do, talk through dilemmas, model excellent patient care, and acknowledge difficult feelings that caring roles can bring up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study reminded me of the time I’ve spent working in mental health wards, a job which was adrenaline-fuelled and unpredictable but which I loved, and where I worked with brilliant nursing colleagues who were often rushed off their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Media coverage of care quality in the NHS often blames individuals, and especially nursing staff, for failures. Poor care is never excusable or acceptable, but it is important to recognise that there are perfect storms of working condition which make it more likely. Negative cultures in organisations, lack of staff resources, destructive leadership, can all play their part.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150407084231/http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">The Francis Report</a>, published in 2013, highlighted the devastating effects of a lack of compassionate care and the need to have cultures where people feel they can speak out about poor care, and where compassionate care is supported. Much has been done since to <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/05/five-myths-compassionate-leadership">champion compassionate leadership and compassionate care</a>, but this new study shows how, in the aftermath of austerity and with not enough staff to go round, it’s harder for these principles to be put into practice. For any of us – nurses included – if we are stressed, tired, under emotional pressure and not given enough time, we tend to behave less nicely. It’s not news that <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Darley-JersualemJericho.pdf">a lack of time has a negative impact on caring behaviours</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s been much about staff wellbeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/nhs-forced-prioritise-staff-wellbeing-tackle-escalating-crisis">in the papers recently</a>, with initiatives to offer mindfulness, yoga, exercise classes and the like. Interventions on an individual level can be hugely helpful and useful to know about. At the same time, it’s not good enough to offer interventions to reduce unnecessary stress caused by an uncaring system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>High quality compassionate care in hospital settings requires sufficient nurses to deliver the care and to supervise their junior colleagues. Anything less is setting up staff to fail and setting up patients for a greater likelihood of negative care. Nurses need to be cared for too, by their employer and by their colleagues, and a bare minimum is making sure there are enough colleagues on shift for it to feel safe. This new research adds to a body of evidence that takes the blame off the nurse and squarely places the responsibility on the system to do better.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to learn a foreign language, I was living in an Italian suburb of Sydney. My hour a week at a local Italian class was inevitably followed by a bowl of pasta and a few glasses of wine. As an approach to language-learning goes, it was certainly more pleasurable than my German lessons at school. Despite the wine, it was also surprisingly effective. In fact, getting better at a new language doesn’t have to mean hard hours on lists of vocab and the rules of grammar. It turns out that what you <i>don’t</i> focus on matters, too. And a glass of wine may even help …<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37458"></span></p>
<p><strong>Listen to the language, even if you don’t have a clue what’s being said – and you’re not even paying close attention</strong></p>
<p>One challenging aspect to learning a new language is that it may contain distinct speech sounds that, as a non-speaker, you can’t even tell apart. This isn’t a problem for young children – they only need to spend time around the new language to learn to hear the different sounds, simply through passive exposure. It’s long been thought adults can’t do this, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918321542">a study published in 2019</a> brings a more optimistic message and has implications for the best approach to adult language learning.</p>
<p>The researchers asked native Finnish-speakers to listen to Mandarin speech sounds while engaged in other tasks, and to do this for two hours a day on four consecutive days. Critically, even when they were instructed to ignore the sounds and focus on a silent movie, recordings of their brain waves (via EEG) suggested they were getting better at differentiating between the different Mandarin speech sounds. “For the first time, these results demonstrated that mere passive exposure to sounds can induce plastic changes related to change detection in the adult human brain, which was previously thought to happen only in infancy during the sensitive period,” the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>The researchers added that this suggests passive training may help real-life language learning. They recommend listening to a language you want to learn while you’re doing something else (as long as it’s not too cognitively demanding) – while working out at the gym, or while cooking, perhaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A passive approach to learning could also be especially beneficial to older adults in the context of remembering new vocab. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612457386">A 2013 study</a> led by Lynn Hasher at the University of Toronto showed that older adults have a greater tendency than younger adults to process distracting information. While this isn’t usually helpful, it does make them more likely to remember background information. This suggests that after a session of deliberately learning new vocab, hearing those words played in the background could help with learning.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t try too hard with the grammar</strong></p>
<p>Not only can children easily perceive the difference between a vast range of speech sounds, but they learn the grammar of a language more easily than adults too. It used to be thought that this advantage ends at about the age of seven. However, again the picture has become more optimistic of late. For instance, in 2018, a team involving Steven Pinker at Harvard University concluded that in fact, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994">the advantage lasts about a decade longer</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once we reach adulthood though, it does become harder to get to grips with grammar and also the structural components of words in another language.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the problem could be that adults’ more highly developed cognitive skills work against them. Consider a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101806">2014 study</a> by Amy Finn at MIT and colleagues that found the harder adults worked at the structure and use of units of an artificial language – such as root words, suffixes and prefixes – the worse they did. To learn this language “morphology”, “at least in this artificial language we created, it’s actually worse when you try,” Finn comments.</p>
<p>These findings supported a theory, put forward in 1990 by the linguist Elissa Newport, that adults struggle with this aspect of language-learning because they try to analyse too much information at once. So what can you do? If you’re listening to another language, don’t over-analyse it, Finn suggests. There was a condition in her study in which some of the participants had to complete an undemanding puzzle or do some colouring while they listened to the artificial language – and it’s telling that it was this group who performed best at acquiring the new grammar. It’s hard not to conclude that if you act like a child, maybe you’ll learn as effectively as a child, too…</p>
<p><strong>Choose the right time of day – or night – to learn</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Outside more formal educational settings, a lot of language classes tend to take place in the evenings, but it’s worth considering experimental findings that suggest this isn’t an optimum time for everyone, especially older people and teenagers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For example, in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/a0037243">2014 study</a>, Lynn Hasher and her team found that older adults (aged 60-82) were better able to focus, and tended to do better at memory tests, between 8.30am and 10.30am, compared with 1pm and 5pm. Scans of their brains suggested this was because by the afternoon, their “default mode network” was more active – a neural state indicative of daydreaming. Among young adults, however, other neural networks more associated with focused attention remained active into the afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Evening learning probably isn’t ideal for teenagers either. In <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040963">a study published in 2012</a>, Johannes Holz at the University of Freiberg, and colleagues, found that 16- and 17-year-old girls performed better on tests of factual memory if they’d learned the material at 3pm than at 9pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">published in Psychological Science in 2016</a>, suggests that evening learning can be beneficial – especially if you follow it with a decent night’s sleep, and a follow-up session the next morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>French-speaking participants were split into two groups: one learned the French translations of 16 Swahili words in the morning, returning for a second booster session that evening; the others learned the translations in the evening with a booster session the following morning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The group that learned the vocab in the evening, slept and then studied again the next morning out-performed the other group on all kinds of memory tests. The overnight group showed virtually no forgetting after one week (unlike the same-day learners, who’d forgotten, on average, 4-5 of the translations), and by the second session, they’d forgotten less than the same-day learners and were quicker to re-learn anything that they hadn’t remembered.</p>
<p>The researchers suspect that sleep soon after learning allowed for a greater consolidation of these memories than for the other group. The results suggest that scheduling two study periods, one for close to bed-time, the other soon for after waking, is an effective way to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Take long breaks</strong></p>
<p>The idea of taking as long a break as possible between learning some vocab and revisiting it sounds counter-intuitive. However, it’s worth considering a phenomenon called the “spacing effect” when planning your study schedule.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/25/the-secret-to-remembering-material-long-term/">research published in 2007</a> by Doug Rohrer and Hal Pashler, you should aim to time the intervals between learning something and revising it based on when you’ll <i>really</i> need to recall it (for an exam, say, or a holiday) following a 10 per cent rule – i.e. you should space your revision periods at intervals of roughly 10 per cent of the total time you’d really like to retain those memories. If you’ve got a test coming up in a month, say, then you should revise what you learn today in about two or three days’ time. But if you want to remember something over the longer term, so that your performance peaks in a year’s time, then it’s sensible to revisit that information once a month. Why this rule should work isn’t clear, but it’s possible that having long gaps between learning, revision and retrieval tells your brain that this is knowledge you’ll be coming back to, so it’s worth holding for the long term.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The 10 per cent rule is only a rough guide, though. More recent research suggests the spacing effect works best when it is adapted to each individual’s progress. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613504302">In a study</a>, published in 2014 in <i>Psychological Science</i>, Pashler and his team devised individual spacing plans for middle school pupils learning Spanish, based on the material’s difficulty level and how well the students did on early tests. They found that these individualised plans boosted test performance at the end of a semester by 16.5 per cent, and led to 10 per cent better scores than the “one-size-fits-all” 10 per cent spaced study plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other research has backed up this counter-intuitive idea that, rather than being detrimental, taking a long break from a language that you’re learning might actually be beneficial. A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032974">study published in 2012</a> involved 19 people becoming proficient at speaking and comprehending an artificial language and then taking a three- to six-month break. Michael Ullman at Georgetown University and his team found that the group did just as well in grammar tests after this break as they had done right after first learning the language. In fact, after the break, their brain activity while processing the language looked more like the kind of activity you see when native speakers are processing their first language. Ullman thinks taking a lengthy break from an already learned second language can help the representation of the language to shift from a form of “declarative memory” to “procedural” – akin to playing an instrument or riding a bike. This was a small study involving an artificial language so more research is definitely needed, but as the researchers noted, their findings have “potentially important consequences for second language acquisition”.</p>
<p><strong>Have a drink…</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol is not exactly known for its brain-boosting properties. It impairs all types of cognitive functioning, including working memory and the ability to ignore distractions. So you’d think it would make it harder for someone to speak in a foreign language. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/10/moderate-alcohol-consumption-improves-foreign-language-skills/">a study published in 2017</a> by Fritz Renner and colleagues found that it doesn’t – if anything, it can be beneficial.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>German volunteers learning Dutch who’d drunk enough vodka to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.04 per cent (approximately equivalent to just under a pint of beer for a 70kg male) were rated by independent Dutch speakers as speaking the language more proficiently during a short-test (they had to argue in Dutch for or against animal testing), compared with the other participants who’d only drunk water beforehand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why? Perhaps because some people feel anxious when talking in a foreign language, and this was ameliorated by the alcohol. However, as Renner cautions: “It is important to point out that participants in this study consumed a low dose of alcohol. Higher levels of alcohol consumption might not have [these] beneficial effects.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A highly acclaimed neuroscientist whose work offered hope for many patients with brain injury has fallen from grace.



Niels Birbaumer. From https://www.wysscenter.ch/person/niels-birbaumer-phd/



Prof. Niels Birbaumer, of the Eberhard-Karls University of Tübingen in Germany, came under investigation earlier this year. The probe began after researcher Martin Spüler raised serious concerns over a 2017 paper in PLoS Biology by Ujwal Chaudhary et al. Birbaumer was the senior author.

<p>Can we predict who will receive a telegram from the Queen?</p>
<p>Are centenarians grown-up versions of the exceptionally resilient ‘dandelion children’ I’ve described in<a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/seven-common-sense-building-blocks-for-your-childs-brain/"> previous articles</a>?</p>
<p>Is longevity simply a case of good genes?</p>
<h2>Can we predict which child will live till 100?</h2>
<p>When writing my book, I put these questions to Professor Richie Poulton, head of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study.</p>
<p>And Poulton told me,</p>
<blockquote><p>It is quite obviously evident!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re not familiar with this great kiwi contribution to the world you can learn more <a href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Dunedin Study has closely charted every detail the lives of 1000 people born in the mid-70s in Dunedin, New Zealand. The cohort is now entering middle age, and Poulton believes he already has a fair idea who will be blowing out 100 candles on their cake.</p>
<p>Poulton and his team have measured the pace of biological ageing in his 1000-strong cohort. Biological ageing is estimated by charting the “coordinated decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems” including 18 biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, lung, liver, kidney, renal, immune, and dental health.</p>
<p>Across 12 years, 18 biomarkers were measured at three time-points when the cohort members were aged 26, 32, and 38. Despite being in their 40s and still being too young to have age-related disease, clear patterns emerged.</p>
<blockquote><p>From ages 26 to 38 we see increasing differentiation between groups in terms of their physical health and mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on their pace of ageing scores three groups were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>an average group who experienced one year of physiological decline per each calendar year.</li>
<li>a fast-ageing group who experienced more than twice this rate of change</li>
<li>a slow-ageing group who experienced almost no change at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Poulton’s team then chose six personal-history characteristics already known to be linked to poor health and mortality:</p>
<ul>
<li>familial longevity</li>
<li>childhood social class</li>
<li>adverse childhood experiences</li>
<li>childhood health</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>self-control.</li>
</ul>
<p>As he writes in a 2017 report in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28401731/"><em>Aging Cell</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Study members with shorter-lived grandparents, who grew up in lower social class homes, who experienced more adverse childhood events, who had poorer childhood health, who scored lower on IQ tests, and who had poorer self-control all showed evidence of accelerated biological aging during their 20s and 30s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poulton predicts,</p>
<blockquote><p>The fast-ageing group is going to enter the second half of their life in bad shape and get worse … We need to start looking at ageing younger than you might think because therapies will need to be delivered by midlife in order to make a difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>He tells me the great sadness of his life is knowing he’ll won’t live long enough to see if his predictions come true.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll be pushing up daisies by then,</p></blockquote>
<p>he says.</p>
<h2>Key characteristics of those who live the longest</h2>
<p>Of course, not all centenarians or slow-agers are alike and personal histories are unique. The <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) team has found their cohort varied widely in years of education (no years to post-graduate), socioeconomic status (very poor to very rich), religion, ethnicity, and patterns of diet (strictly vegetarian to extremely rich in saturated fats).</p>
<p>However, centenarians in Sydney, New England, and Okinawa share a few key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re nearly always lean.</li>
<li>They rarely smoked</li>
<li>They’re better able to buffer stress than most people.</li>
<li>Women have a history of bearing children after the age of 35 or even 40 years.</li>
<li>At least half have exceptionally old siblings and other relatives.</li>
<li>Children of centenarians also show delays in disease onset.</li>
<li>Score low on personality traits of neuroticism, and high on optimism and purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is extreme longevity is genetic?</p>
<p>Exceptional longevity clearly runs in families — the children and siblings of centenarians are healthier, have a more favourable “biological signature”, and they age slower. Tellingly Jeanne Calment‘s brother Francois (who died age 122, to date the oldest living human ever) lived till the age of 97). But as Jeanne said,</p>
<blockquote><p>God didn’t want there to be two hundred-year-olds in the same family, so it fell to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Members of the Okinawan Centenarian Study team believe its both nature <em>AND</em> nurture.</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the Okinawans have both genetic and non-genetic longevity advantages — the best combination — the dietary habits, the physical activity, the psychological and social aspects, all play an important role in Okinawan longevity.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We all have the genetic capability to live to at<em> least</em> our 80s.</h2>
<p>As the NECs team explain, this makes sense in the context of results from the study of Seventh Day Adventists at Loma Linda University who live eight to 10 years longer than the average American.</p>
<p>As a group, they tend to be vegetarian, non-smokers, physically fit, and they spend a lot of time with their families and with their church group. Plenty of Americans make nearly the opposite health choices and as a consequence die younger.</p>
<blockquote><p>What the Seventh Day Adventist results also show us is that the average American has the genes to reach their mid-late 80s, they just need to take very good care of themselves with proper lifestyle choices.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p><em>This is part 3 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<p>As father to an 18-month-old toddler, I would love to know exactly what my son is thinking. Along with many parents, one of the ways I try to find out is to ask him questions of the variety “Do you want X or Y?” But does his answer to this type of question actually reveal his preference or is it a more a reflection of a quirky cognitive bias that is more powerful in children than adults?</p>
<p>Two competing effects influence how adults respond to binary choices. The first is called “The Primary Effect” which describes the way that the first option we hear tends to stick in our minds. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773285">one study</a> found that adults are more likely to choose “heads” when asked if a coin toss is going to be “heads or tails”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second effect, which sometimes contrasts with the Primary Effect, is called “The Recency Effect”. This captures the way that the last thing we hear or experience can also have more weight in our memory (this is why popstars end their concerts on their best songs, so that everyone leaves thinking the whole gig was great). In adults, neither the Primary Effect or the Recency Effect is always the more pronounced, with evidence suggesting that one’s personality type, familiarity of the information, and how controversial the topic is, all play a mediating role.</p>
<p>Keen to test if the same is true in young children, or if one of the effects is more dominant, a team led by Emily Sumner conducted two experiments and published their findings in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217207">a recent paper</a> in <i>PLOS One</i> fantastically titled “Cake or Broccoli: Recency Biases Children’s Verbal Responses”.</p>
<p><span id="more-37438"></span></p>
<p>In the first experiment, they asked twenty-four toddlers a series of questions with two options for them to consider (i.e. “Should Rori bring a lunchbox or backpack to school?”). Later, after enough other questions had been asked to mask the repetition, the order of these options were flipped (i.e. “Should Quinn bring a backpack or a lunchbox to school?”). When answering verbally, which they usually did, the toddlers chose the second option 85.2 per cent of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, when the toddlers pointed to their preference instead of saying them, they chose the second option only 51.6 per cent of the time. It would appear that there is something about saying the answer that accentuates the Recency Effect. Further analysis of the data revealed that the Recency Effect was more powerful among younger toddlers (18-24 months old) compared with the older ones (24-48 months), suggesting its impact diminishes the older the children get, as they become more rational and logical.</p>
<p>In their second experiment, the researchers explored why the Recency Effect is so pronounced in young children. To do this, they had twenty-four 3-to-4 year olds choose names for different toys. Some of the options were one-syllable names (i.e. “Should we name this toy ‘Stog’ or ‘Meeb’?”) whereas others were longer (“Should we name this toy ‘Shallop’ or ‘Bingle?”). This went all the way up to four-syllable names. The researchers found that the longer the word was, the more likely the children were to choose the second of two options. The researchers speculated that the longer names placed more of a burden on children’s limited working memory capacity, resulting in the latter of the two options being fresher in their mind and therefore more prominent. This partially explains why the younger children in the first experiment acted on the Recency Effect more, as their working memory capacity is even more limited at that age.</p>
<p>This study has implications for both researchers in education and parents. For researchers, a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>popular way to assess young children’s comprehension and development is to have them do tasks which involve making these sort of fixed-choice decisions. However, as the authors of this study note, their findings “suggest that some of children’s earliest utterances may be the result of a recency bias, and do not necessarily indicate that the child comprehends the words they speak”.</p>
<p>For parents keen to gain an insight into their child’s thought processes and understand them better, it would probably pay dividends to vary the order of choices they give them. By ensuring that the same option is not always second, it will probably help them deduce what their child really prefers. Another effective strategy would also be having their child point to which of the two options they want, as this helped combat the recency bias in this study. Cunning parents could also consider exploiting the Recency Effect to encourage their child to express an apparent preference for a healthier option over the other. Perhaps if I do this, I can get my own toddler to eat more broccoli and less cake.</p>

update that soon also. Still <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=S%3A+Needs+packaging">quite a queue for us to work through</a>,
but we're making steady progress!</p>

After her lawyers threatened Linköping whistleblower Jaywant Phopase, accusing him of slander and demanding money, regmed researcher May Griffith wrote to me. She sent me a whole dossier: all misconduct findings against her were overruled, even in court.  Turns out, ethics dumping is good and anyway, she is not responsible for her own publications.

We don’t know how another person perceives the outside world: the color of the ocean, the sound of the waves, the smell of the seaside, the exact temperature of the water. Even more obscure is how someone else <i><b>imagines</b></i> the world in the absence of external stimuli. Most people are able to generate an internal “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/" target="_blank" title="mental representation">representation</a>”<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> of a beach — to deploy imagery — when asked, “picture yourself at a relaxing beach.” We can “see” the beach in our mind’s eye even when we’re not really there. But no one else has access to these private images, thoughts, narratives. So we must rely on subjective report.<br /><br />The hidden nature of imagery (and qualia more generally)<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span>  explains why a significant minority of humans are shocked and dismayed when they learn that other people are capable of generating visual images, and the request to “picture a beach” isn’t metaphorical. This lack of imagery often extends to other sensory modalities (and to other cognitive abilities, such as spatial navigation and autobiographical memories), which will be discussed another time.

This very blog forms a large part of a newly published study on research methods blogs in psychology. The paper has a spicy backstory.







Back in 2016, psychologist Susan Fiske caused much consternation with a draft article which branded certain (unnamed) bloggers as being “bullies” and “destructo-critics” who “destroy lives” through “methodological terrorism.”



Fiske's post (which later appeared in a more moderate version) was seen as pushback against bloggers who criticized the robustne

<p>In 2015, I retired from the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> and presented an exit seminar titled “Career Reflections of a 1970s Feminist,” using my experiences of training and working in medicine and psychiatry from 1975 to 2015 to highlight women’s issues. Afterward, I was surprised by discussions with current women psychiatry trainees, who said that not much had changed in terms of their work experiences.</p><p>This was shocking and sad. Many women who campaigned during the 1960s assumed that inequalities would melt away when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equal Pay Act 1970 were enacted on 29<sup>th</sup> Dec 1979. Instead, throughout 2018 there has been a deluge of media coverage about gender inequalities and sexual harassment.</p><p>The Women’s Movement has a long history dating back to the fifteenth century or before and gathering momentum in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I have in my ancestry two pioneering intellectual women, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-116">Margaret Fuller</a> (1810-1850) and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-82?rskey=st5dzI&amp;result=1">Frances Willard</a> (1839-1898), who were part of the Women’s Movement in America. In those days, their priorities were education and suffrage. They would have been disappointed to think that 200 years later, women were still suffering inequalities. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage">1893</a>, New Zealand became the first country in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. The two World Wars later opened spaces for women to excel outside their domestic spheres.</p><p>Women (and men) have made great strides in this arena, but something has stalled since enactment of our discrimination and equality laws. The immediate response is to gather data and draw up policies and protocol. But these have not worked in the past, so why expect the same process to produce different results next time? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/fawcett-staff">Sam Smethers</a>, CEO of the Fawcett Society, talks of “push back.” Historians of feminism talk about <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth">waves</a> (which implies troughs too). Others talk of “undercurrents” or “stealthy factors,” or instruct in survival strategies such as “leaning in.”</p><p>We do not know why such inertia exists in our social structures. Perhaps ethological (observation of animal behaviour) research in our organisations is the place to start. How do people, men and women, behave in our institutions and why is the resistance to change so strong?</p><p>Consider these three scenarios:</p><p><strong>1. Cauliflower cheese portions:</strong></p><p>This is familiar to many women. You go to the canteen at work with male colleagues and the kindly serving staff dish out your cauliflower cheese. As a woman, mine was often smaller than that of the male doctors I dined with. Portion control was not equal. We paid the same. We were all happy—the men get a good dollop of lunch, I got plenty for my needs and the kindly staff had done their jobs well. But it was not equal. Is it a problem? Is it so much part of our indoctrinations that it is usually invisible? Is this just a clear and amusing example of many, more insidious inequalities that perpetuate gender differences in our social settings? Verdict: More research needed.</p><p><strong>2. Surfing </strong></p><p>It is becoming apparent that women doctors work harder than many men doctors and get paid less. How did that happen when the UK has a national contract? There is focus on clinical awards, who gets extras, career effects of working less than full-time, gender differences in academic medicine, and so on, but ethological research could give insights here too. Consider this stereotyped scenario: male consultant, any specialty, his secretary may make him tea or coffee, hang up his coat, prepare clinic, tribunal, and lecture materials, have letters ready for signing, manage his diary, etc. His team will usually be fully staffed and his operating theatres have their quotas of assistants. What of this happens for his woman colleague? Are more staffing gaps found in teams with women consultants? Who does the extras such as on call rota planning, extra teaching, and pastoral care? Close analysis of the ways institutions support men and women employees differently may show that while men get help to surf the waves, women get ballast and smaller surfboards. Again, more research needed.</p><p><strong>3. Witch hunting </strong></p><p>Something happens in the treatment of women employees as they get older. Just at the stage when they are likely to have fewer domestic commitments and more time available for work, their wisdom and skills seem less valued. At this stage, there seems to be a culling of older women and a stacking up of older men at the hierarchy pinnacles. Some people’s testimonies seem difficult to believe initially, until one considers witch hunting. Why did witch hunting—a gendered phenomenon that defied logic–evolve in some societies in the past, and by which medusa tentacles is such group-think or bias evident now? Why do our social systems need this sort of group behaviour, who initiates it, who perpetuates it, and who benefits from it? More research needed.</p><p>Psychiatry is not the only space in which women are silenced or burdened, but as a discipline it’s one lens through which we can analyse a larger phenomenon. Now more than ever, it’s essential to discuss, in real time, women’s experiences as health professionals and as patients in mental health services. Too often women have been silenced and the gender gap in scientific publications is one example of this. As I edited the essays for this book, I was constantly overwhelmed by their quality, integrity, and content, and so inspired by my wonderful women colleagues.</p><p>Featured image credit: “Medical hospital hallway” by Foundry.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Stress has complicated effects on our memories. Whereas some studies have found that we are better at remembering events that occurred during stressful situations, <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/32/10111%23sec-22">such as while watching disturbing videos</a>, others have shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742709001993">stress impairs memory</a>. Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262618301969">a study</a> published in <i>Brain and Cognition</i> suggests that stress doesn’t influence the strength of our emotional memories at all. Instead, the researchers claim, it is the fidelity of those memories – how distinct and precise they are – that changes when we go through stressful experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37420"></span></p>
<p>Maheen Shermohammeda from Harvard University and colleagues recruited 56 young adults between 18 and 23, and asked them to view a series of negative and neutral pictures. That might seem painless enough – except that half of the participants looked at the pictures while feeling rather stressed. Before they began looking at the pictures, they were told that they would later have to give a speech to a panel of judges. To make matters worse, before seeing each block of pictures they had to complete complicated maths problems. They were given just a short time to complete these, and while doing so they were told that they were performing poorly and their data would be unusable if they didn’t do well. In contrast, the control group had a fairly relaxing time: instead of a speech, they were told they would have to write a story, and they only had to complete simple maths problems at their own pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>About two weeks later, all the participants were given a surprise memory task, in which they again saw the earlier pictures alongside new images they hadn’t seen before. They had to indicate whether each picture was an old one that had been in the original task or a new image they hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>At several points throughout the study, all participants were asked how stressed they were, and also had their heart rate measured and saliva samples taken to analyse levels of the stress hormone cortisol. As expected, the group that went through the stressful experience reported higher levels of stress, and had increased heart rates and cortisol levels (although the team had to exclude a handful of participants who, surprisingly, didn’t report feeling stressed).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, participants in both groups were better at remembering negative images – this replicates a well-established finding that emotional material tends to be more memorable. Also, the stressed group correctly remembered just as many of the earlier images as the control group<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(i.e. their “hit rate” was the same). Crucially, where the groups differed was in their patterns of “false alarms” – how often they falsely remembered new images as being from the original task. The stressed participants were more prone to false alarms for negative images compared neutral images, and the more stressed they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>were, the larger this difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The control group didn’t show any difference between the two kinds of images.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the researchers suggest it’s not the strength of our memories that is influenced by stress, but rather their fidelity, or how distinct they are from other information. For the stressed group, neutral memories became more distinct, making it easier to distinguish them from new neutral material, while negative memories were more vague or blurred, making it harder to distinguish them from new negative material. The results demonstrate the importance of separating out memory into its constituent parts (strength and fidelity), the researchers add, rather than just looking at overall performance or correct “hits”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a rather preliminary result. The pool of participants was small to begin with, and made even smaller after the researchers had to remove those participants who didn’t respond to their stress intervention. And the participants all came from a very young, narrow age range, raising the question of whether older people respond in similar ways.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea that stress has different effects on different components of memory is an interesting proposition that deserves further attention – particularly as understanding memory during periods of stress has important real-world implications for situations like eyewitness accounts of crimes. For example, the researchers said, a “stressed witness to [a] crime … may indeed have a strong recollection of the criminal, but may also have an impoverished ability to discriminate the assailant from other individuals in a police lineup.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/06/ORCID-Reviewer-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/10/collaboration-improves-recognition-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PLOS authors have used </span><a href="https://orcid.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to make their professional lives easier. Now reviewers at PLOS can take advantage of the same benefits to track their contributions, claim credit, and build up their research profiles.</span></p>
<p><b>Same ORCID, now for reviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting today, reviewers can enter their ORCID iD in the Editorial Manager submission system for all PLOS journals and opt-in to automatically get credit when they complete a review, the same way they would for their published articles. The ORCID reviewer record does not contain details about the specific manuscript and we’ve introduced a delay, so reviewers can track their work even while retaining their anonymity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to record more types of work is especially important for researchers who are working to build up their scholarly reputation. For those who are getting ready to apply for funding or a new position, credit for reviews helps demonstrate the full breadth of their contributions to the field.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>“We thank PLOS for partnering with ORCID to provide their reviewers the opportunity to get credit for their critical contribution to the research ecosystem.”</p>
<p>– Laure Haak, Executive Director of ORCID.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><b>More ways to get credit = more reasons to review</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewers’ contributions to the publication process are essential. They are working researchers who give their time and expertise to help authors improve their work and help editors decide when a manuscript is ready to become part of the permanent scientific record. But recognition for reviews often flies under the radar, in part, because tools for tracking these contributions without compromising anonymity may not be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year we rolled out options for signed and published</span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Combined with ORCID, we aim to give reviewers the tools and opportunities to claim credit for their reviews in a way that works for them.</span></p>

<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID is a persistent unique identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers with the same name and sticks with you throughout your careers. Even if you change your name, switch institutions, or move to another country, all of the contributions tracked by your ORCID are still identifiable and attributable to you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have an ORCID iD, you can sign up on the</span><a href="https://orcid.org/register"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, follow the instructions on our <a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid#loc-how-to-get-started">site</a> to link your iD to your Editorial Manager profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your ORCID is linked, you can opt-in to automatically alert ORCID anytime you complete a review. For each new review, you’ll get a message with the option to post the citation to your ORCID record. Click “authorize” to start tracking your contributions.</span></p>

<p>It’s a trick that politicians have long exploited: repeat a false statement often enough, and people will start believing that it’s true. Psychologists have named this phenomenon the “illusory truth effect”, and it seems to come from the fact that we find it easier to process information that we’ve encountered many times before. This creates a sense of fluency which we then (mis)interpret as a signal that the content is true. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of course, you might like to believe that your particular way of thinking makes you immune to this trick. But <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n7bze/">according to a pre-print uploaded recently to PsyArXiv</a>, you’d be wrong. In a series of experiments, Jonas De keersmaecker at Ghent University and his collaborators found that individual differences in cognition had no bearing on the strength of the illusory truth effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37408"></span></p>
<p>The researchers wondered whether three aspects of cognition, already known to influence how people make judgments, could determine how prone someone is to the illusory truth effect: cognitive ability or intelligence; the need for cognitive closure (i.e. the desire to avoid ambiguity); and cognitive style (whether someone thinks in a rapid and intuitive manner or takes a slower and more analytic approach). For example, someone who relies more on intuition and wants hard-and-fast answers might be more likely to use the fact that information has been repeated as a cue to its truthfulness.</p>
<p>Across six experiments involving between 199 and 336 participants, the team measured the illusory truth effect while also tapping into these aspects of cognition. The exact methods varied for each study, but generally participants would first read a mix of true and false trivia statements, then complete various cognitive tests and surveys, and finally they would re-read and judge as true or false the earlier trivia statements, as well as new ones interspersed among them. A seventh study was similar but involved fake and real political headlines (the participants’ final challenge in this case was to judge which were real and which were made up).</p>
<p>The researchers found the illusory truth effect across all seven studies: participants were more likely to rate trivia statements and headlines as true/real if they’d seen them previously. Crucially, the strength of this effect did not vary according to the participants’ cognitive ability or style, or need for closure. (A couple of studies found some small significant associations, but these disappeared when the researchers integrated all the data.)</p>
<p>These results suggest that we are all predisposed to believe repeated information regardless of our own particular cognitive profile. And while that might make us all susceptible to advertising and the fabrications of dishonest politicians, the researchers have a more optimistic take. “These novel findings are in line with the assertion that processing fluency is not a judgmental bias and flaw in the individual, but rather a cue to truth that is universal and epistemologically justified in most contexts”, they write. In other words, it’s not that there’s a foolish subgroup of people who are more vulnerable to the “illusory truth” effect, but rather it’s an advantageous and universal bias that’s arisen because most of the time fluency actually <i>is</i> a reliable signal of truth. For example, a statement that is often repeated may tend to be endorsed by more people, which could be a useful cue to its truth.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual differences relating to the illusory truth effect waiting to be discovered, the team adds. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, seem to show a less strong effect, suggesting that certain fundamental aspects of memory and cognition may be required to support the effect. With a greater willingness to publish null results like this one – and not just leave them in the file drawer – researchers should be able to build up a much more complete picture of the illusory truth effect and other cognitive biases.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>You may be best advised not to read this article late at night or before you eat. Psychologists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Charles University in the Czech Republic have surveyed a large sample of non-clinical volunteers to gauge their reaction to 24 creatures that are commonly the source of specific animal phobias.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12409">published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em></a>, not only contribute to our understanding of animal phobias, but could prove incredibly useful to horror writers. Among the key findings is that spiders were unique in being both intensely fear- <em>and</em> disgust-inducing in equal measure. The researchers said this may be due to their mix of disgusting properties – including their “quirky ‘too-many-legs’ body plan” – combined with the fact they are “…omnipresent in our homes, often lurking in the hidden dark places and capable of fast unpredictable movement.” In other words, the intense fear arises in part from the prospect of coming into physical contact with a creature perceived by many to be revolting.</p>
<p><span id="more-37399"></span></p>
<p>Jakub Polák and his team recruited nearly 2000 people online and asked them to rate how frightening and disgusting they found 25 creatures, including – alongside the spider – a snail, dog, bull, maggot, cockroach, two kinds of snake (a viper and a grass snake), and ant. See the image above for the full list.</p>
<p>Depicted in photographs on-screen, this particular selection of species – aside from the red panda, which acted as a non-fear-inducing control – was chosen because they are frequently the source of animal phobias.</p>
<p>Categorising the creatures based on the levels of fear and disgust that they elicited, the researchers identified five groupings: fear-relevant, non-slimy small animals, such as cockroaches, ants and wasps; mouse-like animals, such as mouse, rat and bat, which scored low on elicited fear and disgust; snakes and lizards; parasites, such as lice and tapeworm, which triggered high disgust; and finally, farm or pet mammals, such as cat, dog and horse, which generally elicited low fear and disgust.</p>
<p>One explanation for common animal phobias is that they reflect an exaggerated, uncontrolled form of innate fears for certain creatures that we all share, particularly for creatures that imperilled our ancestors, such as spiders and snakes. Consistent with this evolutionary account, spiders and venomous snakes elicited the strongest fear reactions among the participants, while parasites elicited the strongest disgust reactions (consistent with the idea that disgust motivates a form of protective “behavioural avoidance”). However, less consistent with the evolutionary perspective on animal phobias is that 14 of the creatures elicited virtually no fear, including rats, mice and lizards, even though these animals are commonly the source of phobias.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that, similar to spiders, the parasitic creatures like tape-worm and roundworm were both highly disgust-inducing (even more than the spider) while at the same time being rated as highly fear-inducing (even more than, say, the wasp or grass-snake). <span>Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, this combined fear and disgust reaction to intestinal parasites has evolved because they infect us with microscopic larvae meaning we rarely see them with our eyes, yet we are aware they are omnipresent. Once again, as with spiders, we cannot rely only on disgust (and behavioural avoidance) to protect us, and so we also fear unwanted physical contact. The maggot, by contrast, may elicit less fear because it can be seen and avoided more easily.   </span></p>
<p>Some other details to emerge from the study are that women generally gave higher fear and disgust ratings than men, and especially for non-slimy invertebrates and repulsive human parasites – this may be in line with evolutionary theory because “women as a sex with higher reproductive cost need to be extra careful of pathogens threatening not only their health but also the [health] of their children.”</p>
<p>Also, the researchers asked their participants about any past traumatic experiences with animals, such as being seriously bitten by a dog or scratched by a cat. Surprisingly perhaps, they found that fear ratings were <em>lower</em> among people with such a bad experience in their past. However, this correlation makes sense if you consider that people with a greater fear of animals may be be more cautious and less likely to get hurt. “Our results … suggest that fear and disgust could protect subjects against harm even in our modern environment,” the researchers said. In excess, fear can be debilitating and unwelcome, but this last result is perhaps a reminder that it is also there to serve a purpose – including to protect us from the creatures that may bite us while we sleep or infect us from within.</p>

Such advanced cognitive skills require a big brain to process complex information, and a long phase of development to observe others, learn skills, and acquire social and manual tools. Essential ingredients facilitating this life style are time, parental support – and iodine.</p>

<p>Iodine is a rare mineral which is critical for development, health, and reproduction in modern humans. It is reasonable to assume that it was equally important for our ancestors. Given that normative human development depends on iodine, it is thought that expansion of brain tissue, its structural differentiation, and the related social and cognitive skills that emerged during human evolution were contingent on enhanced intake of iodine.</p>
<p>Rich sources of iodine can be found in coastal areas. It is for this reason that researchers consider such habitats as crucial for the emergence of “human” traits. Adapting to a diet of sea food, weeds, and salt water has boosted brain growth and fueled other physiological systems that control nutrition, development, and maturation. This raises the question of how organisms which became used to the unlimited intake of “brain food” were able to migrate away from the coast and invade habitats that are deficient of iodine such as continental forests, mountain areas, and dry savannas.</p>
<p>Fossil evidence demonstrates a steady increase in brain size which is suggestive for sufficient iodine intake. But what sources did our ancestors use to meet their enhanced nutritional requirements. One way to obtain this information might be to look at apes, humans closest living relatives and study their food habits. Many of them live in areas that have been occupied by prehistoric human populations and one can infer that our ancestors relied on the same food sources that make up the diet of contemporary wild ape populations.</p>
<p>The diets of bonobos (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) and chimpanzees (<em>P. troglodytes</em>) show some remarkable similarities to that of humans: Both species feed on leaves, herbs, and a variety of energy rich plant foods such as fruit pulp and seeds. Some populations dig for roots and other underground organs, extract honey from tree holes, and consume the meat of other vertebrates. While many populations of bonobos and chimpanzees inhabit areas considered to be iodine deficient compared to human standards, there is good reason to assume that sources of environmental iodine used by wild apes are sufficient to prevent the detrimental effects of iodine deficiencies that affect humans and nonhuman primates.</p>

<p>Although research on diet composition and feeding behavior of bonobos, chimpanzees and other apes have been investigated in great detail, the intake of iodine remains virtually unknown. The first data on this topic are available in a recent study published by<em> BMC Zoology</em>. Alerted by the behavior of wild bonobos at the research site of LuiKotale in the Democratic Republic of Congo, researchers from the Center for Research and Conservation (Antwerp), the Max-Planck-Society (Leipzig), and John Moores Liverpool University, launched a project to investigate the reason for the use of aquatic terrain by the otherwise terrestrial apes.</p>
<p>The continental part of the Congo basin is considered as a region where natural sources of iodine are scarce and where humans depend on supplementation of iodine. However, the results of this study show that the Congo basin is not devoid of natural sources of iodine <em>per se</em> and that some species of aquatic herbs contain iodine concentrations that are equivalent to those of marine algae (a substantial source of iodine). Bonobos and other apes are well known to use aquatic food sources and the results of our study suggest that iodine may be the driving force for this behavior. Projecting back towards the time of human migration across the African continent, populations moving into the Congo basin would have found sources of iodine to support the lives and health of migrants that were primed by the rich sources of coastal habitats.</p>
