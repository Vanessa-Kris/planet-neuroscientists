              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alaska-yukon-delta-visualization-climate-change-land-transition">A stunning visualization of Alaska’s Yukon Delta shows a land in transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The westward journey of the mighty Yukon River takes it from its headwaters in Canada’s British Columbia straight across Alaska. The river has many stories to tell, of generations of Indigenous people hunting on its banks and fishing in its waters, of paddle-wheeled boats and gold panning and pipelines.</p>



<p>Where it meets the Bering Sea, the river fans out into an intricate delta resembling cauliflower lobes of river channels and ponds. The delta has a story to tell, too — that of an increasingly green Arctic.</p>



<p>A composite image of the delta’s northern lobe, taken May 29 by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat 8 satellite, shows willow shrublands lining river channels as they wind toward the sea. Farther inland, tussock grasses carpet the tundra. Grasslike sedge meadows populate low-lying wetlands, punctuated by ponds left behind by springtime floods along the riverbanks from snow and ice that have melted upstream.</p>



<p>In southern Alaska, such as in the Kenai Peninsula, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">the Arctic has been getting noticeably greener</a> since the 1980s, as global temperatures climb (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). Researchers observed this change using satellite measurements of red and near-infrared light reflected off the vegetation. Now, analyses of changing vegetation in the Yukon Delta and nearby Kuskokwim Delta show that<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/aop/EI-D-20-0025.1/EI-D-20-0025.1.xml"> more northern areas are getting greener too</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Earth Interactions</em>.</p>



<p>The increasing prevalence of tall willows, an important moose habitat, is one sign of these changes in the delta. Moose populations, too, are on the rise. But for the Yukon and other Arctic deltas — where higher floodwaters due to climate change are likely to deposit thicker sediment piles, supporting more greenery — many more changes are likely to come as the planet warms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781635574944">Wild Souls</a><br><em>Emma Marris<br>Bloomsbury, $28</em></p>



<p>On the Arctic Ocean’s fringe, polar bears stand on ice thinning from human-caused climate change. Without thick ice from which to powerfully pounce on seals, many of these symbols of the wild north can’t eat.&nbsp;Should we feed polar bears to right our wrongs? Or should we leave them alone, even if that means they starve to extinction?</p>



<p>Emma Marris’ <em>Wild Souls </em>prompts readers to grapple with this question and more. An absorbing and nuanced blend of philosophy and science, the book explores what we owe the nonhuman world. Like her 2011 book <em>Rambunctious Garden</em>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-rambunctious-garden-saving-nature-post-wild-world-emma-marris">challenged the notion</a> of “pristine wilderness” in a world where humans touch everything (<em>SN: 9/23/11</em>), <em>Wild Souls </em>questions the very concepts of wildness and nature. The result challenges readers to reconsider how they relate to nonhuman animals, from caged creatures to polar bears in the warming north.</p>





<p>Marris guides readers through a series of case studies, from Indigenous hunting practices to municipal zoos, all brought to life through attentive on-the-ground reporting. Running through these examples is a central ethical tension: How do we weigh the tangible moral value of an individual sentient creature who can suffer against the more abstract value of species or ecosystems, which are of course unfeeling but rouse such depths of emotion in us when they are threatened or lost?</p>





<p>Islands are a front line of this conflict, where life that’s blossomed in isolation is threatened by species we’ve introduced. Marris examines efforts, from the Galápagos to New Zealand, to kill (often painfully with poison) millions of individual mice, rats and other creatures in the name of preserving species deemed more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marris is frank on where she stands on certain issues, arguing, for example, that zoos are immoral. She also asks whether it’s ever right to save a species like the California condor — which once soared above most of North America but dwindled to just a handful of individuals in the 1980s — by caging them for captive breeding.</p>



<p>The book makes a clear case for the moral value of individual sentient creatures, providing a rundown of the latest science that dissolves the distinct line often drawn between humans and nonhumans. These include studies that suggest fish feel pain and that rats help fellow rats in need because they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscience-mice-may-catch-each-others-pain-relief-contagious">experience emotions</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Defining the objective, inherent value of species proves trickier. “There’s something precious in what we call ‘nature,’ in the flow of energy, in the will to survive,” she writes. “But I cannot present overwhelming arguments that this is true. I can only passionately assert it.”</p>



<p>In the end, Marris finds no set formula for making ethical choices about animals’ fates. Instead, readers may realize something profound: There are no perfect ways to act ethically toward all animals and all species when incommensurable values collide. As we try to mend the mess we’ve made of nature, all we can do is act with thoughtful humility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Threadlike filaments pressed in rock <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabf3963">may be the remnants of archaea</a> that burped methane near hydrothermal vents 3.42 billion years ago. &nbsp;If so, these strands in rock excavated in South Africa around a decade ago, would provide the earliest direct evidence of a methane-based metabolism, researchers report July 14 in <em>Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth’s early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life. &nbsp;Scientists suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">life on our planet</a> could have arisen in such an environment (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Biologists have deduced that metabolisms based on munching or belching methane evolved early on, but don’t know exactly when, says Barbara Cavalazzi, a geobiologist at University of Bologna in Italy. Previous research has found indirect evidence for methane-cycling microbes in the chemistry of fluid-filled pockets of ancient rocks from around 3.5 billion years ago. But that work didn’t find the actual microbes. With this fossil analysis, “what we find, basically, is evidence of about the same age. But this is a cellular remain — it’s the organism,” Cavalazzi says.</p>



<p>The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. That shell is different structurally from the preserved interior, suggesting a cell envelope enclosing the cells’ insides, the authors write. And the team found relatively high nickel concentrations in the filaments. The concentrations were similar to levels found in modern methane-makers, suggesting the fossils’ metal may come from nickel-containing enzymes in the microbes.</p>





<p>“They can attribute a specific metabolic lifestyle to these early microorganisms,” says Dominic Papineau, a Precambrian biogeochemist at University College London, who was not part of the study and calls it “brilliant work.”</p>



<p>Yet the search for early life-forms has had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-fossil-biomorphs-more-common-ancient-rocks-real-fossils">its share of false signs</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>) , and some researchers aren’t convinced these fossils are the real deal. In silica-rich hydrothermal environments, the ingredients for structures that mimic cells mingle and can form life look-alikes through chemistry, says Julie Cosmidis, a geobiologist at the University of Oxford. “They fossilize better than actual cells, so I think it could very well be what those things are,” she says, pointing out that nickel, common in the early Earth, clings easily to organic matter, whether it’s living or not. “We don’t understand enough [about] the processes that can create false biosignatures,” says Cosmidis, whose lab studies such questions.</p>



<p>But Cavalazzi and her colleagues contend that the different lines of evidence together support the living origin of the microfossils. Papineau also notes that “the evidence is very good,” but adds that it’s “not necessarily rock solid.” Other tests could strengthen the case for the earliest methane-using microbes, he says.</p>



<p>If the strands are ancient archaea, they’d become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago. And if such microbes evolved so quickly on Earth, within around 1 billion years of the planet’s origin, methane-cyclers may be more common than realized on other planets where liquid water has been around for a while, Papineau says.</p>



<p>This fossil comes from a time when Earth’s planetary ecosystem was likely very different than it is now, says Boris Sauterey, a paleoecologist at the University of Arizona in Tempe, who wasn’t involved with this study. Back then, Earth most likely shared similarities with some of the extraterrestrial worlds that we today would consider potentially habitable, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers looking for signs of early life on Earth have explored sediments of surface waters more than hydrothermal systems, where these fossils were found, Cavalazzi says. The discovery suggests, she says, that here and on other planets, researchers should keep scratching below the surface.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>During the pandemic, many of us were locked down with little face-to-face contact with anybody other than our partners. Considering the stress of the time and the intensely close quarters we were in, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a recipe for serious tension.</p>



<p>A new study, however, suggests the reality might not be so cut and dry. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506211022813">Writing in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em>, </em>a team led by Lisa A. Neff from The University of Texas at Austin found that the pandemic actually played an important part in people’s ability to deal with stress. When couples blamed their levels of stress on the pandemic, the team found, they were happier in their relationship.</p>



<span id="more-43014"></span>



<p>Participants were people living with their partner during the lockdown in the United States, who completed daily measures for 14 days during the April lockdown and then again seven months later (almost all couples were heterosexual, though several participants were non-binary).</p>



<p>In each questionnaire, participants indicated on a scale from one to five how much they blamed themselves, their partner, and the pandemic for their current levels of stress or problems. Next, participants were presented with eleven different parts of their life, from work to finances to household chores, and were asked to indicate how stressful or problematic that element of life had been that day. They also completed measures of relationship satisfaction, and indicated whether they had performed any negative behaviours towards their partner (e.g. criticising or directing anger towards their partner, or acting withdrawn or distant).</p>



<p>During both waves of the study, participants on the whole were more likely to blame the pandemic for feelings of stress than they were themselves or their partners. And blaming the pandemic seemed to be beneficial for their relationships, at least for the female participants: on days they found particularly stressful, women who blamed the pandemic for the stress reported greater satisfaction in their relationship than those who did not. They also reported behaving in fewer negative ways towards their partners, again suggesting that the act of blaming the pandemic acted as a buffering force in romantic relationships.</p>



<p>For female participants, the pandemic seemed to act as a “scapegoat”, as the team put it, which can protect relationships from undue stress. The team suggests that stress “spillover” — the spilling of external stressors like work into a relationship — was lessened due to heightened stress awareness and ability to blame a massive global event which was a very obvious source of stress. (Of course, it’s important to remember that many people <em>have</em> struggled with their relationships during the pandemic, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/16/im-grateful-for-our-intense-lockdown-split-what-has-the-pandemic-done-to-our-relationships">in some cases</a> the unique combination of factors thrown up by coronavirus really was a recipe for divorce.)</p>



<p>This spillover was also positioned as a reason why women participants were more likely to benefit from blaming the pandemic than men. Other research has suggested women experienced more distress during the pandemic, as well as more dissatisfaction with the allocation of tasks at home and their work-life balance. Women may therefore be more vulnerable to stress spillover — and this could be why they benefited more from blaming the stress on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Future work could look at periods of more intense stress. Although the pandemic as a whole was stressful for many, most participants in this study were experiencing low levels of stress on a daily basis; the daily diary method may also have felt labour intensive for those experiencing high levels of stress, leading them to drop out.</p>



<p>People may also have been blaming their stress on the pandemic precisely because it was caused by the pandemic: it’s not hard to imagine, for example, that stress and bad feelings have been triggered by pandemic-induced job insecurity, concerns about vulnerable relatives, or the monotony of lockdown. If that’s the case, it’s not a huge surprise that participants were happier in their relationship on days they blamed the pandemic — because there might not be anything wrong with their relationship to begin with.</p>



<p>On the whole, however, the findings suggest that relationships can thrive — or at least survive — when couples are aware of stress and feel able to discuss it openly: advice that probably holds outside of a pandemic as much as it does in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-death-physics-electromagnetism-standard-model">With Steven Weinberg’s death, physics loses a titan</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mythology has its titans. So do the movies. And so does physics. Just one fewer now.</p>



<p>Steven Weinberg died July 23, at the age of 88. He was one of the key intellectual leaders in physics during the second half of the 20th century, and he remained a leading voice and active contributor and teacher through the first two decades of the 21st.</p>



<p>On lists of the greats of his era he was always mentioned along with Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann and … well, just Feynman and Gell-Mann.</p>



<p>Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science. He exuded intelligence and dignity. As news of his death spread through Twitter, other physicists expressed their remorse at the loss: “One of the most accomplished scientists of our age,” one commented, “a particularly eloquent spokesman for the scientific worldview.” And another: “One of the best physicists we had, one of the best thinkers of any variety.”</p>





<p>Weinberg’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/">Nobel Prize, awarded in 1979</a>, was for his role in developing a theory unifying electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. That was an essential contribution to what became known as the standard model of physics, a masterpiece of explanation for phenomena rooted in the math describing subatomic particles and forces. It’s so successful at explaining experimental results that physicists have long pursued every opportunity to find the slightest deviation, in hopes of identifying “new” physics that further deepens human understanding of nature.</p>



<p>Weinberg did important technical work in other realms of physics as well, and wrote several authoritative textbooks on such topics as general relativity and cosmology and quantum field theory. He was an early advocate of superstring theory as a promising path in the continuing quest to complete the standard model by unifying it with general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity.</p>



<p>Early on Weinberg also realized a desire to communicate more broadly. His popular book <em>The First Three Minutes</em>, published in 1977, introduced a generation of physicists and physics fans to the Big Bang–birth of the universe and the fundamental science underlying that metaphor. Later he wrote deeply insightful examinations of the nature of science and its intersection with society. And he was a longtime contributor of thoughtful essays in such venues as the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p>



<p>In his 1992 book <em>Dreams of a Final Theory</em>, Weinberg expressed his belief that physics was on the verge of finding the true fundamental explanation of reality, the “final theory” that would unify all of physics. Progress toward that goal seemed to be impeded by the apparent incompatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the math underlying the standard model. But in a 1997 interview, Weinberg averred that the difficulty of combining relativity and quantum physics in a mathematically consistent way was an important clue. “When you put the two together, you find that there really isn’t that much free play in the laws of nature,” he said. “That’s been an enormous help to us because it’s a guide to what kind of theories might possibly work.”</p>



<p>Attempting to bridge the relativity-quantum gap, he believed, “pushed us a tremendous step forward toward being able to develop realistic theories of nature on the basis of just mathematical calculations and pure thought.”</p>



<p>Experiment had to come into play, of course, to verify the validity of the mathematical insights. But the standard model worked so well that finding deviations implied by new physics required more powerful experimental technology than physicists possessed. “We have to get to a whole new level of experimental competence before we can do experiments that reveal the truth beneath the standard model, and this is taking a long, long time,” he said. “I really think that physics in the style in which it’s being done … is going to eventually reach a final theory, but probably not while I’m around and very likely not while you’re around.”</p>



<p>He was right that he would not be around to see the final theory. And perhaps, as he sometimes acknowledged, nobody ever will. Perhaps it’s not experimental power that is lacking, but rather intellectual power. “Humans may not be smart enough to understand the really fundamental laws of physics,” he wrote in his 2015 book <em>To Explain the World</em>, a history of science up to the time of Newton.</p>



<p>Weinberg studied the history of science thoroughly, wrote books and taught courses on it. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-looks-back-rise-scientific-method"><em>To Explain the World</em></a> was explicitly aimed at assessing ancient and medieval science in light of modern knowledge. For that he incurred the criticism of historians and others who claimed he did not understand the purpose of history, which is to understand the human endeavors of an era on its own terms, not with anachronistic hindsight.</p>



<p>But Weinberg understood the viewpoint of the historians perfectly well. He just didn’t like it. For Weinberg, the story of science that was meaningful to people today was how the early stumblings toward understanding nature evolved into a surefire system for finding correct explanations. And that took many centuries. Without the perspective of where we are now, he believed, and an appreciation of the lessons we have learned, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/physicists-story-science-breaks-historians-rules">the story of how we got here “has no point.”</a></p>



<p>Future science historians will perhaps insist on assessing Weinberg’s own work in light of the standards of his times. But even if viewed in light of future knowledge, there’s no doubt that Weinberg’s achievements will remain in the realm of the Herculean. Or the titanic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">What experts know so far about COVID-19 boosters for immunocompromised people</a></h4>

              
                <p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852">organ transplant recipients</a>, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lucky enough to have access to shots</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259776v1">twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised</a>, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus</a> and prevent severe disease (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0282">boosted the antibody levels</a> of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861">had detectable antibodies after a third dose</a>, researchers reported June 23 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01594-4/fulltext">stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses</a> of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.21259913v1">half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab193/6289996"> 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients</a>, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in <em>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">How do scientists calculate the age of a star?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">Turns out it was just a phase</a>.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">magnetically active</a> compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806">can give astronomers ballpark estimates</a>. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



<h3>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams</h3>



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram"> plot stars’ temperature against their brightness</a>. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>

<h3>Rotation rate</h3>



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...171..565S/abstract">propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age</a>: Rotation rate = (Age)<sup> -½</sup>.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



<h3>Stellar seismology</h3>



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler space telescope</a>. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">collided</a> with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age</a> as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">NASA’s TESS</a> and the European Space Agency’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-new-mission-to-investigate-exoplanets-has-rocketed-into-space"> CHEOPS</a> survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">A partial skeleton reveals the world’s oldest known shark attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/jomon-genes">Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/97</em>) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002777">places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago</a>, the researchers report in the August<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A roughly <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/caribarch/education/sharks/">1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico</a> previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

                <p>This month's episode features Mark Humphries, author of "<a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo">The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds."</a> We explore how the brain uses electrical signaling in surprising ways, beginning with a look at how an action potential (aka. "the spike") is produced. Then we consider what Humphries calls "the dark neurons," which are neurons that rarely generate spikes. We explore their role and also how it relates to the brain's spontaneous activity. One of the more surprising recent discoveries in neuroscience is that most of the brain's activity does not appear to be caused by external stimuli. It is not a passive receiver of information and this has profound implications for our understanding of things like how the brain generates conscious experience.</p> <p>This episode is for listeners of all backgrounds.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds</em></a> by Mark Humphries</li> <li><a href="https://www.humphries-lab.org" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Humphries Lab</a> at the University of Nottingham</li> <li>Please visit <a href= "http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additonal references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> Please Visit Our Sponsors: <ul> <li><a href= "https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=textexpander-July-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextExpander at textexpander.com/podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://NordVPN.com/brainscience" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">NordVPN at nordvpn.com/brainscience</a></li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>Support <em>Brain Science</em> by buying <a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/books"><em>Are You Sure?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Marsquakes reveal the Red Planet boasts a liquid core half its diameter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">reached Mars in late 2018</a> and soon afterward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-insight-lander-first-recording-marsquake">detected the first known marsquake</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/</em><em>18</em>; <em>SN: 4/23/19</em>). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abi7730">Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter</a>, he and colleagues report in the July 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>

<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in <em>Science</em>, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf2966">seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet</a>. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in <em>Science</em>, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8966">the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers</a>. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet&#8217;s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj8914">a commentary</a>, also published in <em>Science</em>, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Pterosaurs may have been able to fly as soon as they hatched</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92499-z">were strong and nimble fliers</a> from the start, researchers report July 22 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature known to take wing, and <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">aka “Monkeydactyl”</a>) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/429621a">flight membranes on the wings</a> of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny <em>Pteranodon</em> juvenile that was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2017.84">capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size</a>.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, <em>Pterodaustro guinazui</em> and <em>Sinopterus dongi</em>. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">not flying long distances</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">Fast scanning, triplet states and photon yield</a></h4>

              
                <p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their &#8220;dark&#8221; triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">see this Wikipedia article</a>). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing">exclusion principle</a> that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These <strong>long-lived triplet states</strong> could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming &#8220;dark&#8221; or non-functional from the experimenter&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16878313/">Borlinghaus, 2006</a>) as well as STEP microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3481">Schneider et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14766">Wu et al., 2015</a>) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (<a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.200700579">Petrášek and Schwille, 2008</a>), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that <strong>microsecond-long triplet states</strong> do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth986">Donnert et al., 2007</a>). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10193">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-4027">Gautam et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-12-5325">Castanares et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15618-w">Karpf et al., 2020</a>). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1175">Ji et al., 2008</a>), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by <a href="https://brainwindows.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/pulse-shaping-for-2-photon-signal-enhancement/">Andrew Hires</a> and on <a href="http://labrigger.com/blog/2011/12/31/optimizing-pulse-frequency-for-2p-imaging/">Labrigger</a>. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists &#8211; using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037565/">Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018</a>, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that <strong>faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield</strong>. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental approach</strong></p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+x_0+%5Ccdot+sin%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) = x_0 &#92;cdot sin( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x<sub>0</sub> = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28t%29+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+cos%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v(t) = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi &#92;cdot cos( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_%7Bmax%7D+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v_{max} = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 &#8211; 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 &#8211; 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let&#8217;s call this number the <strong>cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC)</strong> from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7Bremaining%7D+%3D+N_0+%5Ccdot+e%5E%7B-CPC%2F%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{remaining} = N_0 &#92;cdot e^{-CPC/&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, N<sub>remaining</sub>.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part I</strong></p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">Huang et al., 2020</a>). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of <strong>undesired variability</strong>.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is <strong>systematic averaging</strong>. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/12/01/matlab-code-for-instrument-control-of-a-resonant-scanning-microscope/">microscopy control software</a> myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe width='640' height='640' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/XpuydgMR?preloadContent=metadata&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1626817383'></script>
</div></figure>



<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>

<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you&#8217;re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>

<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part II</strong></p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That&#8217;s how these experiments looked like:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we&#8217;re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>

<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>

<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish&#8217;s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6879" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2-01b/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png" data-orig-size="953,849" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-2-01b" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=640" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=953" alt="" class="wp-image-6879" width="343" height="304" srcset="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=150 150w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>

<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample).<strong> I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. </strong>The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. <strong>Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. </strong>Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>

                <p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-infection-lung-cell-images">including viral invaders like the coronavirus</a> — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24521-x">clear tracts of cilia</a>, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-critically-ill-patient-double-lung-transplant">cause severe COVID-19</a>, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (<em>SN: 6/11/20</em>). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars has seen its future, and it’s full of rocks. Lots and lots of rocks. After spending the summer trundling through Jezero Crater and checking out the sights, it’s now time for Percy to get to work, teasing out the geologic history of its new home and seeking out signs of ancient microbial life.</p>



<p>“We’ve actually been on a road trip,” project manager Jennifer Trosper, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said at a July 21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66vjDLSt7kQ">news conference</a>. “And during it, we will take our very first sample from the surface of Mars.”</p>



<p>Percy is about 1 kilometer south of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">where it landed on February 18</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). After driving itself around a region of sand dunes, accompanied by its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">tagalong helicopter Ingenuity</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>), the robotic explorer has pulled up to its first sampling spot: a garden of flat, pale stones dubbed paver stones. “This is the area where we are really going to be digging in, both figuratively and literally, to understand the rocks that we have been on for the last several months,” said Kenneth Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech.</p>



<p>The team has been trying to figure out whether these rocks are volcanic or sedimentary. “We still don’t have the answer,” Farley said. Images taken a few centimeters above the surface show what the team is up against: The rocks are littered with dust and pebbles, probably blown in from elsewhere, and the smoother surfaces have a mysterious purplish coating. “All of these factors conspire to prevent us from peering into the rock and actually seeing what it is made out of,” he said.</p>





<p>In the coming weeks, Percy will bore a smooth cavity in one of those rocks and get below the surface crud. Instruments on its robotic arm will then move in close to produce detailed chemical and mineralogical maps that will reveal the rocks’ true nature. Then, sometime in mid-August, the team will extract its first sample. That sample will go into a tube that will eventually get dropped off — along with samples from other locales — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">for some future mission to pick up and bring to Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Cameras scouting farther afield have turned up future sampling sites. A small far-off hill shows hints of finely layered rock that may be mud deposits. “This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential biosignatures,” Farley said.</p>



<p>And the way that rocks are strewn about an ancient river delta in the distance suggests that the lake that once filled Jezero Crater went through multiple episodes of filling in and drying up. If true, Farley said, then the crater may have preserved “multiple time periods when we might be able to look for evidence of ancient life that might have existed on the planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-sponge-venus-flower-baskets-water-flow-fluid-dynamics">How intricate Venus’s-flower-baskets manipulate the flow of seawater</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Venus’s-flower-basket isn’t all show. This stunning deep-sea sponge can also alter the flow of seawater in surprising ways.</p>



<p>A lacy, barrel-shaped chamber forms the sponge’s glassy skeleton. Flow simulations reveal how this intricate structure <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03658-1">alters the way water moves around and through the sponge</a>, helping it endure unforgiving ocean currents and perhaps feed and reproduce, researchers report online July 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Previous studies have found that the gridlike construction of a Venus’s-flower-basket (<em>Euplectella aspergillum</em>) is strong and flexible. “But no one has ever tried to see if these beautiful structures have fluid-dynamic properties,” says mechanical engineer Giacomo Falcucci of Tor Vergata University of Rome.</p>



<p>Harnessing supercomputers, Falcucci and colleagues simulated how water flows around and through the sponge’s body, with and without different skeletal components such as the sponge’s myriad pores. If the sponge were a solid cylinder, water flowing past would form a turbulent wake immediately downstream that could jostle the creature, Falcucci says. Instead water flows through and around the highly porous Venus’s-flower-basket and forms a gentle zone of water that flanks the sponge and displaces turbulence downstream, the team found. That way, the sponge’s body endures less stress.</p>





<p>Ridges that spiral around the outside of the sponge’s skeleton also somehow cause water to slow and swirl inside the structure, the simulations showed. As a result, food and reproductive cells that drift into the sponge would become trapped for up to twice as long as in the same sponge without ridges. That lingering could help the filter feeders catch more plankton. And because Venus’s-flower-baskets can reproduce sexually, it could also enhance the chances that free-floating sperm encounter eggs, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s amazing that such beauty could be so functional, Falcucci says. The sponge’s flow-altering abilities, he says, might help inspire taller, more wind-resistant skyscrapers.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Having a &#8220;choice mindset&#8221; — believing, in short, that people’s behaviours are “choices”, or deliberate actions driven by their own motives and preferences — has multiple benefits. Those with a choice mindset feel as if they have control over their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-41019-032">own destiny</a>, for example, and see better outcomes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597817307197">negotiations</a>.</p>



<p>There are some drawbacks, however. Choice mindsets can lead to <a href="https://scholar.valpo.edu/fires/14/">victim blaming</a>, a lack of care about inequality, and a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611407928">reduced interest</a> in acts of social good. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211016140?journalCode=sppa">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> takes a closer look at these more troublesome impacts. Yidan Yin from UC San Diego and colleagues find that people in positions of power tend to adopt a choice mindset, which makes them more likely to blame others for mistakes.</p>



<span id="more-42957"></span>



<p>In the first study, 363 participants completed two surveys in a random order. One measured participants’ sense of power, asking how much they agreed with statements such as “I can get others to do what I want”. The other looked at their tendency to apportion blame. Participants were told that the researchers were crowdsourcing a solution to a real issue in their department: whether or not to give a bonus to an administrative assistant who had failed to meet a deadline for a grant, and claimed she had no choice because she was “caught up in other work”. They were then asked how much choice the assistant had in not completing the work, and whether or not they believed she was to blame for missing the deadline. Finally, they were asked to vote on whether or not she should receive the bonus.</p>



<p>The team found that participants with a higher sense of power believed the assistant had more choice, and were less likely to vote to give her a bonus. Similarly, those who perceived the assistant to have more choice blamed her more. This remained the case even when excluding participants who did not believe the scenario was real.</p>



<p>In the second study, the team looked at what happened when people were made to feel more or less powerful. Participants were told they had been placed into teams to rank in order of importance a list of tips about how to succeed on Mechanical Turk (the crowdsourcing website&nbsp; where the study took place). In the low power condition, participants were told they had been assigned the role of a &#8220;worker&#8221; who was inferior to other teammates, while in the high power condition they were a supervisor.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to summarise a transcription another team had supposedly made: the transcription was full of errors, which they were told was because the worker’s internet connection was unstable. They then answered questions about the transcription, indicating whether they believed the transcriber had a choice about correcting their errors, how much they were to blame, and whether they should receive payment for the transcription.</p>



<p>Again, participants in the high power group were both more likely to perceive the transcriber as having a choice than those in the low power group, which in turn made them more likely to blame and punish the transcriber by indicating they should not be paid. A third study also replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In all three studies, participants who felt more powerful were also more likely to see others as having more choice and, therefore, to blame them more when something went wrong — even if a reasonable explanation was given. As the team notes, this can’t just be because those in positions of power want to preserve their own position: in the first study, participants were asked to make a decision about someone completely unrelated to them and their own place in a social hierarchy. Instead, it may be that powerful people benefit psychologically from believing everyone’s position is related to choice, meaning they had reached their own position through merit and hard work.</p>



<p>Those in serious positions of power, such as policymakers and politicians, should therefore carefully consider how much choice people actually have in different situations. Are people “choosing” to remain on benefits, to use one issue highlighted by the team, or are they simply dealing with the constraints of their life and the world as best they can? If powerful people think more critically about when we really do have choice and when we don&#8217;t, it could avoid them unfairly blaming or punishing others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">A century of astronomy revealed Earth’s place in the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">A century ago, the Milky Way galaxy was the entirety of the known universe. We had no idea what made the stars shine, and only one star — our own sun — was known to harbor any planets. Of those planets, humans had explored only one: Earth.</p>



<p>“The stellar universe, as we know it … is a flattened, watch-shaped organization of stars and nebulae,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-8-1921">astronomer Harlow Shapley wrote in <em>Science News Bulletin</em></a>, the earliest version of <em>Science News</em>, in August 1921 (<em>SN: 8/8/1921, p. 3</em>). That sparkling pocket watch was the Milky Way, and at the time Shapley wrote this, astronomers were just beginning to conceive that anything at all might lie beyond it.</p>



<p>Today, spacecraft have flown by every one of the solar system’s planets, taking close-ups of their wildly alien faces. The solar system, it turns out, contains a cornucopia of small rocky and icy bodies that have challenged the very definition of a planet. Thousands of planets have been spotted orbiting other stars, some of which may have the right conditions for life to thrive. And the Milky Way, we now know, is just one of billions of galaxies.</p>

<p>The last 100 years have brought a series of revolutions in astronomy, each one kicking Earth a bit farther from the center of things. Along the way, people have not exactly been receptive to these blows to our home planet’s centrality. In 1920, the question of whether there could be other “island universes” — galaxies — was the subject of the Great Debate between two astronomers. In the 1970s, when Mars was shown to have a pink sky, not blue, reporters booed. Their reaction “reflects our wish for Mars to be just like the Earth,” said astronomer Carl Sagan afterward. And in the 1990s, astronomers almost missed extrasolar planets hiding in their data because they had tailored their search techniques to find planets more like those in our own solar system.</p>



<p>But turning our focus from Earth has opened our minds to new possibilities, new universes, new places where life might exist. The next century of astronomy could bring better views of our cosmic origins and new strategies for finding worlds that other creatures call home.</p>



<p>The misperceptions of decades past suggest scientists should be careful when predicting just what we’ll find in the future.</p>



<p>“You learn a lot of humility in this business,” says planetary scientist Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson. “You always learn a lot more when you’re wrong than when you’re right.”</p>





<h4>More than the Milky Way</h4>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, conventional wisdom held that the Milky Way stood alone. It contained stars, sometimes organized in clusters, and fuzzy patches of light known as nebulae. That was about it.</p>



<p>Some nebulae had spiral structures, “appearing in the telescope like vast Fourth-of-July pinwheels,” as <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">described them in 1924</a>. In the 18th century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant had described nebulae as “higher universes,” or, “so to speak, Milky Ways.” But by the early 1900s, most astronomers thought that drawing that parallel was ridiculous.</p>



<p>“No competent thinker,” wrote historian of astronomy Agnes Clerke in 1890, can “maintain any single nebula to be a star system of coordinate rank with the Milky Way.”</p>



<p>By the 1920s, though, that view was already being challenged. As early as 1914, astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory in California argued that spiral nebulae are not part of the Milky Way, but rather “inconceivably distant galaxies of stars or separate stellar universes so remote that an entire galaxy becomes but an unresolved haze of light.”</p>



<p>Around the same time, Shapley, of Mount Wilson Observatory in California, began to prove that the Milky Way itself was inconceivably vast.</p>



<p>Shapley built on work by Henrietta Leavitt, one of a group of women “computers” at Harvard University who pored over photographic plates capturing the night sky. In studying photographs of the Magellanic Clouds, which we now know are two small galaxies that orbit the Milky Way, Leavitt noticed that certain stars varied in brightness over time, some of them in a peculiar way. “It is worthy of notice,” she wrote in 1908, that “the brighter variables have the longer periods.” In other words, brighter stars twinkled more slowly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="595" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt.jpg" alt="black and white image of Henrietta Leavitt sitting at a desk" class="wp-image-3101680" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt-663x383.jpg 663w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt-779x450.jpg 779w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt-322x186.jpg 322w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt-768x444.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt-1004x580.jpg 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101680">In the early 1900s, astronomer Henrietta Leavitt discovered a feature of certain stars, called Cepheid variables, that helped other astronomers measure cosmic distances. Those stars ultimately helped prove that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101680">Photo by Margaret Harwood, courtesy of AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives, Physics Today Collection, Shapley Collection</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That meant that these variable stars, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/blinking-stars-show-size-universe">Cepheids, could be used to estimate cosmic distances</a>. It’s hard to tell how far away a cosmic object truly is — bright-looking stars could be intrinsically dim but close, while faint-looking stars could be intrinsically bright but distant. But all the Cepheids within the same cloud should be roughly the same distance from Earth. That meant “their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light,” Leavitt wrote in 1912. To figure out any Cepheid’s true brightness, all an astronomer had to do was measure its twinkling speed. It was a short step from there to figuring out its distance.</p>



<p>Shapley put this fact to use just a few years later, measuring distances to Cepheids within globular clusters of stars to figure out the sun’s position in the Milky Way. To his surprise, the sun was not in the center of the galaxy but off to one side. The Milky Way’s starry disk was also about 10 times wider than previous astronomers had assumed: about 300,000 light-years across, according to his calculations. (He overshot a bit; modern astronomers think it’s somewhere between 120,000 and 200,000 light-years.)</p>



<p>He and Curtis took their opposing views to the public at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., in April 1920, in an event that became known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-great-debate-island-universe-milky-way">the Great Debate</a>. Each had 40 minutes to present their views on whether there is only one or several universes — what we now think of as galaxies.</p>



<p>Shapley, who was in his 30s and considered a rising star in the field, went first. A former journalist who reportedly was uncomfortable speaking to crowds, he read his argument from a typewritten script. He barely touched on the question of other universes, focusing instead on his new measurements of the Milky Way’s size. The implication was that the Milky Way was too large for other galaxies to make sense.</p>



<p>Curtis was an older, well-respected authority on spiral nebulae, as well as a gifted speaker. He argued for the then-standard view that the Milky Way was much smaller than Shapley supposed. But even a large Milky Way shouldn’t negate the possibility of other, equally large galaxies, he argued. The spectra of light coming from spiral nebulae was similar enough to that of the Milky Way that they could be similar objects, he maintained.</p>



<p>Both astronomers were partly right, and partly wrong.</p>



<h4>Galaxies come into view</h4>



<p>The Great Debate was resolved by a young astronomer named Edwin Hubble working at Mount Wilson. Hubble also used Leavitt’s Cepheid variable technique to measure cosmic distances, this time by finding the variable stars in the spiral nebulae themselves.</p>



<p>Hubble started observing the Andromeda nebula, one of the brightest nebulae on the sky, in the fall of 1923. He used Mount Wilson’s 60-inch telescope and its 100-inch telescope, then the world’s largest. Over the next year or so, he studied 35 Cepheids in Andromeda and a different nebula called Triangulum. Their periods were long enough that the nebulae had to be on the order of a million light-years away for the stars to appear so faint. (We now know it’s more like 2.5 million light-years to Andromeda and 2.7 million to Triangulum.)</p>

<p>“Measuring the distance to Andromeda was a big deal because it was the first evidence that there are galaxies beyond our own,” says astronomer Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle. “It changed what we thought of as the shape of our universe.”</p>



<p>A few hints that the Milky Way was not alone had cropped up before that, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/universe-expands-when-astronomer-discovers-other-stellar-systems">Hubble’s finding clinched it</a>. Even if the Milky Way was as big as Shapley claimed, Andromeda lay outside its borders. When Shapley received Hubble’s paper, he reportedly said, “Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.”</p>



<p><em>Science News Letter</em> reported Hubble’s finding under the headline “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">Sky Pinwheels Are Stellar Universes 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Miles Away</a>” in December 1924 (<em>SN: 12/6/24, p. 2</em>).</p>



<p>“It seems probable that many of the smaller spiral nebulae are still more remote and appear smaller on this account,” the story quotes Hubble as saying. “The portion of the universe within the range of our investigation consists of vast numbers of stellar galaxies comparable to our own, scattered about through nearly empty space and separated from one another by distances of inconceivable magnitude.” Here at last was the modern view of the universe.</p>



<p>By the end of the decade, Hubble had not only shown that the spiral nebulae were “island universes,” he also had begun to classify different galaxy types and think about how they evolved over time. What’s more, he showed that galaxies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nebulae-hold-skys-speed-record">were flying away from each other</a> at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientist-says-universe-actually-exploding">the universe was expanding</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, astronomers knew that the universe was dotted with billions of galaxies of all shapes and sizes. In April 1990, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/antenna-jam-delays-hubbles-first-light">NASA launched</a> the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/space-telescope-saga-setbacks">first optical space telescope</a> into Earth’s orbit, giving the world a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubble-finally-has-stars-its-eyes">new perspective on space</a>.</p>



<p>“Instead of these blurry blobs from even the best mountaintop observatories on our planet,” says planetary scientist Jim Bell of Arizona State University in Tempe, “all of a sudden the entire realm of solar system, galaxy, extragalactic … was opened up by getting above the atmosphere.”</p>



<p>NASA named the telescope after the scientist who opened astronomers’ minds to the existence of such a universe: the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-celebrating-hubbles-past-focus-its-future">images it has captured over 30 years</a> of operations — star clusters, galaxies and nebulae — are so iconic they are printed on everything from socks and coffee mugs to high fashion runway designs. The telescope itself was recently immortalized in Lego form.</p>



<p>“It’s the one that literally everyone has heard of,” says Levesque. Most people today think Hubble was “the guy who built the telescope.”</p>



<p>One image from early on in the space telescope’s tenure stands out. In December 1995, the telescope’s director, Robert Williams, decided to train the observatory on a tiny, dark patch of sky near the handle of the Big Dipper for 10 consecutive days. The resulting portrait of this featureless bit of sky revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubbles-deep-view-universe">thousands of previously unknown galaxies</a> sending their light from farther away than astronomers had ever seen before (<em>SN: 1/20/96, p. 36</em>). The universe as Edwin Hubble had imagined it, chock-full of island universes, was captured in one hard look.</p>



<p>As for Henrietta Leavitt, she missed out on the recognition she deserved for helping knock the Milky Way from its central perch. A Swedish mathematician wrote to her in 1925 saying that her work “has impressed me so deeply that I feel seriously inclined to nominate you to the Nobel Prize in physics for 1926.” He received a reply from Shapley, by then director of the Harvard College Observatory: Leavitt had died four years earlier.</p>

<h3>Bizarre beauties</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, astronomer Halton Arp proposed that researchers use the weirdest-looking galaxies as natural experiments to learn what gives a galaxy its shape. To help researchers figure out what makes a galaxy spiral, blobby or some other shape, Arp published the 1966 <em>Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies</em>, a compilation of 338 galaxies sorted by appearance.</p>



<p>Arp’s categories were spiral, elliptical, neither spiral nor elliptical, double and none of the above. At the time, some of the galaxies had no names or designations, and are still best known by their Arp numbers, like Arp 273 and Arp 147.</p>



<p>Despite their diversity, most of the peculiar galaxies are now thought to be going through a merger or interacting with another galaxy. But Arp never bought that explanation. He claimed for years that galaxies’ shapes come from material ejected from their luminous cores. Here are six of the most beautiful and bizarre galaxies, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, which offer much greater detail than Arp had access to half a century ago. — <em>Lisa Grossman</em></p>

<h4>Steps to Mars</h4>



<p>The first liquid-fueled rockets, precursors to the ones that later carried robots and people into space, launched in the 1920s. A century later, robots have flown past, orbited or landed on every planetary body that was known in 1920, and a few that weren’t. People have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">walked on the moon</a> and have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-twins-study-reveals-effects-space-scott-kelly-health">lived in space</a> for more than a year at a time. And serious talks about sending people to Mars are in the works.</p>



<p>NASA used to explore other worlds in a clear order, first observing with telescopes and then carrying out increasingly complex missions: flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers, then people and sample returns. “We’ve taken that entire progression on the moon, in [the last] century,” Bell says. “Sometime in this new century, we’ll add Mars to that list. All the rest of the solar system, we’ve got large chunks of that matrix checked off.”</p>



<p>After the Soviet Union <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/compare-moon-programs">launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957</a>, space launches came fast and furious. Many were demonstrations of political and military might. But a lot of them had scientific merit, too. The Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/1959-science-review">photographed the farside of the moon</a> in 1959 — shortly after NASA’s founding. Spacecraft flew past <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/still-mystery">Venus</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-closer-look-nearby-world">Mars</a> in the 1960s, sending back the first closeup data on their alien atmospheres and surfaces.</p>



<p>That same decade, humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">landed on the moon</a> and<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ancient-moon-samples-exhilarate-selenologists"> brought back rocks</a>, opening a wide and detailed window into the history of the solar system. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">lunar samples from the Apollo missions</a> gave scientists a way to figure out how old planetary surfaces are around the solar system, taught us that the entire inner solar system was bombarded with impacts in its youth and gave us an origin story for the moon (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>“Until we started the space program, we really had no idea what the geology was on other places,” says Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute. “Early in the century, they were still debating whether the craters on the moon were impact craters or volcanic calderas. Even right there in our own backyard, we didn’t know what was going on.”</p>



<p>And extraterrestrial geology was surprising. Without meaning to, planetary scientists had based a lot of their expectations for other worlds on the Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/june-5-1976">cover of <em>Science News</em> from June 1976</a>, the month before NASA’s Viking 1 lander became the first long-lived spacecraft to land softly on Mars, showed Mars with a Cheez Whiz–colored desert under a clear blue sky. In the sleep-deprived rush to release the first color images sent back by Viking 1, scientists processed the image to produce a blue sky there, too.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="912" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover.jpg" alt="cover of Science News magazine with an illustration of Viking 1 on Mars" class="wp-image-3101681" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover-286x383.jpg 286w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover-336x450.jpg 336w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover-139x186.jpg 139w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover-432x580.jpg 432w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover-579x776.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption>Before NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft landed on Mars in July 1976,&nbsp;<em>Science News</em>&nbsp;and others envisioned the Red Planet with a blue sky. Mars’ sky is actually a dusty yellowish-pink.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But the day after the landing, James Pollack of the imaging team told reporters that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/week-mars">Martian sky was actually pink</a>, probably thanks to scattered light from dust particles suspended in the air.</p>



<p>“When we found the sky of Mars to be a kind of pinkish-yellow rather than the blue which had erroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a chorus of good-natured boos from the assembled reporters,” Sagan later wrote in the introduction to his popular book <em>Cosmos</em>. “They wanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth.”</p>



<p>Still, the Viking 1 and 2 landings brought Mars down to Earth, so to speak. “Mars had become a place,” Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen said in an interview for a NASA historical project published in 1984. “It went from a word, an abstract thought, to a real place.”</p>



<p>In some ways, the Viking landers’ views of Mars were disappointing. The mission’s central goal was explicitly to search for microbial life. It was “a long shot,” journalist Janet L. Hopson wrote <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/martian-life-odds-and-oddities">in <em>Science News</em> in June 1976</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/76, p. 374</em>). But “even if no signs of life appear, [biologists] stand to gain their first real perspective on terrestrial biochemistry, life origins and evolution.”</p>



<p>The results of the Viking mission’s life-detection experiments were inconclusive, a finding almost worse than a true negative.</p>



<p>NASA subsequently pulled back from seeking life directly. The next 45 years of Mars missions searched for signs of past water, potentially habitable environments and organic molecules, instead of living organisms. All of those features turned up in data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-spirit-still-running-only-place">Spirit</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-dead">Opportunity</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-weighed-mountain-its-climbing">Curiosity</a> rovers in the 2000s and 2010s.</p>



<p>Now, NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover</a>, which landed in February 2021, is hunting for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">signs of ancient microbial life</a>. The rover will cache rock samples that a future mission will bring back to Earth. And the joint Russian and European space agencies’ ExoMars rover — named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist whose work was central to discovering DNA’s structure — aims to seek molecular signatures of life on Mars and just below the surface after it launches in 2022.</p>



<p>Sagan predicted in 1973 that if he had been born 50 years in the future, the search for life on Mars would have already been completed. Today, 48 years later, we’re still looking.</p>

<h4>Exotic moons</h4>



<p>The year after the Vikings landed on Mars, another pair of spacecraft launched to check almost the entire rest of the solar system off scientists’ must-see list. Astronomers realized that in 1977, the planets would line up in such a way that a spacecraft launched that year could reach Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune one by one, stealing a little angular momentum from each world as it went along. The mission was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/voyager-hard-start-long-road">dubbed Voyager</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/77, p. 132</em>).</p>



<p>“There’s never been anything like it, and there never will be again,” says Bell, of Arizona State. “It was comparable to the voyages of Magellan or Darwin or Lewis and Clark. Just an absolutely profound mission of discovery that completely changed the landscape of planetary science in this century.”</p>



<p>Voyager’s views of the outer solar system forced scientists to think outside of the “Earth box,” says Hansen, who worked on the mission. “The Voyager imaging team, bless their hearts, they would make predictions and then they’d be wrong,” she says. “And we would learn something.”</p>



<p>Hansen recalls chatting with a member of the imaging team when the spacecraft was approaching Jupiter and its dozens of moons. “He said, ‘Candy, we will see craters on [moons] Io and Europa, because we know from the density that those are rocky worlds. But not on Ganymede and Callisto, because those are ice,’ ” she recalls. Instead, the images showed Ganymede and Callisto were covered in craters. “That was an aha moment — ice is going to act like rock at those temperatures.” Meanwhile, ocean-swathed Europa and molten Io had almost no craters.</p>



<p>The moons of Jupiter presented “a whole, previously unimagined family of exotic worlds, each radically different not only from its companions, but also from everything else in the planet-watcher’s experience,” journalist Jonathan Eberhart wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire"><em>Science News</em> in April 1980</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/80, p. 251</em>).</p>



<p>Before 1979, Earth was the only geologically active, rocky world scientists knew about. But Voyager changed that view, too. A member of Voyager’s optical navigation team, Linda Morabito, spotted an odd, mushroom-shaped feature extending off the edge of Io while she was trying to plot the spacecraft’s position on March 9, 1979. She consulted with the science team, and they soon realized they were looking at a gigantic volcanic plume. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire">Io was erupting</a> in real time.</p>



<p>Three planetary scientists had predicted Io’s fire before the plumes were discovered. The three suggested the moon was heated by a gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter and one or two of its other moons, Europa and Ganymede.</p>



<p>But most of the planetary science community was stunned. “We take gravity for granted here. It keeps our feet on the ground,” Hansen says. “But gravity molds and shapes so many things in so many unexpected ways.”</p>



<p>Voyager and subsequent missions to the outer planets, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/close-encounter-galileo-eyes-io">Galileo at Jupiter</a> in the 1990s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturns-rings-panoramic-perspective">Cassini at Saturn</a> in the 2000s, transformed our view of the solar system in another profound way. They revealed several surprising parts of the solar system where life might exist today.</p>



<p>Voyager hinted that Europa might have a liquid water ocean beneath an icy shell. Galileo strengthened that idea, and suggested the ocean might be salty and have contact with the moon’s rocky core, which could provide chemical nutrients for microbial life. NASA is now developing a mission to fly past Europa. “I will not be surprised if life is somehow discovered on Europa in my lifetime, or in this century,” Bell says.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, scientists realized that the tiny moon Enceladus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">vents dramatic plumes</a> of water vapor, dust and ice crystals into space from a hidden subsurface sea. That moon also looks like a good place for life.</p>



<p>If the last century of exploring the solar system was about coming to grips with alien geology, Hansen says, this coming century is going to be about oceanography — getting a grip on the strange seas in our own solar system.</p>



<p>“I think that’s going to shape a lot of the research going forward,” Hansen says. Now that it’s clear these moons have oceans, researchers will ask if they are habitable, and eventually, if they are inhabited.</p>



<h4>Exoplanets detected</h4>



<p>The first planet spotted outside our solar system — an exoplanet — was so different from anything in our solar system that astronomers weren’t hunting for anything like it.</p>



<p>“Knowing that there are actually planets around other stars now seems so trivial to say,” says exoplanet observer Debra Fischer of Yale University. “But we had arguments in 1995 about whether other stars have planets.”</p>



<p>So when astronomer Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory turned his spectrograph on the sky in April 1994, he kept quiet about his hopes of finding true exoplanets. He was more likely to find brown dwarfs, failed stars that never grew massive enough to burn hydrogen.</p>



<p>His instrument used a clever new way to hunt for other worlds, called the radial velocity technique. Previous exoplanet hunters had looked directly for a star’s motion in response to the gravity of an orbiting planet, watching to see if the star would move back and forth in the sky. That technique had led to several planetary claims, even dating back to 1855, but none of them had held up. Those motions are tiny; Jupiter’s influence moves the sun by just 12 meters per second.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Exoplanet detections</h3>



<p>Astronomers have hunted exoplanets with several techniques, some better than others. The earliest claimed exoplanet detections used the astrometry method, but almost none of them held up. Success came with the radial velocity method in the 1990s. But the transit method has proved most prolific. </p>

</div>



<p>Instead, Mayor and others studied a shift in the wavelength of starlight as a star moved to and fro. As a star approaches us, the light shifts to shorter, or bluer, wavelengths; as it moves away, the light grows redder. Calculating the velocity of a star’s back-and-forth motion, astronomers could figure out the minimum mass and length of the year of whatever was tugging that star.</p>



<p>The shifts Mayor was looking for were still minuscule. The search was considered futile, and fringe — like looking for little green men. So astronomers who explicitly claimed to be searching for planets had a hard time scheduling observations at telescopes. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, were considered legitimate science, and would be easier to detect.</p>



<p>So the world was astounded when, in October 1995, Mayor and his student Didier Queloz reported strong evidence not of a brown dwarf, but of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">a true planet orbiting the sunlike star 51 Pegasi</a>, about 50 light-years from our solar system.</p>



<p>The new planet was weird. It seemed to be about half the mass of Jupiter, too puny to be a brown dwarf. But it orbited the star once every 4.23 Earth days, putting it incredibly close to its star. There’s nothing like that in our solar system, and astronomers had no idea how it could exist.</p>



<p>“The news flashed through the astronomical community like a lightning bolt,” wrote journalist Ron Cowen in <em>Science News</em>, in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">first</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/searching-other-worlds">three</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-emerge-dark">stories</a> on the new planet he would write within a month (<em>SN: 10/21/95, p. 260</em>).</p>



<p>51 Peg b, as it came to be known, launched a new era. “It means planets exist around other sunlike stars, we can find them, and they might be the exciting ones,” says Yale anthropologist Lisa Messeri, who has studied how astronomers create worlds out of pixels and spectra. “Firsts are exciting because they promise there will be seconds and thirds and fourths.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Big surprise&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The first planet found orbiting a star similar to our sun fit nobody’s mold. Dubbed a “hot Jupiter,” 51 Pegasi b is bigger than Jupiter, but 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun (Earth is one astronomical unit, AU, or 150 million kilometers from the sun). 51 Pegasi b circles its star in four days; Earth’s orbit is a lengthier 365 days.</p>

</div>



<p>The search was on. A group from San Francisco quickly found two more planets hiding in data the researchers hadn’t finished analyzing yet. Those next two planets, 70 Vir b and 47 UMa b, were also more massive and closer to their stars than expected.</p>



<p>The existence of these three worlds, which were named hot Jupiters because their close-in orbits should make them sizzle, upended the paradigm for what a planet could be like. Clearly, our solar system was not the template for the universe.</p>



<p>Yet for a few years after 51 Peg b was announced, astronomers debated whether the planet was really there. Maybe the star’s apparent back-and-forth was just its outer atmosphere breathing in and out. Those debates waned as more planets were discovered, but it took a new technique to really convince everyone.</p>



<p>Astronomers had predicted at least back to the 1850s that some planets would pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. As it crossed, or transited, the face of its star, a planet could reveal its presence by blocking a little bit of the star’s light.</p>



<p>But if other solar systems are like ours, transits would be incredibly difficult to detect. Our planets are too small and too far from the sun to cast a large shadow. Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, should block way more of a star’s light than any planets in our solar system. With the discovery of 51 Peg b, transits seemed not only possible to detect, but almost easy.</p>



<p>The first transiting extrasolar planet revealed itself in 1999, when then-Harvard graduate student David Charbonneau drove to Colorado to do his thesis work with astronomer Tim Brown. Brown had built a tiny telescope on a friend’s farm north of Boulder, setting up the computers in a repurposed turkey coop, to search for transiting planets. By the time Charbonneau arrived, however, the farm had been sold and the telescope relocated to a lab site.</p>



<p>To practice the technique, Charbonneau aimed Brown’s telescope at a star, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-out-shadows">called HD 209458</a>, that already had a suspected planet. The star’s light dimmed by about 1 percent, and then it shone bright again. That was a clear sign of a planet about 32 percent wider than Jupiter.</p>



<p>That discovery ended all doubts about the existence of exoplanets, says Fischer, who had worked with the exoplanet-hunting group in San Francisco. “It happened like that,” Fischer says, with a finger snap. The combined size and mass of the planet unambiguously ruled out brown dwarfs or other exotic explanations. “It walks like a Jupiter, talks like a Jupiter, it’s a Jupiter.”</p>



<p>There was another advantage to the transit method: It can show the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/craft-probes-alien-planets-atmosphere">composition of a planet’s atmosphere</a>. Planets detected by the wobble technique were “little more than phantoms,” Cowen wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/passages"><em>Science News</em> in 2007</a>. They were too small to be seen, and too close to the star to be photographed directly.</p>



<p>“Everyone had assumed that if you wanted to [detect] the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, you’d have to image it,” Charbonneau told <em>Science News</em>. But starlight filtering through a transiting planet’s sky could reveal what gases surround the alien world without the need for a snapshot.</p>



<h4>Hunt for habitable planets</h4>



<p>Transits soon overtook wobbles as the most fruitful planet-finding strategy. That was mostly thanks to the launch of NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-space-telescope-finds-its-first-extrasolar-planets">Kepler space telescope</a> in March 2009.</p>



<p>Kepler’s mission was explicitly about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-superearths">finding other Earths</a>. For nearly four years, the telescope stared at 170,000 stars in a single patch of sky to catch as many transiting planets as it could. In particular, its operators were hoping for Earth-sized planets in Earthlike orbits around sunlike stars — places where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunt-habitable-planets">life could conceivably exist</a>.</p>



<p>The years that followed were a boom time for planet finders. By the end of its nearly 10-year run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler had confirmed almost 2,700 planets</a> and thousands more potential planets. Findings went beyond the hot Jupiters to worlds the size of Earth and planets in the “habitable zone,” where temperatures could be right for liquid water.</p>



<p>Discoveries came so quickly that a single new world stopped being a news story. Kepler’s data shifted from revealing new worlds one by one to taking an exoplanet census. It showed that hot Jupiters are not actually the most common type of planet; they were just the easiest ones to spot. The most common type makes no appearance in our solar system: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-exoplanets-habitable-earth-neptune">worlds between the size of Earth and Neptune</a>, which may be rocky super-Earths or gaseous mini-Neptunes.</p>



<p>And Kepler revealed that there are more planets in the galaxy than stars. Every one of the billions and billions of stars in the Milky Way should have at least one world in its orbit.</p>



<p>But the telescope never really achieved the goal of finding another Earth. Kepler required three transits to confirm a world’s existence. That means the telescope had to stare for at least three years to find a planet orbiting at Earth’s exact distance.</p>



<p>By 2013, after four years of observing, half of Kepler’s stabilizing reaction wheels had failed. The telescope couldn’t maintain its unblinking view of the same part of the sky. Mission scientists cleverly reprogrammed the telescope to look at other stars for shorter spans of time. But most of the planets found there orbited closer to their stars than Earth does, meaning they couldn’t be Earth twins.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler ran out of fuel in 2018</a>, with no true Earth analog in sight.</p>



<p>Messeri recalls an exoplanet conference at MIT in 2011 where a lot of the conversation was about finding a twin of Earth.</p>



<p>“It was a peak of excitement — maybe we’re going to find this planet in the next three years, or five years. It felt close,” she says. “What’s interesting is, in the 10 years since then, it still feels that close.”</p>



<p>But astronomers had already realized they might not need a true Earth analog to find a planet where life could exist. Rocky worlds orbiting smaller, dimmer stars than the sun are easier to find, and might be just as friendly to life.</p>



<p>Charbonneau again was ahead of the curve, having started a program called MEarth in 2008 to hunt for habitable planets around puny M dwarf stars using eight small telescopes in Arizona (plus another eight in Chile that were added in 2014). Within six months, Charbonneau and colleagues had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-exotic-water-world">found a super-Earth dubbed GJ 1214b</a> that is probably a water world — maybe a bit too wet for life.</p>



<p>The European Southern Observatory started the TRAPPIST, for TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope, survey from La Silla, Chile, in 2010. Another telescope, at Oukaïmeden Observatory in Morocco, came online to search for planets orbiting Northern Hemisphere stars in 2016. Among that survey’s discoveries is the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star">TRAPPIST-1 system</a> of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single M dwarf star, three of which might be in the habitable zone (<em>SN: 3/18/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="515" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist.jpg" alt="illustration of the TRAPPIST-1 planet system" class="wp-image-3101682" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist-680x340.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist-800x400.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist-330x165.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101682">The star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven planets (shown in an artist’s illustration) that all probably have a rocky composition.

<p>NASA’s successor to Kepler, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/launch-tess-nasa-boost-search-exoplanets">TESS</a>, or Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, has been scanning the entire sky since April 2018 for small planets orbiting bright nearby stars, including M dwarfs. It spotted more than 2,200 potential planets in its<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tess-space-telescope-has-spotted-its-first-exoplanet"> first full-sky scan</a>, scientists announced in March 2021.</p>



<p>These days, astronomers are joining up with scientists across disciplines, from planetary scientists who study hypothetical exoplanet geology to microbiologists and chemists who think about what kinds of aliens could live on those planets and how to detect those life-forms. That’s a big shift from even 10 years ago, Messeri says. In the early 2010s, no one was talking about life.</p>



<p>“You weren’t allowed to say that,” she says. “Astronomers would whisper it to me during fieldwork, but this was not a search for aliens.”</p>



<p>Exoplanet astronomy is on firmer ground now. Its leading figures have won MacArthur “genius” grants. Pioneer planet finders Mayor and Queloz <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-2019-early-universe-cosmic-microwave-exoplanets">won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics</a>. The work is no longer hidden away in conferences that are actually about stars. “It doesn’t have to legitimize itself anymore,” Messeri says. “It’s a real science.”</p>



<p>The promise that transiting planets can reveal the contents of their alien atmospheres may soon be fulfilled. NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> may launch this year, after many years of delays. One of its first tasks will be to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets, including those of TRAPPIST-1.</p>



<p>If anything is alive on those absolutely alien, unearthly worlds, maybe the next century will bring it to light.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xerxes-blue-butterfly-first-human-caused-us-insect-extinction">This butterfly is the first U.S. insect known to go extinct because of people</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been roughly 80 years since the Xerces blue butterfly was last spotted flitting about on pastel wings across coastal California sand dunes. But scientists are still learning about the insect.</p>



<p>New research on DNA from a nearly century-old museum specimen shows that the butterfly was a distinct species. That finding means that the Xerces blue butterfly (<em>Glaucopsyche xerces</em>) is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0123">the first U.S. insect species that scientists recognized went extinct because of humans</a>, researchers report July 21 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. There are insects that went extinct earlier, like the Rocky Mountain locust (<em>Melanoplus spretus</em>), that scientists have strong suspicions that humans were to blame for the extinction. But for this butterfly, there was no question at the time.</p>



<p>The butterfly used to live only on the San Francisco Peninsula. But by the early 1940s, less than a century after its formal scientific description in the 1850s, the gossamer-winged butterfly had vanished. Its rapid disappearance is attributed to the loss of habitat and native plant food as a result of urban development and, possibly, an influx of invasive ants likely spread though the shipment of goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s long been unclear if the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species, or simply an isolated population of another, more widespread species of blue butterfly, says Corrie Moreau, an entomologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>To find out, Moreau and colleagues turned to a 93-year-old Xerces specimen housed at Chicago’s Field Museum, extracting DNA from a tiny bit of the insect’s tissue. Despite the DNA being degraded from age, the team could compare selected Xerces genes with those of other closely related blue butterflies. The researchers also compared the genomes, or genetic instruction books, of the insects’ mitochondria — cellular structures involved in energy production that have their own set of DNA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the genes and the “mitogenomes,” the researchers crafted an evolutionary tree, showing how all of the butterfly species are related to each other. The extinct Xerces blue butterfly was genetically distinct, thus warranting classification as a species, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We sort of lost a piece of the biodiversity puzzle that made up the tapestry of the San Francisco Bay area when this species was driven to extinction,” Moreau says.</p>





<p>Akito Kawahara, a lepidopterist at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville not involved with the study, thinks the results are “fairly convincing” that the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species.</p>



<p>The butterfly is considered a candidate for resurrection, Moreau says, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/resurrecting-extinct-species-raises-ethical-questions">extinct species are brought back via cloning</a> or other genetic manipulations (<em>SN: 10/20/17</em>). But she cautions against it. “Maybe we should spend that time and energy and money on ensuring that we protect the blues that are already endangered that we know about,” she says.</p>





<p>One of these insects is the endangered El Segundo blue (<em>Euphilotes battoides allyni</em>), native to the Los Angeles area. It and other butterfly populations are increasingly imperiled by numerous threats, such as climate change, land-use changes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-piles-popular-pesticides-link-pollinator-problems">pesticide use</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/17/16</em>).</p>



<p>For Felix Grewe, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum, the new finding illustrates why long-term museum collections are so important: Specimens’ true utility may not be clear for many years. After all, the genetic techniques used in the study to illuminate the Xerces blue butterfly’s true identity didn’t exist when the insect went extinct.</p>



<p>“You don&#8217;t know what technology there [will be] 100 years from now,” Grewe says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite the fact that psychology students are more likely to be women than men, and that women outnumber men in the clinical psychology workforce, women in psychology <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620952789">publish less</a>, receive fewer citations, and are underrepresented at senior positions within university departments. This juxtaposition of over and underrepresentation poses an interesting question about how people perceive gender roles within the field.</p>



<p>It’s this question Guy A. Boysen and team explore <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1921682?src=">in a new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Social Psychology</em>. They find that people associate psychology more strongly with femininity than masculinity — and that this may affect how men and women feel about working or studying within the field.</p>



<span id="more-42933"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants filling in surveys online were asked what percentage of students studying psychology at university level were women, and what percentage of psychologists were women. The results showed that people see psychology as a more women-heavy profession and discipline, with participants estimating that 62% of psychology students and 59% of psychologists are women.</p>



<p>A second study looked more directly at people’s perceptions of how “feminine” or “masculine” psychology is as a field. Both online participants and undergraduate students rated various university degrees and careers on a scale from “extremely feminine” to “extremely masculine”. The breadth of majors and careers listed were included due to their association with particular gendered stereotypes — engineering, for example, is stereotypically assumed to be a masculine job while nursing is thought to be feminine.</p>



<p>A psychology major was considered by both groups to be slightly more feminine than masculine, and was rated as significantly more feminine than typically &#8220;masculine&#8221; subjects like engineering, business, and maths (though majors like nursing and education were considered more feminine than psychology). Similarly, while a career in psychology was seen as less feminine than teaching or nursing, it was considered significantly more feminine than being a neuroscientist, historian, doctor, or business person.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants were asked to imagine a stereotypical person in one of three subjects at university: engineering, nursing, or psychology. After being shown stereotypically masculine and feminine traits — for example &#8220;gentle&#8221; for feminine or &#8220;egotistical&#8221; for masculine — participants rated how well each word described a person studying the subject they had been assigned.</p>



<p>As expected, participants tended to believe that both positive and negative masculine traits better described engineering students than psychology students, while positive feminine traits better described psychology students than engineers. The only difference between nursing and psychology was in positive masculine traits: these were believed to better suit nursing majors than psychology students. This suggests that psychology, like nursing, is largely considered to be a “feminine” subject.</p>



<p>In a fourth study, participants indicated how satisfied they believed men and women would be with a career in psychology. Participants who read that psychology students were 75% women and 25% men rated men’s satisfaction as significantly lower than women’s. But those who read there was an equal percentage of women and men didn’t show any difference in ratings of men’s and women’s satisfaction. A similar follow-up part of the study also found that men were seen as less likely to have their needs met by a career in psychology than women.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggested that psychology is considered to be significantly more feminine than it is masculine, and that people assume men’s needs may therefore not be met by it as a subject of study or a career. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But is this actually true? Future research could look at how men and women in psychology feel themselves — just because a field is perceived to be &#8220;feminine&#8221; doesn’t mean that men will necessarily be less satisfied or fulfilled when working within it. Whether men are actually put off careers in psychology is a different question that could be explored in more depth.</p>



<p>It’s also important to go back to the fact of the overrepresentation of men in certain positions. If psychology is seen as a &#8220;feminine&#8221; occupation, and if women outnumber men, why do men <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/gender-composition/task-force-report.pdf">dominate positions of power</a>? Looking at ways for everyone to succeed and feel comfortable in psychology is crucial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-microbes-habitability-aliens-extraterrestrial">Missing Antarctic microbes raise thorny questions about the search for aliens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even in the harshest environments, microbes always seem to get by. They thrive everywhere from boiling-hot seafloor hydrothermal vents to high on Mt. Everest. Clumps of microbial cells have even been found clinging to the hull of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bacteria-band-together-survival-years-astrobiology">International Space Station</a> (<em>SN: 08/26/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was no reason for microbial ecologist Noah Fierer to expect that the 204 soil samples he and colleagues had collected near Antarctica’s Shackleton Glacier would be any different. A spoonful of typical soil could easily contain billions of microbes, and Antarctic soils from other regions host at least a few thousand per gram. So he assumed that all of his samples would host at least some life, even though the air around Shackleton Glacier is so cold and so arid that Fierer often left his damp laundry outside to freeze-dry.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, some of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JG006052">coldest, driest soils didn’t seem to be inhabited by microbes</a> at all, he and colleagues report in the June <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</em>. To Fierer’s knowledge, this is the first time that scientists have found soils that don’t seem to support any kind of microbial life.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that exceedingly cold and arid conditions might place a hard limit on microbial habitability. The results also raise questions about how negative scientific results&nbsp;should be interpreted, especially in the search for life on other planets. “The challenge comes back to this sort of philosophical [question], how do you prove a negative?” Fierer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="269" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline.jpg" alt="Noah Fierer" class="wp-image-3101491" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline-330x131.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101491">Noah Fierer and colleagues found soil samples from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica that did not have traces of life, an unexpected observation since samples from the continent typically contain thousands of microbes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101491">Courtesy of N. Fierer</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Proving a negative result is notoriously difficult. No measurement is perfectly sensitive, which means there’s always a possibility that a well-executed experiment will fail to detect something that is actually there. It took years of experiments based on multiple, independent methods before Fierer of the University of Colorado Boulder and his collaborator Nick Dragone, finally felt confident enough to announce that they’d found seemingly microbe-free soils.&nbsp;And the scientists intentionally stated only that they were unable to detect life in their samples, not that the soils were naturally sterile.&nbsp;“We can’t say the soils are sterile. Nobody can say that,” Fierer says. “That’s a never-ending quest. There’s always another method or a variant of a method that you could try.”</p>



<p>Polar microbiologist Jeff Bowman sees the findings as an indication that current technology can&#8217;t detect very low levels of life, which can lead to false-negative results. “Certainly, there were things there,” says Bowman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. “This is Earth. This is an environment that is massively contaminated with life.” </p>



<p>Even if there were a few undetected microbes in the soil, said Dragone, that wouldn’t undermine his team’s evidence that cold and aridity pose a serious challenge to life. “It&#8217;s the combination of multiple very challenging environmental conditions that restricts life more than just one acting by itself,” says Dragone. “It&#8217;s a very different sort of restriction than, say, just high temperature.”</p>



<p>As scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">search for evidence of life beyond Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>), they will inevitably be forced to walk the line between evidence of absence and absence of evidence.&nbsp;“What we&#8217;re trying to do on Mars is kind of the reverse of what we&#8217;ve tried to do on Earth,” says polar microbiologist Lyle Whyte of McGill University in Montreal. On Earth, claiming that an environment is lifeless is a tough scientific sell. On Mars, it will be the other way around.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/658792610/0/oupblogpsychology/">“Stop acting like a child”: police denial of Black childhood</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rochester-police-pepper-spray-9-year-old-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>On 29 January 2021, Rochester police responded to an incident involving a Black nine-year-old girl, who they were told might be suicidal. An extended police <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/12/rochester-police-9-year-old/">body camera video of the incident</a> shows the agitated child, her mother, and an officer attempting to de-escalate the situation. The police detain the child by restraining her in handcuffs and placing her in the backseat of the police vehicle. Several of the nine officers who responded to the scene repeatedly threatened the child with pepper spray while detaining her. The child is shown begging the officers not to pepper spray her, crying hysterically, and repeatedly calling for her father. At one point, an officer says, “stop acting like a child,” to which she responds, “I am a child.” After the child is handcuffed and seated in the backseat of the police car, one of the police officers pepper sprays her and shuts the car door as the young girl screams inside.</p><p>As outrageous as this event was, it comports with existing psychological research conducted showing that people perceive Black children (but not White children) to be, on average, about <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://bma.issuelab.org/resources/21336/21336.pdf">4.5 years older</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">than they really are</a>. In turn, people deny Black children traits and attributes uniquely reserved for children—namely, childhood innocence—and, in turn, treat them more severely than White children, as if they were adults. Instead of attributing childhood innocence to the behavior of Black children, police instead dehumanize Black children (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://bma.issuelab.org/resources/21336/21336.pdf">implicitly associating them with apes</a>), and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">the more police officers dehumanize Black children, the more frequently they use physical force against Black (but not White) children</a>. The results of this research were so clearly demonstrated in real time by the Rochester police, who claimed to perceive an already detained and handcuffed Black, nine-year-old child to be a physical threat, in turn pepper-spraying her.</p><p>Although it is developmentally and psychologically normative for a nine-year-old to be fearful, cry, call for her father, and protest when multiple armed police officers attempt to detain her, the police in this instance instead blamed the nine-year-old for the event, attributing their use of force to her lack of cooperation. Indeed, at one point as the child begs to the officers, “Please don’t do this to me,” an officer is captured on camera telling the child, “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pepper-spray-girl-rochester-police-b1801659.html">You did it to yourself, hon</a>.” The officers’ behavior reflects a grave lack of knowledge regarding the unique developmental and psychological behavior of children, generally. Importantly, substantial evidence reveals that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">Black and White children do not differ in basic psychological, emotional, and cognitive development</a>. For instance, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">research shows</a> that across all racial groups, children and adolescents (relative to adults) are disproportionately impulsive, sensation-seeking oriented, susceptible to peer influence, and prefer risk-taking with short-term over long-term potential rewards. Relatedly, Black and White youth do not differ in the extent to which they engage in various risk-taking criminal behaviors, like drunk driving and drug abuse.</p><p>Despite the absence of racial differences in basic psychological development, juvenile and criminal court decision makers consistently <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">treat Black youth more harshly than White youth</a>. For instance, even though self-report data reveal that White youth report more drug abuse than Black youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/">Black youth are significantly more likely to be arrested for drug abuse</a>. Moreover, even after holding constant factors like offense seriousness, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">Black youth (relative to White youth) are disproportionately detained,</a> arrested, sentenced severely, transferred to adult criminal court, and treated punitively within probation. The disproportionately punitive treatment of Black relative to White youth offenders can be explained by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">negative racial stereotypes about recidivism potential, maturity, and culpability of Black youth</a>, as well as dehumanization and the denial of childhood innocence of Black youth.</p><p>Notably, the Rochester police were not responding to a call involving criminal offending. Instead, they were responding to a call involving a mental health crisis—specifically, a suicidal nine-year-old child. Yet, substantial research suggests that otherwise ambiguous and developmentally normative child behavior (i.e., “loitering” or “disrespect”) is misinterpreted as “dangerous” <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-8">and more frequently treated punitively with discipline when the child is Black than White</a>. The negative downstream consequences for racial minority youth are myriad. For instance, being stereotyped by police officers causes anxiety among Black youth—anxiety that has the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">potential to prevent them from calling police in an emergency situation</a>. Importantly, racial minorities who experience police brutality directly or vicariously (witnessing the abuse of others) are disproportionately likely to experience <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12251">negative mental health consequences</a> including anger, fear, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The implications of this research for the nine-year-old in Rochester are grim. To the extent that police use-of-force on an otherwise mentally healthy adult triggers mental illness, the negative mental health consequences of police-use-of-force on a suicidal nine-year-old child are likely even more serious.</p><p>As harmful as this experience of individual racism likely was for this nine-year-old, it is important to consider the impact of systemic and institutionalized racism affecting racial minority children within the justice systems. Negative experiences like these, which are disproportionately experienced by Black youth, set the stage for cascading and cumulatively negative future outcomes, occurring at each decision-point within the justice system (i.e., arrest, detainment, bail, verdicts, sentencing, probation, etc.). Understanding early experiences of racial minority youth is critical for understanding the scope of the disproportionately negative outcomes experienced by racial minority adults within the justice systems. Psychological scientists ought to continue conducting research to expose the unjust and damaging experiences of racial minority children within the legal system. Importantly, their work should not end in the lab. Instead, psychologists ought to use this research to advocate for law and policy change to end the disproportionately harmful impact of racism on the lives of children.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/658792610/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/658792610/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f07%2frochester-police-pepper-spray-9-year-old-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/whitman-and-the-america-yet-to-be/">Whitman and the America yet to be: reconceptualizing a multiracial democracy</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pika-yak-poop-winter-slow-metabolism-yak-biology">Pikas survive winter using a slower metabolism and, at times, yak poop</a></h4>

              
                <p>Winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is unfriendly to pikas. Temperatures across the barren, windy highlands routinely dip below –30° Celsius, and the grass that typically sustains the rabbitlike mammals becomes dry and brittle. It would seem the perfect time for these critters to hibernate, or subsist on stores of grass in burrows to stay warm, like the North American pika.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, plateau pika (<em>Ochotona curzoniae</em>) continue foraging in winter, but <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100707118">reduce their metabolism by about 30 percent</a> to conserve energy, researchers report July 19 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> Some pikas also resort to unusual rations: yak poop.</p>



<p>Camera data from four sites confirmed that pikas regularly brave the cold to forage. “Clearly they’re doing something fancy with their metabolism that’s not hibernation,” says John Speakman, an ecophysiologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p>



<p>Speakman and colleagues measured daily energy expenditure of 156 plateau pikas in summer and winter, and implanted 27 animals with temperature sensors. While many nonhibernating animals keep warm in winter by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/eight-ways-animals-survive-winter">using more energy</a>, these pikas did the opposite (<em>SN: 1/22/14</em>). On average, pikas reduced their metabolism by 29.7 percent, in part by cooling their bodies a couple degrees overnight. The animals were also less active, relative to summertime levels.</p>





<p>But at sites with yaks, pikas were more abundant but even less active. That puzzled the researchers “until we found a sort of half-eaten yak turd in one of the burrows,” Speakman says.&nbsp;Eating excrement can cause sickness. But with few options, yak poop could be an abundant, easily digestible meal that “massively reduces the amount of time [pikas] need to spend on the surface,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers caught pikas scarfing scat on video, and DNA evidence from stomach contents solidified that this behavior is common. Whether dining on dung has downsides remains to be seen, but clearly, not being too picky pays off for pika.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/kp4x1NIC-3A/">Engaging with article metrics: own your impact narrative</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>As <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/a-farewell-to-alm-but-not-to-article-level-metrics/">we wrote back in March</a>, PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of metrics at the article level. The move to article-level metrics (often known as altmetrics) is &ldquo;<a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>defined</em></a><em> by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Article-level metrics/altmetrics have always been presented as alternatives to solely relying on traditional shorthand assessments like total citation counts and the reductive Journal Impact Factor. Hopefully, a <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/mwtang/ifuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed critique</a> of the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/"> perils and misuse</a> of journal-level impact metrics is not needed in this day and age, suffice to repeat that it is unscientific to convey more credit and reward to one researcher&rsquo;s article over another&rsquo;s based solely upon the Journal Impact Factor of the venue of publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re hopeful that culture is changing, thanks to&nbsp;the efforts of <a href="https://sfdora.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DORA</a> and other organizations advocating, and now providing <a href="https://sfdora.org/dora-case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concrete guidance</a>, for the responsible use of metrics in research assessment. Also, some funders, like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), are <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/biomedical-research/investigator-program/review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making explicit</a> how they review their HHMI Investigators, clearly encouraging them to tell the full story of their impact beyond a simple publication record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers like you can help. The purpose of this post is to empower researchers to engage with a variety of accessible altmetrics, and signals of rigorous research practice, to define your research article&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;impact narrative&rdquo; and more effectively showcase its strengths.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What metrics and signals can articles offer?</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing and highlighting your article-level metrics helps<strong> </strong>facilitate and normalize more appropriate assessment. When relying on metrics to describe your work, use detailed metrics that are <strong>specific to your article </strong>such as:</p>



<ul><li>Citations over time</li><li>Usage over time</li><li>Attention (beyond citations) over time (e.g. from news outlets, policies, social media) often measured as &ldquo;altmetrics&rdquo;</li></ul>



<p>The data displayed on PLOS articles&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metrics</a>&rdquo; tab showcases how many times the article has been viewed, cited, saved, and discussed, and clicking on any of the sections opens up the details (e.g. which articles have cited this article).</p>



<p>Metrics can also be enhanced by other knowable signals that convey specific qualities about your article. Some of the most general of these are listed below:</p>



<ul><li>Peer-review status</li><li>Open availability of peer review report/decision letters</li><li>Availability of Open data/code/protocols/materials</li><li>Adherence to relevant ethical standards for research</li><li>Adherence to standards for rigorous research reporting (e.g. those of <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EQUATOR network</a>, <a href="https://arriveguidelines.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARRIVE</a>, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MDAR</a>)</li></ul>



<p>At PLOS, to showcase peer-review status, all articles show the Editor who handled the submission, the peer review timeline, and, if the authors chose the option, the published peer review report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When publishing your research, you can make choices that help you demonstrate your commitment to rigor and credibility. When publishing with PLOS you <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commit to share your underlying data</a>. You may also choose to <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share your protocols, your code, to pre-register your study, and to publish the peer review history of your papers</a>. These are important choices that affirm your commitment to transparency and to your results being available to the scientific community to build upon. You can highlight these choices too, in addition to metrics!</p>



<p><strong>Which metrics and signals should I use to tell my Impact Narrative?</strong></p>



<p>To establish an effective Impact Narrative, showcase altmetrics that are the most <strong>relevant to the intentions of your research. </strong>Below are some ways this could be done. None of the examples below are mutually exclusive, researchers could be electing to promote all of these qualities:</p>



<h4><strong>Impact narratives: examples</strong></h4>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>We encourage showcasing the signals of rigorous research practices. We encourage <em>engagement</em>, but not obsession, with metrics. Article-level metrics and altmetrics are intended to be useful, and metrics themselves are neutral, but any metric has the potential to be misused, over-interpreted, over-engineered, and gamed, by actors invested in a system. Therefore, here at PLOS, we believe the key is to always:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Be transparent</strong> (e.g. show the maximum or most accurate detail available, even if an average or total is displayed or used)</li><li><strong>Engage with metrics and signals</strong> to ensure <em>you </em>own the way they should relate to you (e.g. create own your impact narrative)</li></ul>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command&nbsp;line.</p>
<p>The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>* While MacOS has switched from <code>bash</code> to <code>zsh</code> as its default shell, <code>zsh</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this&nbsp;tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar&nbsp;territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course&nbsp;Git.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">enable <span class="caps">WSL2</span></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6">install Ubuntu</a> as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux&nbsp;territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and&nbsp;patience)</li>
<li>The grammar of a shell command&nbsp;line</li>
<li>Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: <code>~</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pushd</code>/<code>popd</code>, <code>ssh</code></li>
<li>Seeing what&#8217;s there: <code>ls</code>, globbing, and strategies for naming your&nbsp;files</li>
<li>File system manipulations: <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>/<code>scp</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>ln -s</code>, <code>touch</code></li>
<li>Looking into files: <code>cat</code>, <code>head</code> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <code>tail</code>, <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>diff</code></li>
<li>Text manipulation: <code>sed</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>column</code></li>
<li>Putting things together: piping and&nbsp;redirection</li>
<li>What to do when stuck: <code>man</code>, I need some <code>help</code> here <code>apropos</code> of this&nbsp;command&#8230;</li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be&nbsp;required.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:<ul>
<li>Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install git</code></li>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install git</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows users should use <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>.</li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We&#8217;ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows&nbsp;users)</li>
<li>Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on&nbsp;installation)</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-centaurus-a-galaxy-massive-jets-event-horizon">The latest picture of a black hole captures Centaurus A’s massive jets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Event Horizon Telescope is expanding its portfolio of black hole images.</p>



<p>In 2019, the telescope unveiled the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a>, revealing the supermassive beast 55 million light-years from Earth at the center of galaxy M87 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That lopsided orange ring showed the shadow of the black hole on its glowing accretion disk of infalling material. Since then, observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, have yielded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-eht-data-m87-black-hole-turbulence-wobble">more detailed views</a> of M87’s black hole (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). Now, EHT data have revealed new details of the supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy near our own, called Centaurus A.</p>



<p>Rather than zooming in close enough to see the black hole’s shadow, the new picture offers the clearest view yet of the powerful plasma jets erupting from the black hole. This perspective gives insight into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01417-w">how supermassive black holes blast such plasma jets into space</a>, researchers report online July 19 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a fairly impressive feat,” says radio astronomer Craig Walker of capturing the new high-resolution image. “These [jets] are some of the most powerful things in the universe,” says Walker, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., who was not involved in the work. Because such superfast plasma streams are thought to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-first-image-black-hole-questions">influence how galaxies grow and evolve</a>, astronomers are keen to understand how the jets form (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers pointed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">global network of radio dishes</a> that make up the EHT at Centaurus A for six hours in April 2017, during the same observing run that delivered the first picture of a black hole (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). About 12 million light-years from Earth, Centaurus A is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky and is known for the huge jets expelled by its central black hole.</p>



<p>“They extend to pretty much the entire scale of the galaxy,” says Michael Janssen, a radio astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. “If we were to see radio light [with our eyes], and we were to look at the night sky, then we would see these jets of Centaurus A as a structure that is 16 times bigger than the full moon.”</p>



<p>Using the EHT, Janssen and colleagues homed in on the base of those jets, which gush out from either side of the black hole’s accretion disk. The new image is 16 times as sharp as previous observations of the jets, probing details less than one light-day across — about four times the distance from the sun to Pluto. One of the most striking features that the image reveals is that only the outer edges of the jets seem to glow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="339" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071621_mt_event-horizon_inline_680.jpg" alt="images of jets from the black hole in the galaxy Centaurus A" class="wp-image-3101599" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071621_mt_event-horizon_inline_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071621_mt_event-horizon_inline_680-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101599">The supermassive black hole in the galaxy Centaurus A launches two jets of plasma in opposite directions (zoomed-out view of the jets at left). In a new close-up view taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (at right; estimated location of the black hole indicated with an arrow), the jet moving toward Earth points toward the image’s top left, with two bright edges and a dark center. The jet moving away from Earth, also bright only at the edges, points toward the bottom right.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101599">M. Janssen <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s still a puzzle,” Janssen says. One possibility is that the jets are rotating, which might cause material in some regions of the jets to emit light toward Earth, while others don’t. Or the jets could be hollow, Janssen says.</p>



<p>Recent observations of a few other galaxies have hinted that the jets of supermassive black holes are brighter around the edges, says Denise Gabuzda, an astrophysicist at University College Cork in Ireland, who wasn’t involved in the work. “But it’s been hard to know whether it was a common feature, or whether it was something quirky about the few that had been observed.”</p>



<p>The new view of Centaurus A’s black hole provides evidence that this edge-brightening is common, Gabuzda says. “It’s fairly rare to be able to detect the jets coming out in both directions, but in the images of Centaurus A … you can clearly see that both of them are brighter at the edges.”</p>



<p>The next step will be to compare the EHT image of Centaurus A with computer simulations based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity, to test how well relativity holds up in this extreme environment, Janssen says. Examining the polarization, or orientation, of the light waves emanating from Centaurus A’s jets could also reveal the structure of their magnetic fields — just as polarization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">revealed the magnetism around M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-endangered-bonobos-nests">Climate change may be leading to overcounts of endangered bonobos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change is interfering with how researchers count bonobos, possibly leading to gross overestimates of the endangered apes, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Like other great apes, bonobos build elevated nests out of tree branches and foliage to sleep in. Counts of these nests can be used to estimate numbers of bonobos — as long as researchers have a good idea of how long a nest sticks around before it’s broken down by the environment, what’s known as the nest decay time.</p>



<p>New data on rainfall and bonobo nests show that the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252527">nests are persisting longer in the forests in Congo</a>, from roughly 87 days, on average, in 2003–2007 to about 107 days in 2016–2018, largely as a result of declining precipitation. This increase in nests’ decay time could be dramatically skewing population counts of the endangered apes and imperiling conservation efforts, researchers report June 30 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“Imagine going in that forest &#8230; you count nests, but each single nest is around longer than it used to be 15 years ago, which means that you think that there are more bonobos than there really are,” says Barbara Fruth, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.</p>





<p>Lowland tropical forests, south of the Congo River in Africa, are the only place in the world where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-first-great-apes-adopt-orphan-infant-outside-group">bonobos</a> (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) still live in the wild (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). Estimates suggest that there are at least 15,000 to 20,000 bonobos there. But there could be as many as 50,000 individuals. “The area of potential distribution is rather big, but there have been very few surveys,” Fruth says.</p>



<p>From 2003 to 2007, and then again from 2016 to 2018, Fruth and colleagues followed wild bonobos in Congo’s LuiKotale rain forest, monitoring 1,511 nests. “The idea is that you follow [the bonobos] always,” says Mattia Bessone, a wildlife researcher at the Liverpool John Moores University in England. “You need to be up early in the morning so that you can be at the spot where the bonobos have nested, in time for them to wake up, and then you follow them till they nest again.”</p>



<p>In doing so, day after day, Fruth, Bessone and colleagues were first able to understand how many nests a bonobo builds in a day, what’s known as the nest construction rate. “It’s not necessarily one because sometimes bonobos build day nests,” Bessone says. On average, each bonobo builds 1.3 nests per day, the team found.</p>



<p>Tracking how long these nests stuck around revealed that the structures were lasting an average of 19 days longer in 2016–2018 than in 2003–2007. The researchers also compiled fifteen years of climate data for LuiKotale, which showed a decrease in average rainfall from 2003 to 2018. That change in rain is linked to climate change, the researchers say, and helps explain why nests have become more resilient.</p>

Fruth/MPI of Animal Behavior</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>By counting the numbers of nests and then dividing that number by the product of the average nest decay time and nest construction rate, scientists can get an estimate of the number of bonobos in a region. But if researchers are using outdated, shorter nest decay times, those estimates could be severely off, overestimating bonobo counts by up to 50 percent, Bessone says.</p>



<p>“The results are not surprising but also highlight how indirect (and therefore prone to errors) our methods of density estimates of many species are,” Martin Surbeck, a behavioral ecologist at Harvard University, wrote in an e-mail.</p>



<p>Technologies such as camera traps can be used to directly count animals instead of using proxies like nests and are the way forward for animal population studies, researchers say.  But until those methods become more common, nest counts remain vital for scientists’ understanding of bonobo numbers.</p>



<p>This phenomenon is probably not limited to bonobos. All great apes build nests, and nest counts are used to estimate those animals’ numbers too. So, the researchers say, the new results could have implications for the conservation of primates far beyond bonobos.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-our-dna-is-uniquely-human">Only a tiny fraction of our DNA is uniquely human</a></h4>

              
                <p>The genetic tweaks that make humans uniquely human may come in small parcels interspersed with DNA inherited from extinct ancestors and cousins.</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc0776">1.5 percent to 7 percent</a> of the collective human genetic instruction book, or genome, contains uniquely human DNA, researchers report July 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That humans-only DNA, scattered throughout the genome, tends to contain genes involved in brain development and function, hinting that brain evolution was important in making humans human. But the researchers don’t yet know exactly what the genes do and how the exclusively human tweaks to DNA near those genes may have affected brain evolution.</p>



<p>“I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to say what makes us uniquely human,” says Emilia Huerta-Sanchez, a population geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. “We don’t know whether that makes us think in a specific way or have specific behaviors.” And Neandertals and Denisovans, both extinct human cousins, may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-art-suggests-neandertals-were-ancient-humans-mental-equals">thought much like humans</a> do (<em>SN: 2/22/18</em>).</p>





<p>The results don’t mean that individual people are mostly Neandertal or Denisovan, or some other mix of ancient hominid. On average, people in sub-Saharan Africa inherited 0.096 percent to 0.46 percent of their DNA from ancient <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">interbreeding between their human ancestors and Neandertals</a>, the researchers found (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>). Non-Africans inherited more DNA from Neandertals: about 0.73 percent to 1.3 percent. And some people inherited a fraction of their DNA from Denisovans as well.</p>



<p>Using a new computational method, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz examined every spot of DNA in the genomes of 279 people. The team compiled results from those individual genomes into a collective picture of the human genome. For each spot, the team determined whether the DNA came from Denisovans, Neandertals or was inherited from a common ancestor of humans and those long-lost relatives.</p>



<p>Although each person may carry about 1 percent Neandertal DNA, “if you look at a couple hundred people, they mostly won’t have their bit of Neandertal DNA in the same place,” says Kelley Harris, a population geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the work. “So if you add up all the regions where someone has a bit of Neandertal DNA, that pretty soon covers most of the genome.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, about 50 percent of the collective genome contains regions where one or more people inherited DNA from Neandertals or Denisovans, the researchers discovered. Most of the rest of the genome has been passed down from the most recent common ancestor of humans and their extinct cousins. After whittling away the ancient heirloom DNA, the team looked for regions where all people have human-specific tweaks to DNA that no other species have. That got the estimate of uniquely human DNA down to anywhere between 1.5 percent and 7 percent of the genome.</p>



<p>The finding underscores just how much interbreeding with other hominid species affected the human genome, says coauthor Nathan Schaefer, a computational biologist now at the University of California, San Francisco. The researchers confirmed previous findings from other groups that humans bred with Neandertals and Denisovans, but also with other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-west-africans-may-have-dna-genes-ancient-ghost-hominid">extinct, unknown hominids</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>). It’s not known whether those mysterious ancestors are the groups that included “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">Dragon Man”</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-fossil-new-hominid-nesher-ramla-homo-human-evolution">Nesher Ramla <em>Homo</em></a>, which may be closer relatives to humans than Neandertals (<em>SN: 6/25/21; SN: 6/24/21</em>). And the mixing and mingling probably happened multiple times between different groups of humans and hominids, Schaefer and colleagues found.</p>



<p>The tweaks that make the uniquely human DNA distinctive arose in a couple of evolutionary bursts, probably around 600,000 years ago and again about 200,000 years ago, the team found. Around 600,000 years ago is about the time that humans and Neandertals were forming their own branches of the hominid family tree.</p>



<p>The estimate of the amount of uniquely human DNA doesn’t take into account places where humans have gained DNA through duplication or other means, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancestral-humans-had-more-dna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost it</a>, says James Sikela, a genome scientist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora who wasn’t involved in the study (<em>SN: 8/6/15).&nbsp;</em>Such extra or missing DNA may have allowed humans to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/missing-bits-dna-may-define-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evolve new traits</a>, including some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-tweaks-built-humans-bigger-brains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involved in brain evolution</a> (<em>SN: 3/9/11; SN: 2/26/15</em>).</p>



<p>Ancient DNA usually has been degraded into tiny fragments and researchers have pieced together only portions the genomes from extinct hominids. The fragmented genomes make it difficult to tell where big chunks of DNA may have been lost or gained. For that reason, the researchers studied only small tweaks to DNA involving one or more DNA bases — the information-carrying parts of the molecule. Given that humans and Neandertals went their separate evolutionary ways relatively recently, it’s not surprising that only 7 percent or less of the genome has evolved the uniquely human tweaks, Sikela says. “I’m not shocked by that number.” Considering DNA that humans alone have added to their genomes might produce a higher estimate of exclusively human DNA, he says.</p>



<p>Or it could go the other way. As more genomes are deciphered from Neandertals, Denisovans and other extinct hominids, researchers may discover that some of what now seems like uniquely human DNA was also carried by those extinct relatives, Harris says. “This estimate of the amount of uniquely human regions is only going to go down.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/iStock-1201820577.t5fbfae93.m800.xqufReeZZ-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>With the number of potential kidney transplant recipients exceeding available organs, there is a tremendous focus on reducing discard rates of allografts and increasing the number of live donors. In the US, there are 107,000 individuals on the wait list for kidney transplant with about 30,000 transplants performed annually in the US. Worldwide about 95,000 kidney transplants were performed with the majority occurring in North America and Europe. There has been a parallel initiative to promote the option of transplantation through education and awareness campaigns. These programs are needed to support the overall goal of availability of transplant for those that are medically eligible recipients. Since transplant is a such a limited resource, equally important to closing the gap of people wait-listed for transplant and availability of allografts should be work on preserving/prolonging allograft survival.</p>
<p>Polyoma virus BK Nephropathy (PVBKN) is a challenging issue in transplant.  While PVBKN has an incidence of less than 10% of transplant recipients, it can lead to significant graft loss through rejection episodes and difficulty in clearing the virus  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.14314">https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.14314</a>.   Early detection of the virus can provide a window for reduction of immunosuppression and possible use of antiviral agents to allow for allograft preservation.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02444-5">Nili et al</a>. in a recently published study looked at the use of immunohistochemistry studies of biopsies to enhance the diagnosis of PVBKN, Histopathologic evaluation, the gold standard, detects nuclear viral inclusion bodies. The addition of immunohistochemistry staining for SV40 picked up additional cases of PVBKN not noted to have the classic pathologic changes. These cases were hypothesized to be identified earlier in the evolution of the PVBKN.</p>
<p>Noninvasive testing has not provided a consistent reliable means for diagnosis as the degree of viremia and viruria may not correlate with disease. Given that most cases of allograft dysfunction will be evaluated by renal biopsy and the addition of the immunohistochemistry staining for SV40 is widely available and low cost, this seems an approach that should be adopted by transplant centers as routine. This may be more feasible than surveillance of screening for viruria or viremia for many years as there is the potential for PVBKN many years post transplantation. Another key factor to keep in mind is that many transplant recipients may not be followed by transplant nephrologists or transplant centers for routine care and may not be getting surveillance screening of blood and urine due to cost or availability of resources. The ability for early diagnosis and intervention to help preserve allograft function even for a few cases would be valuable for long term allograft preservation. This study highlights the need to continue efforts toward improving allograft survival and identify cost effective interventions that can readily be incorporated by many centers.  Ongoing dissemination of best practices is another key part of the improving care.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lakes-liquid-water-south-pole-ice-cap-mirages">Lakes of liquid water at Mars’ southern ice cap may just be mirages</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe hold off on that Martian ice fishing trip. Two new studies splash cold water on the idea that potentially habitable lakes of liquid water exist deep under the Red Planet’s southern polar ice cap.</p>



<p>The possibility of a lake roughly 20 kilometers across was first raised in 2018, when the European Space Agency’s Mars Express spacecraft probed the planet’s southern polar cap with its Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, or MARSIS, instrument. The orbiter detected bright spots on radar measurements, hinting at a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid-water-search-life">large body of liquid water</a> beneath 1.5 kilometers of solid ice that could be an abode to living organisms (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/25/18</em>). Subsequent work found hints of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-south-pole-ice-surrounded-pools-water">additional pools surrounding the main lake basin</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the planetary science community has always held some skepticism over the lakes’ existence, which would require some kind of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-underground-volcano">continuous geothermal heating</a> to maintain subglacial conditions (<em>SN: 2/19/19</em>). Below the ice, temperatures average –68° Celsius, far past the freezing point of water, even if the lakes are a brine containing a healthy amount of salt, which lowers water’s freezing point. An underground magma pool would be needed to keep the area liquid — an unlikely scenario given Mars’ lack of present-day volcanism.</p>



<p>“If it’s not liquid water, is there something else that could explain the bright radar reflections we’re seeing?” asks planetary scientist Carver Bierson of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>





<p>In a study published in the July 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>, Bierson and colleagues describe a couple other substances that could explain the reflections. Radar’s reflectivity depends on the electrical conductivity of the material the radar signal moves through. Liquid water has a fairly distinctive radar signature, but examining the electrical properties of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL093880">both clay minerals and frozen brine revealed those materials could mimic this signal</a>.</p>



<p>Adding weight to the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL093631">non-lake explanation</a> is a study from an independent team, published in the same issue of <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. The initial 2018 watery findings were based on MARSIS data focused on a small section of the southern ice cap, but the instrument has now built up three-dimensional maps of the entire south pole, where hundreds to thousands of additional bright spots appear.</p>



<p>“We find them literally all over the region,” says planetary scientist Aditya Khuller, also of Arizona State University. “These signatures aren’t unique. We see them in places where we expect it to be really cold.”</p>



<p>Creating plausible scenarios to maintain liquid water in all of these locations would be a tough exercise. Both Khuller and Bierson think it is far more likely that MARSIS is pointing to some kind of widespread geophysical process that created minerals or frozen brines.</p>



<p>While previous work had already raised doubts about the lake interpretation, these additional data points might represent the pools’ death knell. “Putting these two papers together with the other existing literature, I would say this puts us at 85 percent confidence that this is not a lake,” says Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a planetary scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston who was not involved in either study.</p>



<p>The lakes, if they do exist, would likely be extremely cold and contain as much as 50 percent salt — conditions in which no known organisms on Earth can survive. Given that, the pools <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">wouldn’t make particularly strong astrobiological targets</a> anyway, Rivera-Valentín says. (<em>SN</em><em>: 5/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>Lab work exploring how substances react to conditions at Mars’ southern polar ice cap could help further constrain what generates the bright radar spots, Bierson says.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Khuller already has his eye on other areas of potential habitability on the Red Planet, such as warmer midlatitude regions where satellites have seen evidence of ice melting in the sun. “I think there are places where liquid water could be on Mars today,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s at the south pole.”&nbsp;</p>

While the targeting of hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure levels are important as potential determinants of risk of morbidity and mortality, optimization of these parameters only addresses some of the factors relevant to different outcomes.</p>
<p>In a previous issue, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02277-2">Ozieh et al.</a> looked at the individual and cumulative impact of social determinants of health (depression, food insecurity, poverty level) on all cause mortality of 1376 individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Social determinants of health were significantly associated with mortality even with adjustments for demographics, lifestyle variables, glycemic control, and comorbidities. Depression was independently associated with mortality. Individuals with the presence of all 3 areas had a 41% higher risk of death. There has been recognition by health care providers that socioeconomic factors affect health in terms of access to care, health literacy, and adherence to treatment but the extent of the impact has been underestimated.</p>
<p>With the challenge of packed office/clinic schedules and numerous competing health conditions needing evaluation, the ability to spend time to understand the economic situations or characteristics of a patient’s life is not often available. Physicians may be limiting the ability to treat patients without that information. This understanding would serve to strengthen the provider-patient relationship. Perhaps the approach for the initial assessment for diabetes care, chronic kidney disease or hypertension care would include questions to gauge food insecurity, ability to follow specific diet, or ability to get to appointments.This information would allow creation of feasible plans of care and eliminate the usually inaccurate assumptions that an individual not following a prescribed treatment is a result of lack of care by the patient.</p>
<p>In the last few years, newer agents, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, have been introduced for management of diabetes with the promise of improved cardiac and renal outcomes. These agents are often expensive and often challenging to get insurance coverage. As research and pharmaceutical development brings us newer options for treatment, we need to remember that only addressing the biochemical parameters with therapeutics will not completely address the health impact of many of our chronic diseases. We need to advocate for investment in case management and social interventions at the same time.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about a paper &quot;Clustering Functional Data into Groups by Using Projections&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We show that, in the functional data context, by appropriately exploiting the
functional nature of the data, it is possible to cluster the observations
asymptotically perfectly. We demonstrate that this level of performance can
sometimes be achieved by the k -means algorithm as long as the data are
projected on a carefully chosen finite dimensional space. In general, the
notion of an ideal cluster is not clearly defined. We derive our results in the
setting where the data come from two populations whose distributions differ at
least in terms of means, and where an ideal cluster corresponds to one of these
two populations. We propose an iterative algorithm to choose the projection
functions in a way that optimizes clustering performance, where, to avoid
peculiar solutions, we use a weighted least squares criterion. We apply our
iterative clustering procedure on simulated and real data, where we show that
it works well.</p>

In fact, work suggests that 6-7% of the general population <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_lnP3QL0c">hear voices that don’t exist</a>. However, exactly what predisposes well people to experience them has not been clear. Now a major new study of 1,394 people native to 46 different countries, led by Peter Moseley at Northumbria University, provides support for two hypotheses from earlier, smaller studies — namely, that a history of childhood trauma and a propensity to hear non-existent speech among background noise are both associated with experiencing hallucinations — but does not support three others.</p>



<p>“In terms of reproducibility, these results may be a cause for concern in hallucinations research (and cognitive and clinical psychology more broadly),” writes the team in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620985832">their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>. In firming up a few ideas, the work does, though, help to clarify what aspects of cognition as well as past experience are — and are not — linked to being more prone to hallucinations.</p>



<span id="more-42846"></span>



<p>The participants came into one of 11 data collection labs (in the UK, France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Canada, Norway and Australia) or participated online. They completed two scales that measured hallucinatory experiences, such as hearing, seeing or smelling something when there was nothing to explain those perceptions. They also reported on incidences of childhood trauma (being regularly criticised by a parent, for example). And they completed a series of tasks that tapped into cognitive processes identified in earlier work as being linked to hallucinations in the general population, as well as in patient groups.</p>



<p>The team found that experience of childhood trauma and performance on just the &#8220;auditory signal detection task&#8221; was linked to hallucinations. That task (which was completed by only the 594 participants who visited the labs) measured the participants’ ability to tell whether or not brief clips of speech had been played during longer bursts of noise. Those who scored higher on the hallucinatory scales had a higher false alarm rate — they were more likely to report hearing a voice when none was present. This data supports the previously proposed idea that hallucinations are linked to the brain over-relying on <em>expectations</em> of what will be perceived, vs actual sensory input. A higher false alarm rate on this kind of task is also seen in patients with schizophrenia, as is a history of adverse experiences in childhood.</p>



<p>However, in contrast to what has been found for patient groups and smaller, earlier studies of the general population, there was no association between hallucinatory experiences and results on tests of &#8220;dichotic listening&#8221; (which assessed the degree to which language processing was lateralised), &#8220;source memory&#8221; (remembering whether they’d actually heard or only imagined hearing various words) or verbal working memory. So, it seems that for well people who hallucinate, a failure to distinguish between what they have imagined vs what they have actually sensed, for example, doesn’t seem to be a cause. This adds to recent <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/24/a-key-brain-difference-between-voice-hearing-patients-and-voice-hearing-healthy-controls-challenges-the-continuum-model/">doubts about the idea of a &#8220;continuum model&#8221;</a> for voice-hearing, which theorises that patients are simply further along the same voice-hearing spectrum as people in the general population who hear voices.</p>



<p>However, given the previously small sample sizes, lack of standardisation of studies on patients, and sparsity of direct replications, it’s hard to be sure whether hallucinations in well vs mentally unwell people have fundamentally different causes. “Further preregistered studies with large samples in these groups are needed,” the team writes. That work would not only help to further address the reproducibility issues in this field of research, but hopefully also clarify the mechanisms underlying hallucinations in general.</p>

Teledentistry supports the delivery of oral health services through electronic communication means, connecting providers and patients without the usual time and space constraints. Teledentistry&#8217;s unique ability to connect disadvantaged, rural communities and the home-bound with dental providers makes this method particularly well-suited to address the lack of access during and after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Teledentistry can be used for consultation and triage, allowing providers to advise patients whether their dental concerns constitute a need for urgent or emergency care, whether a condition could be temporarily alleviated at home, or whether treatment could be postponed. Teledentistry and distance learning can also be used to facilitate access to preventive services and oral health education.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/people-3039696_640-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>We estimate that over 3% of the world’s population required humanitarian aid in 2020. As temperatures rise and weather patterns shift, one can only imagine the number of people and financial resources needed to provide services if we continue unabated on this current dangerous path. We lack accurate figures but hypothesize that the destruction of formal structures and social safety nets during natural disasters will likely lead to increases in violence against children.</p>
<p>When disaster strikes, we often do not have time to ask questions of how and why violence occurs. We create research that is responsive and immediate, focusing on enumeration of children at highest risk of violence or top concerns of affected communities. However, if we do not understand fully which aspects of the disaster leads to violence, how can we prevent it?</p>
<p>This question has echoed in my head many times over the years, as I spent the better part of a decade conducting research on child protection violations in humanitarian emergencies. Those who work in disaster response and humanitarian emergencies are guided by the premise that we do not cause harm, and therefore, our interventions are needed and justified. Corresponding research is process driven to improve upon existing service delivery. I often wondered if we could create a more public health approach that targets the upstream drivers of violence.</p>
<p>Our systematic review published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> collates information on the potential pathways between natural disasters and violence against children to suggest points of intervention. We identified five pathways to violence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environmentally induced changes in supervision, accompaniment, and child separation</li>
<li>Transgression of social norms in post-disaster behavior</li>
<li>Economic stress</li>
<li>Negative coping with stress</li>
<li>Insecure shelter and living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The findings have three major implications for action. First, while it is likely that a greater number of pathways exists, given the scarcity of the evidence, we can say with assurance that intervening on each of these aspects of the post-disaster environment would help to prevent violence. Violence prevention programming should structure interventions that target these five pathways after natural disasters.</p>
<p>We have a wealth of evidence-based interventions that can be utilized; for instance, <em>SASA!</em> (meaning “now” in Kiswahili) for social norms change, <em>Parents Make the Difference</em> for positive parenting, and <em>Cure Violence</em> for creating safe environments. Global standards in the <em>Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPMS)</em> and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) <em>INSPIRE: Seven Strategies for Ending Violence against Children</em> should be met in building interventions.</p>
<p>Second, we should leverage the already existing knowledge and resilience of communities whom often experience natural disasters cyclically. We found that some families and communities were able to protect children from violence after natural disasters, particularly in terms of creating new accompaniment and supervision structures. Natural disasters may be unique from armed conflict in that community trust is greater intact.</p>
<p>We should look to indigenous knowledge that bolsters local response. These strategies are likely to be effective, more easily promoted than external interventions, and supportive of efforts to localize response. We highly encourage greater documentation and evaluation of positive behaviors after natural disasters that work to prevent violence.</p>
<p>Third, multi-pronged approaches are essential in preventing violence. The five outlined pathways individually lead to violence but do not act in isolation. Programming must be created to combat multiple pathways.</p>
<p>Suppose a service provider creates a livelihoods program to address the economic stress pathway to violence. Unconditional cash transfers are provided to women heads of household in an effort to ensure that money is used for family needs. Violence against women and children may still occur in societies where it transgresses gender norms for women to be breadwinners of households. Humanitarians may cause more harm than good if they do not bundle livelihoods interventions with social norms change.</p>
<p>The livelihoods intervention further does not alleviate other negative coping behaviors. Violence against children may still occur if women caregivers are not provided with parenting programs and mental health support to cope with acute and ongoing stress from the natural disaster.</p>

<p>Without addressing all pathways, violence against children will likely continue to occur. Individual agencies should design comprehensive interventions that address multiple pathways to violence, and humanitarian coordination mechanisms can ensure that no gaps exist in government and agency services.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Multiple factors influence how we perform educationally: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/22/school-kids-memory-is-better-for-material-delivered-with-enthusiasm-because-it-grabs-their-attention/">the way</a> we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/18/teachers-show-biases-against-overweight-kids-including-giving-them-lower-grades/">taught</a>, our particular <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/27/students-with-adhd-arent-always-given-the-support-they-need-to-thrive-at-university/">needs</a> and how they’re met, our parents, and our <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439867/RR439B-Ethnic_minorities_and_attainment_the_effects_of_poverty_annex.pdf.pdf">socio-economic background</a> to name a few. Gaps in attainment can start from very early on: some children have already <a href="https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/too_young_to_fail/too_young_to_fail_-_oct_2013.pdf">fallen behind</a> before the age of seven.</p>



<p>But what about how much we <em>enjoy</em> school? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-021-00092-w">new study</a> in <em>npj Science of Learning</em>, led by the University of Bristol’s Tim Morris, looks at this relatively under-explored factor. And the team finds that enjoyment at the age of six has a significant impact on achievement, which was visible even years later when participants took their GCSEs.</p>



<span id="more-42841"></span>



<p>Data was gathered from participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which has been tracking parents and their children from 1991 onwards. At the age of six, participants were asked if they liked school, before answering further questions on their enjoyment six months later.</p>



<p>Educational attainment was measured through exam results aged 16, and the team also looked at sex, month of birth and school year, ethnicity, cognitive ability aged eight, maternal education and the socioeconomic position of parents. Mothers who took part in the study also reported how much their children liked their teachers aged six, and children themselves self-reported their temperament by answering questions on how happy or angry they were.</p>



<p>From the age of eight, children answered questions on their confidence in their work and intelligence, as well as how happy they were with their number of friends and the quality of their friendships. Finally, the team looked at the home learning environment through questions on how families taught their children colours, language, numbers, songs and shapes and sizes.</p>



<p>There was no relationship between school enjoyment and parental socioeconomic status: those who had parents in so-called &#8220;skilled&#8221; occupations were just as likely to enjoy school as those in &#8220;unskilled&#8221; occupations. Children with higher cognitive ability were more likely to enjoy school than not, girls were twice as likely to say they enjoyed school than boys, and non-white children were almost twice as likely to report enjoying school than their white counterparts.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a strong relationship between children’s opinion of their teacher and how much they enjoyed school: those whose parents reported that they liked their teachers were more than nine times more likely to enjoy school than those who did not. Similarly, those who had confidence in their work also enjoyed school more.</p>



<p>Enjoyment of school didn’t just have a short-term impact, however. Those who enjoyed school at age six scored on average 14.4 more points at GCSE — a difference of two grades — even when the researchers had controlled for other factors related to educational achievement like cognitive ability and family socioeconomic status. They were also 29% more likely to obtain five or more A*-C grades, including those Maths and English qualifications so crucial for employment. In fact, enjoyment of school aged six was almost as strong a predictor of educational achievement aged 16 as other factors such as sex and socioeconomic status.</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that enjoyment of school has an impact on grades. But it’s striking that enjoyment at age six may impact grades aged 16, particularly when you consider its relative importance alongside factors like gender and cognitive ability.</p>



<p>The results also appear promising for potential interventions. Enjoyment is potentially more modifiable than socioeconomic factors; designing interventions that target school enjoyment and promote positive feelings about school could therefore have a significant impact on attainment many years down the line.</p>



<p>The team notes that the results should not be taken as a definitive way to address inequality in education, an issue which is clearly complex and multi-layered; future research could also explore <em>why</em> children do or do not enjoy school and how this interacts with external, social factors. However, thinking carefully about enjoyment could be one piece in the jigsaw of academic attainment.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Infant_Shakespeare_Attended_by_Nature_and_the_Passions_MET_DP858617-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>What role should literature have in the interdisciplinary study of emotion? The dominant answer today seems to be “not much.” Scholars of literature of course write about emotion but fundamental questions about what emotion is and how it works belong elsewhere: to psychology, cognitive science, neurophysiology, philosophy of mind. In Shakespeare’s time the picture was different. What the period called “passions” were material for ethics and for that part of natural philosophy dealing with the soul; but it was rhetoric that offered the most extensive accounts of the passions. This—to us strange—disciplinary situation had ancient roots: Aristotle’s most expansive discussion of the passions appears in his <em>Rhetoric</em>. Since early modern literary theory was based on rhetoric, this forges a direct relationship between literature and the study of passions.</p><p>What does it mean to think about passion rhetorically? One answer takes us to a famous Hamlet soliloquy:</p><blockquote><p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p><p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p><p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p><p>That from her working all his visage wann’d,</p><p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,</p><p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p><p>With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! (2.2.545–51)</p></blockquote><p>This is about more than effective performance: it encodes an account of the cognitive underpinnings of passion that emphasizes the rhetorical functioning of the mind. The “fiction” Hamlet is thinking of is a mental<em> </em>fiction: a “conceit” or phantasm, which is a fiction in the sense that it is a made thing: a product of our souls. In the sequence traced here, an imagined conceit alters the soul and that alteration in turn alters the body. All passions are fictional in the sense that all are based on “nothing”: that is, on mental images. A second sense of “fiction” is relevant as well: fiction as that kind of made thing that is an invented story. The actor describes Hecuba at the fall of Troy; in doing so, he is both himself moved and moves those who hear him. The transmission of passion is not a secondary issue separate from what passion “is” but follows directly from passion’s relation to imagination: that is, its “fictional” standing. Literature can address the passions because passions are quasi-mimetic: they are ways of seeing and evaluating the objects of our concern.</p><p>The knowledge produced by a rhetoric of the passions is remote from what the early modern period called “<em>scientia</em>”: certain, demonstrative knowledge of universals. Even Aristotle’s chapters on the passions in the <em>Rhetoric</em> do not offer anything like that: they give brief definitions of each passion, but mostly offer ramified lists of the kinds of situations producing each. Early modern writers expanded on such accounts. The second edition of Thomas Wright’s <em>Passions of the Mind</em>—printed 1604, the same year as Q2 <em>Hamlet</em>—spends nearly 20% of its length surveying the “motives to love”: the means to move love in others. The discussion is divided into seventeen topics, from pardoning of injuries to gift-giving; that last is subdivided into fourteen further “circumstances,” addressing the nature of the gift, the giver, and the receiver, and the specifics of <em>how</em> the gift is given. There is nothing finished about either list: one could easily add more motives, more circumstances. And this is the point. Since passions are responses to the situations in which we find ourselves, they vary in as many ways as those situations vary. According to a common early modern phrase, passions are “accidents” of the soul, where “accident” means both a contingent qualitative alteration and an event. We study passions by looking out at the world of events. But the knowledge we can attain in this way is at best probable: as a series of seventeenth-century books argue, passions are caused by their objects; those objects are qualified and circumstanced particulars; they are infinite; and the passions too are infinite. Passions are at the limits of the knowable.</p><p>Rhetoric knows the passions by tracing them to their circumstances. That is, it knows them narratively, and it construes narrative as a means of producing knowledge about passions in their particularity. This way of knowing is evoked in Francis Bacon’s <em>Advancement of Learning</em>: “poets and writers of Histories” have been passion’s “best Doctors”—that is, best scholars—because in them we find depicted “how affections are kindled and incited: and how pacified and refrained: and how again contained from act and further degree: how they disclose themselves, how they work, how they vary, how they gather and fortify, how they are enwrapped one within another, and how they do fight and encounter.”</p><p>Bacon wants a natural history of the passions to displace this unsystematic poetic and historical knowledge. It is tempting to say that this is exactly what happened in the next two centuries, as forms of empirical psychology took over a space that once belonged to rhetoric. But it matters that these psychologies reoccupied rhetoric’s terrain. The knowledge they offer is closer to the one Bacon ascribes to poets and historians than to <em>scientia</em>: in the sphere of the passions, rhetoric is the forerunner of an empirical knowledge of particulars. One can trace its continuing if hidden influence on new psychologies from Locke—who recommended Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em> as part of the study of the passions—to Hume and Smith, whose models of the mind echo the psychology of the vivid image articulated by Hamlet and the circumstantial analysis of passions practiced by Wright. Scholars sometimes claim that a “psychological” approach to Shakespeare is anachronistic, because his period had no psychology. That is not entirely accurate, but the main point is that, in a sense, the period’s literature <em>was</em> its psychology: a circumstantial, open-ended, narrative knowledge of the passions grounded in rhetoric. That knowledge, which thrives beyond the limits of any system, still has something to tell us about how we know the emotions now—not as experts, but as people engaged in everyday life.</p><p><em>Feature image: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/708003">Infant Shakespeare Attended by Nature and the Passions, The Elisha Whittelsey Collection, The Elisha Whittelsey Fund, 1949</a> </em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/657063408/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/657063408/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f07%2fInfant_Shakespeare_Attended_by_Nature_and_the_Passions_MET_DP858617-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/657063408/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/adapting-shakespeare-shattering-stereotypes-of-asian-women-onstage-and-onscreen/">Adapting Shakespeare: shattering stereotypes of Asian women onstage and onscreen</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/have-humans-always-lived-in-a-pluriverse-of-worlds/">Have humans always lived in a &#8220;pluriverse&#8221; of worlds?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/man-791440_640-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>What is food insecurity?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.036">Food insecurity</a> can be defined as “the inability to consume an adequate quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so”. As well as hunger, this definition captures the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf">dimensions</a> of food insecurity (or food poverty) that are sometimes overlooked: stability, agency and sustainability. Can people <em>always</em> access food? Can they do so in a way that’s free of shame and stigma? Will the current food system work for us all in the long-term?</p>
<p><strong>Portrayal of food insecurity in UK newspapers</strong></p>
<p>Food insecurity presents a large and growing problem in the UK. We estimated that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020000087">24% of UK adults</a> were experiencing food insecurity in 2017 – resorting to <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/end-year-stats/">food banks</a> among other coping mechanisms to feed their families. Our study aimed to understand the ways in which newspapers covered the topic of food insecurity – how the problem and drivers were framed. This provides insight on the attitudes towards the problem, the potential solutions and their acceptability among different stakeholders.</p>
<p>The picture our work painted was a nuanced one, where many societal, political and economic factors were portrayed as contributing to the growing problem of food insecurity. At the heart of it, people did not have enough money to meet their needs. The reasons often cited for this were: low wages, insecure jobs, unemployment and high cost of living.</p>
<p>But further upstream, we saw more contention. Charities and advocacy groups highlighted the structural barriers to people meeting their living costs – austerity, funding cuts, policies that exacerbate social inequalities. The roll-out of the Universal Credit social security system (introduced to replace several means-tested benefits) was also considered a major contributor to the problem, especially the long <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/five-weeks-too-long/">wait</a> (of at least 5 weeks) when switching from the old system to Universal Credit.</p>
<img class="alignright wp-image-12457 size-large" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-1024x587.png" alt="" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-1024x587.png 1024w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-300x172.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-768x441.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-640x367.png 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog.png 1379w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />
<p>The voices of charities, advocacy groups and the general public appeared united within the news articles – people were urging the government to take action. The government, however, was portrayed as reluctant to admit links between welfare policies and increasing food insecurity, with government representatives calling food insecurity a ‘cash flow’ issue and promoting charity to help those experiencing food insecurity.</p>
<p>Our work highlights a disconnect between the problem and the solutions. The problem was presented as systemic, whilst the solutions were heavily reliant on charity – solutions that, at best, provide short-term relief for families experiencing hunger, unhealthy diets and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1332/175982716X14721954314922">social consequences</a> of food insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Holiday hunger </strong></p>
<p>The issue of ‘holiday hunger’ (hunger experienced by children during the school holidays, often because they are no longer receiving free school meals) has brought more attention onto the problem. This has resulted in some political action, e.g. the <a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Childrens-Future-Food-Inquiry-report.pdf">Children’s Future Food Inquiry</a> and the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/408/food-poverty-health-and-environment-committee/">House of Lord’s Select Committee Inquiry on Food, Poverty, Health, and Environment</a>.</p>
<p>A debate surrounding food vouchers for children who usually receive free school meals at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was played out in the media. <a href="https://endchildfoodpoverty.org/">Campaigners</a> pressured the government to provide food vouchers to low-income families throughout the summer. Their success in reversing the government’s decision to not provide support during the summer holidays shows news media to be a powerful tool for advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity in post-pandemic UK </strong></p>
<p>As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the economic factors contributing to food insecurity will have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/03/the-uks-covid-19-unemployment-crisis-in-six-charts">worsened</a>. Urgent action must be taken to protect families from food insecurity, with a focus on solutions that address the upstream drivers rather than relying on food banks and other forms of charitable food aid.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/656934932/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-s-migaj-747964-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>When we open our eyes in the morning, we take for granted that we will consciously see the world in all of its dazzling variety. Likewise, when we consciously hear conversations with family and friends, consciously have feelings about them, and consciously know who they are.</p><p>The immediacy of our conscious experiences does not, however, explain <em>how </em>we consciously see, hear, feel, and know; <em>where</em> in our brains this happens; or, perhaps more importantly, <em>why </em>evolution was driven to invent conscious states of mind. I will summarize some of the reasons here, starting with why we consciously see. My answer will propose, in brief, that <em>we consciously see in order to be able to reach. </em></p><p>Being able to make an arm movement that reaches a nearby object cannot be taken for granted, if only because of the way our eyes process light from the world. Seeing begins when light passes into our eyes through a lens and hits our photosensitive retinas, much as occurs in a camera. However, our retinas are not manmade. They are made from living cells that need to be nourished at a very fast rate. In addition, the light-sensitive photoreceptors that comprise a retina send their signals to a brain using an optic nerve. These two factors force our retinas to pick up visual signals from the world in a very noisy and incomplete way, as the first two images illustrate.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146470"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Figure-1.jpg" width="650" height="730" /><figcaption>Figure one (top); figure two (bottom)</figcaption></figure><p>Figure one shows a cross-section through the eye, showing the lens on the left and the retina on the right. The photodetectors send their light-activated signals down pathways, called axons. All the axons are collected together to form the optic nerve, which sends all the signals to the brain.</p><p>Figure two shows that the part of the retina behind which the optic nerve forms is called the <em>blind spot</em> because there are no photodetectors there. Note that the blind spot is about as large as the <em>fovea</em>. The fovea is where the retina can form images with high acuity. Our eyes move incessantly through the day to point our foveas to look directly at objects that interest us.</p><p>In addition, retinal veins that nourish retinal cells lie between the lens and the retina, and thereby prevent light from reaching retinal positions behind them.</p><p>We can now begin to understand what it means to claim that conscious seeing is for reaching. This is true because, as illustrated in figure three, visual images are occluded by the blind spot and retinal veins. Even a simple blue line that is registered on the retina is sufficient to illustrate why this is a problem. Suppose that, as in the figure, the blue line passes through positions of the blind spot. Because the blue line is not registered at those positions, without further processing we could not reach for the blue line at any of these positions. The brain reconstructs the missing segments of the blue line at higher processing stages so that we can, in fact, reach all positions along the line. The same problem occurs no matter what object is occluded by the blind spot or the retinal veins.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146471"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Figure-2.jpg" width="450" height="382" /><figcaption>Figure three</figcaption></figure><p>This is not a minor problem because, as I already noted, the blind spot is as big as the fovea.</p><p>But what does this have to do with consciousness?!</p><p>As I will indicate below, it takes multiple processing stages for our brains to complete representations of images that are occluded by the blind spot and retinal veins. But then how do our brains know <em>which</em> of these processing stages generates a complete enough representation with which to control reliable reaches? Choosing an incomplete representation with which to control actions could have disastrous consequences.</p><p>The answer lies in the claim that “all conscious states are resonant states.” I will explain what a resonance is in a moment. For now, the main point is that, a resonance between a complete surface representation of an object and the next processing stage renders that surface representation conscious. Once such a complete surface representation is highlighted by consciousness, it can control actions. And because it is complete, this representation can successfully control accurate reaches to any position on an attended object that is sufficiently near.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146472"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Figure-3.jpg" width="450" height="275" /><figcaption>Figure four</figcaption></figure><p>The selection of complete surface representations occurs in prestriate visual cortical area V4, which resonates with the posterior parietal cortex, or PPC, to generate a <em>surface-shroud resonance</em>. As illustrated in figure four, <em>spatial attention</em> from the PPC can highlight particular positions of the V4 surface representation via a top-down interaction, at the same time that <em>spatial intention</em> can activate movement commands upstream to look at and reach for a desired goal object.</p><p>A resonance is a dynamical state during which neuronal firings across a brain network are amplified and synchronized when they interact via reciprocal excitatory feedback signals during a matching process that occurs between bottom-up and top-down pathways, like the pathways between V4 and PPC. Resonant states focus attention on patterns of critical features that control predictive success, while suppressing irrelevant features. They also trigger learning of critical features—hence the name <em>adaptive resonance</em>—and buffer learned memories against catastrophic (sudden and unpredictable) forgetting.</p><p>The conscious states that adaptive resonances support are part of larger adaptive behavioral capabilities that help us to adapt to a changing world. Accordingly, resonances for conscious seeing help to ensure effective looking and reaching; for conscious hearing help to ensure effective auditory communication, including speaking; and for conscious feeling help to ensure effective goal-oriented action.</p><p>Figure five summarizes six types of resonances and the functions that they carry out in different brain regions.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146473"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Figure-4.jpg" width="450" height="355" /><figcaption>Figure five</figcaption></figure><p>Surface-shroud resonances derive their name from the fact that surface representations resonate with spatial attention that covers the shape of the attended object, a so-called attentional shroud. Surface-shroud resonances support conscious seeing of the object, whereas feature-category resonances support conscious recognition of them. When both kinds of resonances synchronize, we can consciously see <em>and</em> know about familiar objects.</p><p>What processes are needed to form a complete surface representation from the noisy retinal images that are occluded by the blind spot and retinal veins? First, the blind spot and retinal veins themselves are removed from this representation. This happens because they are attached to the retina, which continually jiggles in its orbit, thereby creating persistent transient signals on the photoreceptors from objects in the world. Retinally stabilized images like the blind spot and retinal veins fade because they do not cause such transients. Next, our brains compensate for changes in illumination that occur through the day and that could undermine the processing of object shapes. Finally, our brains need even more stages to complete the boundaries and fill-in the surface brightnesses and colors that are occluded by the blind spot and retinal veins, as illustrated by figure six. Conscious states enable our brains to select the complete boundaries and surfaces that result from all of these processes.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146474"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Figure-5.jpg" width="450" height="335" /><figcaption>Figure six</figcaption></figure><p><em>Feature image: S Migaj via Pexels</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/656934932/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/656934932/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f07%2fpexels-s-migaj-747964-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/656934932/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/beyond-history-and-identity-what-else-can-we-learn-from-the-past/">Beyond history and identity: what else can we learn from the past?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/the-vsi-podcast-season-two-homer-film-music-consciousness-samurai-and-more/">The VSI podcast season two: Homer, film music, consciousness, samurai, and more</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>A striking paper in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2018 <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/24/the-liking-gap-we-tend-to-underestimate-the-positive-first-impression-we-make-on-strangers/">revealed consistent evidence for the &#8220;liking gap&#8221; — that other people like us more than we think</a>. Now, for the first time, researchers have looked at how this phenomenon arises during childhood. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980754">The study</a>, led by Wouter Wolf at Duke University, US, on children aged 4 to 11, found that the liking gap emerged by around 5, and then grew wider with age. The findings have theoretical but also practical implications: parents and teachers can reassure kids that their judgements about what their peers think of them are likely to be overly negative, which could be of particular help to those who are worried about their relationships with classmates.</p>



<span id="more-42829"></span>



<p>Wolf and his colleagues recruited pairs of children who didn’t know each other from a local museum and other events. They first spent five minutes building a tower together. Then each child used a seven-item emoticon scale, which ranged from a crying face to a beaming face, to rate their feelings about the other child (how much they liked the other boy or girl, wanted to play with them again, and wanted them to be their friend) and to indicate what ratings they thought their partner would give them. The difference between a child’s perceptions of their partner’s ratings of them and their partner’s actual ratings gave a &#8220;liking gap&#8221; score for each participant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data on a total of 261 children were included in the analysis. The gender make-up of the pairs made no difference to the results. However, age did: a liking gap appeared by around the age of five, and was more extreme as age increased.</p>



<p>The causes for the gap among the youngest and older children were different, though. When the gap first emerged, it was driven by more positive partner evaluations — five-year-olds liked other kids more than four-year-olds did. The team thinks this reflects greater exposure to children (kindergarten enrolment is mandatory at five in the area of the US where the study was conducted), which could reduce anxiety about strangers and make social interactions more enjoyable.</p>



<p>The expansion of the liking gap after age five was driven by something different, however: as they grew older, the kids had increasingly <em>less</em> positive perceptions of their partner’s feelings about them. “This suggests that after the emergence of the liking gap between ages four and five, its subsequent development is primarily driven by increased social concern with other people’s evaluations of the self,” the team writes.</p>



<p>This would fit with other work finding that children develop a more complex theory of mind around age six, when they also start to become more concerned about the impression they are making on others. They may start to realise, for example, that another child might be being friendly because they want to come across as friendly and likeable, rather than because that other child is genuinely enjoying their company. As the gap widened with age, this suggests that, up to 11, at least, children become less certain about what another child’s behaviour really signals.</p>



<p>Individual differences might influence the scale of an individual’s liking gap. “It is not implausible that, in some cases, shyness, social anxiety or insecure attachment could be a manifestation or a consequence of a relatively high discrepancy between how much children like other people and how much they think other people generally like them back,” the team notes.</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed to explore this. But perhaps simply explaining the existence of the liking gap to kids might be one way to improve how children feel about their interactions with their peers, especially with strangers — when joining a new school, say. That’s a study I’d really like to see.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Na Helian will talk about her work done together with her PhD student Stiphen Chowdhury about &quot;Feature Weighted Density-based Clustering&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>DBSCAN is arguably the most popular density-based clustering algorithm, and it
is capable of recovering non-spherical clusters. One of its main weaknesses is
that it treats all features equally. In this paper, we propose a density-based
clustering algorithm capable of calculating feature weights representing the
degree of relevance of each feature, which takes the density structure of the
data into account. First, we improve DBSCAN and introduce a new algorithm
called DBSCANR. DBSCANR reduces the number of parameters of DBSCAN to one. Then,
a new step is introduced to the clustering process of DBSCANR to iteratively
update feature weights based on the current partition of data. The feature
weights produced by the weighted version of the new clustering algorithm,
W-DBSCANR, measure the relevance of variables in a clustering and can be used
in feature selection in data mining applications where large and complex
real-world data are often involved. Experimental results on both artificial and
real-world data have shown that the new algorithms outperformed the DBSCAN type
algorithms in recovering clusters in data.</p>

<html><body><p>A research article is an orderly summation of a complex and circuitous process. It is characterized by detailed planning, iterative trial and error, meticulous execution and thoughtful analysis. As a summary, articles are invaluable, but detailed insight into processes and procedures is required to truly understand and reproduce research. Detailed public methodological documentation can contextualize results, subvert bias, enhance reproducibility, and increase efficiency across the entire scientific ecosystem. In recent years, the research community has gained a deeper appreciation for the value of detailed methodological documentation. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-research">Methods <em>are </em>research</h2>



<p>Developing a methodology and then executing it is arguably the largest component of research. It&rsquo;s the day-to-day business of science, the mechanism for capturing data that can later be used to investigate a research question. Depending on the field and approach, methods can take many forms, from a recipe-like protocol, to a script, to a database of behavioral stimuli. But whatever the specifics, a clear and complete method is key to running a consistent and reliable study, reproducing the work in future, and understanding the results as a reader.</p>



<p>Just as with research articles, restricted access to methods creates inefficiencies and slows progress. Researchers expend time (and funding) developing similar approaches, repeating experiments and pursuing dead ends, unaware of related work. Out-dated procedures remain in use long after they&rsquo;ve been superseded because practitioners cannot access the latest advances. And there is an opportunity cost. Researchers rely on other research for inspiration, direction and advancement. When the products of research remain hidden, promising new leads may be left unexplored.</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-lasting">Methods are lasting</h2>



<p>Methods are highly transferable. More than any other research artifact, methods have the potential for adaptation or reuse in different contexts and across a broad range of research questions and disciplines. For evidence, look no further than researchers&rsquo; frequently expressed frustration with &ldquo;citation trails&rdquo; in which an article methods section cites the methods section of an earlier work, and that work cites another work, and so on, often going back years, or even decades. Similarly, stand-alone methods articles are often <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157718300440?via%3Dihub">among the most highly-cited</a> publications, and they continue to receive citations over a longer period of time than standard research articles.</p>



<h2 id="results-are-subjective">Results are subjective&mdash;methods less so</h2>



<p>In order to generate conclusions, researchers make choices about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0462-9">how to analyze data</a> and interpret the patterns they observe. These analytical and interpretive choices are valuable, but subjective. They benefit from the researchers&rsquo; intuition, inspiration and expertise&mdash;but those same factors can also introduce bias and lead to misinterpretation. The unencumbered, unprocessed artifacts of research&mdash;such as methods and raw data&mdash;are much less likely to be influenced either positively or negatively by personal interests, insights or opinions. They are closer to neutral&mdash;a clear accounting, rather than an argument with a personal perspective.</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-insufficiently-described">Methods are insufficiently described</h2>



<p>A research article is not an instruction manual. Often, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/plan-replicate-50-high-impact-cancer-papers-shrinks-just-18">published research cannot be reproduced</a>, not because the original work was flawed, but simply because the article format is not conducive to a really in-depth description of the process.</p>

<h2 id="methods-serve-authors">Methods serve authors, readers and the research community</h2>



<p>Clear, complete, and open methods increase credibility and support lasting impact. Documenting and sharing methodologies has interrelated scientific and reputational benefits for individuals and the community.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Making methods public creates a positive impression. Having the option to review detailed methods increases readers&rsquo; trust, whether or not they consult the documentation.&nbsp;</li><li>Researchers can more easily reproduce results with detailed open methods. Authors who want to apply the method in their own research can do so more efficiently if the approach is described in detail and easy to find online.</li><li>Strong, easy-to-follow methods are more likely to be used in future research, and by extension more likely to be cited, bringing fresh eyes to the original and helping it to remain relevant over time.</li></ul>



<p>Under the best circumstances, these three factors can feed off one another in an expanding cycle of trust, reuse, and readership.</p>



<h2 id="future-of-methods">The future of methods as permanent assets</h2>



<p>This combination of relevance, usefulness, potential for reuse, and demand suggests that methods deserve a more formalized, permanent place in the scientific record. Methods should be reviewed and validated, indexed and archived, searched for and cited. They should be treated as stand-alone research artifacts, rather than supplementary material of interest only within the context of a research article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside their enormous potential to positively impact the research community, sharing methods has a comparatively low barrier to entry for authors. From a practical perspective, process documentation often already exists in some form (for example, in instructions for internal use, or as part of a funding application), providing a convenient basis for a publication. More importantly, detailed, published methods are a natural extension of existing practice. Some discussion of methods has always been standard in the sciences. Increasing depth and detail, establishing norms, implementing peer review, and formalizing publication are all important and logically consistent extensions, analogous to the evolution of scientific discourse from published correspondence in the 18th century into the modern peer-reviewed research article. It will take time, community discussion and experimentation to refine and establish new norms for communicating methods&mdash;but the notion of communicating methods at all does not inspire the same heated debate as other aspects of Open Science practice.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How can we communicate methods more effectively?</h2>



<p>The scholarly community is developing new ways to document, preserve and communicate methods for future use. In a future post, we&rsquo;ll explore some of them.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conspiracy theories have surged over the last few years, as we’ve <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=conspiracy+theories">frequently reported</a>. One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/23/study-shows-60-of-britons-believe-in-conspiracy-theories">2018 study</a>, for example, found that 60% of British people believed in a conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the rise of QAnon in America has been particularly alarming.</p>



<p>It’s easy to dismiss conspiracy theorists — but this is not a productive way to tackle the issue. Instead, researchers are exploring <em>why</em> people get sucked into such belief systems, even at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/">expense of personal relationships</a>. This work can help us understand why conspiracies spread, and provide some useful guidance for talking to loved ones who may have fallen for a conspiracy theory.</p>



<span id="more-42812"></span>



<p><strong>Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?</strong></p>



<p>There are a number of reasons someone may be attracted to a conspiracy theory, often related to frustrated psychological needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The first of these needs are <em>epistemic</em>, related to the need to know the truth and have clarity and certainty” explains Karen M. Douglas, Professor of Social Psychology at the University of Kent. “The other needs are <em>existential</em>, which are related to the need to feel safe and to have some control over things that are happening around us, and <em>social</em>, which are related to the need to maintain our self-esteem and feel positive about the groups that we belong to.”</p>



<p>So, for instance, if someone is anxious about the pandemic and feels out of control, they may be drawn to theories that suggest it is false, satisfying their existential needs. If they are frustrated about a particularly political situation, they may start exploring apparently clear-cut solutions to unanswerable questions, satisfying their epistemic needs.</p>



<p>There are also numerous risk factors related to conspiratorial thinking: conspiracy theories can be fuelled by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">a desire to feel special</a> or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/abs/are-conspiracy-theories-harmless/FA0A9D612CC82B02F91AAC2439B4A2FB">political apathy</a>, for example. People with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">lower levels of critical thinking</a> are also more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, as Stephan Lewandowsky, co-author of a recent <a href="https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ConspiracyTheoryHandbook.pdf">Conspiracy Theory Handbook</a> and Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol, explains.</p>



<p>Those who endorse conspiracy theories are “usually people who believe that intuition is a better way to know the truth than data — people who think their gut feeling is telling them what to believe and who don’t need or want evidence to make a decision,” he says. “They don’t have a healthy level of scepticism.”</p>



<p>Conspiracy theories, by their nature, are also &#8220;self-sealing&#8221;, meaning that evidence can’t be used to refute them — one of the reasons they are so hard to counter. “The absence of any evidence is taken to be evidence <em>for </em>the theory”,  Lewandowsky explains. “To give you one example, there was someone claiming on YouTube last year that Anthony Fauci was personally directing money into a lab in Wuhan. When the interviewer said there was no evidence, her reply was ‘see, that’s how good the cover-up is. There’s no evidence because they cover it up so well’.”</p>



<p><strong>How to talk to somebody who believes in conspiracy theories</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would prevent conspiracy theories from taking root in the first place. As Douglas and her colleague Daniel Jolley note in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12453">study</a> on the anti-vaccination movement, &#8220;inoculation&#8221; can prevent the influence of conspiracy theories to begin with.</p>



<p>They found that anti-conspiracy arguments increased intention to vaccinate a child when presented <em>before</em> conspiracy theories. But once these conspiracies were established, they were much more difficult to correct, even with arguments that were factual and seemed logical.</p>



<p>So talking to somebody before they become immersed in the world of conspiracy theories could be a way of preventing it altogether — something Lewandowsky and other authors <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799">refer to as &#8220;prebunking&#8221;</a>. As <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/summer-2020/vaccinating-against-viruses-mind">David Robson wrote</a> for <em>The Psychologist</em> last year, this isn’t just a case of presenting new information — rather, it’s about encouraging people to think critically, arming them with techniques to protect against misinformation. (The <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/december-2020/game-vs-fake-news">&#8220;Bad News&#8221; game</a>, developed by University of Cambridge researchers, is one example of an intervention oriented around critical thinking.)</p>



<p>Dispelling a conspiracy theory once it’s entrenched, however, is not an easy task. “When people believe something so strongly, it’s difficult to change their minds,” Douglas says. “People are very good at selecting and interpreting information that seems to confirm what they already believe, and to reject or misinterpret information that goes against those beliefs.”</p>



<p>But <a href="https://theconversation.com/ive-been-talking-to-conspiracy-theorists-for-20-years-here-are-my-six-rules-of-engagement-143132">as academic Jovan Byford writes in <em>The Conversation</em></a>, “underpinning conspiracy theories are feelings of resentment, indignation and disenchantment about the world”. So it’s important to understand the emotions that might be behind someone’s false beliefs, and to try and empathise with them.</p>



<p>One study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886921000799">published in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em></a> earlier this year found that those espousing COVID-19 conspiracy theories were more likely to experience anxiety, while <a href="https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/10151">another</a> found that many conspiracy theorists also felt that they had little control over their lives or the political situations they found themselves in.</p>



<p>Douglas points out that people believing in conspiracies may feel “confused, worried and alienated”. It would be counterproductive, therefore, to behave in a hostile or ridiculing way towards them. “This just dismisses their views and might alienate them even further and push them further towards conspiracy theories,” she says. “It’s important to keep calm and listen.” “The whole thing is about empathy,” agrees Lewandowsky. “Ridiculing people doesn’t help — and there is evidence to suggest that you shouldn’t do that.”</p>



<p>As anyone who has had a strained family conversation about politics will attest, it can be hard not to respond in a combative manner if you fundamentally disagree with the way somebody sees the world. But <a href="https://www.mikeyeomans.info/papers/receptiveness.pdf">research from Harvard Business School</a>, published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, suggests that being receptive might be the way forward instead.</p>



<p>The team, led by Mike Yeomans, argues that “conversational receptiveness” is key to de-escalating conflict: if you talk to someone in a way that indicates you’re receptive to <em>their </em>views and beliefs, they’re more likely to be persuaded by yours.</p>



<p>Simple phrases like “I understand that&#8230;” or “What you’re saying is&#8230;” could therefore bridge the gap between you and somebody with entirely different views — and even if this doesn’t mean they disavow a conspiracist belief, it could help a relationship remain friendly and non-antagonistic.</p>



<p><strong>Power and purpose</strong></p>



<p>As Lewandowsky points out, empowering people may also help to combat conspiratorial thinking. As we’ve seen, belief in conspiracy theories is closely linked to feelings of powerlessness — so it follows that instilling a sense of control could help ward off conspiracism.</p>



<p>On a personal level, people can be empowered through interventions that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25217762/">encourage analytic thinking</a> and that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3161">remind them of times they were in control.</a> In one study, for example, participants who were asked to recall a situation in which they were in control were less likely to believe in a conspiracy theory than those asked to recall a situation in which they were out of control. Such approaches may help you get through to someone you care about.</p>



<p>“One thing that can be done is to restore people’s sense of control,” Lewandowsky says. “One of the reasons people become conspiracy theorists is because they feel they’ve lost control of their lives and they’re afraid — that&#8217;s one of the reasons why a pandemic will trigger more of this thinking, because people have lost control of their lives.”</p>



<p>“So that’s one indirect way of getting at it — don’t try to talk someone out of it, but make them feel good about being in charge of their lives. Then they may gradually give up, because they don’t need it anymore.”</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that it will always be possible to disabuse someone of their beliefs. “The hardcore believers who are really down the rabbit hole&#8230; they are extremely difficult to reach,” Lewandowsky says. It’s also important to protect your own wellbeing when having conversations that may be frustrating or upsetting. But treating people who believe in conspiracy theories with empathy and calmness may be the first step towards a productive conversation.</p>

                <p>New paper in Nature Neuroscience: Cerebellar granule cell axons support high-dimensional representations (Frederic Lanore, N. Alex Cayco-Gajic, Harsha Gurnani, Diccon Coyle &amp; R. Angus Silver)</p>
<blockquote><p>In classical theories of cerebellar cortex, high-dimensional sensorimotor representations are used to separate neuronal activity patterns, improving associative learning and motor performance. Recent experimental studies suggest that cerebellar granule cell (GrC) population activity is low-dimensional. To examine sensorimotor representations from the point of view of downstream Purkinje cell ‘decoders’, we used three-dimensional acousto-optic lens two-photon microscopy to record from hundreds of GrC axons. Here we show that GrC axon population activity is high dimensional and distributed with little fine-scale spatial structure during spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, distinct behavioral states are represented along orthogonal dimensions in neuronal activity space. These results suggest that the cerebellar cortex supports high-dimensional representations and segregates behavioral state-dependent computations into orthogonal subspaces, as reported in the neocortex. Our findings match the predictions of cerebellar pattern separation theories and suggest that the cerebellum and neocortex use population codes with common features, despite their vastly different circuit structures.</p></blockquote>

<p>Imagine that you’re with your partner at a party and you both get chatting to a stranger. Your partner and the stranger get on really well. Before long, they’re laughing away and ignoring you. Which would hurt most: rejection by the stranger, or by your partner?</p>



<p>The answer, according to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-53161-002.html">new research</a> in <em>Social Psychology</em> is that — in the moment, at least — they would hurt the same. It seems that we have such a deep need for affiliation that any form of ostracism triggers similar levels of immediate pain.</p>

<p>Anne Böckler at Leibniz University in Germany and colleagues asked participants to come to the lab with either a friend of the same sex or a romantic partner (of the opposite sex, in this case). While in a separate room from their friend/partner, they played a screen-based ball-tossing game with what they thought was their friend/partner and a third online player. In fact, the passes from this other &#8220;player&#8221; as well as the passes that the participant believed their friend/partner to be making were controlled by the researchers.</p>



<p>Photographs of the participant, their friend/partner and the third player (who was of the same gender as the friend/partner) were displayed on the screen next to individual icons. By clicking different buttons on the keyboard, the participant could choose who to pass the ball to. But how many times they were themselves passed the ball depended on their experimental condition. &#8220;Included&#8221; participants received 20 of the overall 60 passes (as would happen if the ball tosses were equally shared). Those who were &#8220;excluded by their friend/partner&#8221; received 10 passes overall, all from the stranger. Those who were &#8220;excluded by the stranger&#8221; also received a total of 10 passes, but all from their friend/partner. People in the fourth group were more completely excluded: after receiving two passes at the beginning of the game, they were then ignored.</p>



<p>Immediately after the game, participants completed questionnaires about their mood during and after playing. These revealed that exclusion dampened people’s mood during (though not after) the game, whether they had been excluded by a partner, friend or stranger. Total exclusion had a bigger effect on mood.</p>



<p>Fully-included participants also scored higher than all the others on measures of &#8220;belongingness&#8221;, self-esteem, meaningful existence (having a central reason for being), and overall basic need satisfaction. Those who had been fully excluded showed even lower basic need satisfaction than the other groups, though full exclusion did not worsen effects on self-esteem. “Crucially, when comparing exclusions by close other with exclusion by a stranger we found no significant differences for any individual or overall basic needs,” the researchers note. Scores for relationship satisfaction were also lower when the participants were excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner, and lowest among those who were totally excluded. So, while the degree of ostracism clearly mattered, being excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner had the same impacts.</p>



<p>This is a small study, however. And it focused on impacts during and immediately after the game. Rejection by a romantic partner or close friend would surely have longer-lasting effects — even if indirectly, by altering perceptions of the quality of the relationship itself. (I should note that the participants were all debriefed afterwards.) A bigger study might also find impacts on the participants’ behaviour. In this work, exclusion didn’t affect who the participants chose to pass the ball to — there was no evidence that excluded participants tried either to &#8220;tend and befriend&#8221; their rejector, or stopped passing them the ball.</p>



<p>Though this new study is one of the first to simultaneously compare the effects of ostracism by friends/partners vs strangers, earlier studies have found that even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103103001823">ostracism by a computer</a>, or someone belonging to a detested group, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-18930-006">such as the Ku Klux Klan</a>, has negative effects.</p>



<p>All of these findings speak to the fundamental nature of the effects of ostracism on our wellbeing. Our ancestors’ lives depended on their having strong social networks — and the drive to have and preserve one, is, it seems, still with us.</p>

<p>If you live in a country with more UVB sunlight, you might have an advantage when it comes to risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunlight is used by your skin to make vitamin D, which is anti-carcinogenic. For those of us farther from the equator, we only get a little bit of UVB, usually in the middle of the day (around 10am-2pm, depending on where you live) and during summer months. By comparison, people living in countries closer to the equator are bathed in UVB year-round for most of the day.</p>

<p><strong><u>How Does Vitamin D Prevent Cancer?</u></strong></p>
<p>Vitamin D has tons of effects on cells. In cancer research, vitamin D is DINAMIT! This acronym describes the sequence of events at the cellular level when vitamin D is low. DINOMIT spells <em>disjunction, initiation, natural selection, overgrowth, metastasis, involution, </em>and<em> transition</em> (see accompanying illustration from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279709001057">Annals of Epidemiology</a>). With good vitamin D levels, cells can communicate better with their neighboring cells due to higher production of cadherin molecules. With low vitamin D levels, cells don’t know that they are surrounded by other cells, so they divide uncontrollably, causing cancer.</p>
<p><strong><u>You Might Not Notice Until You’re Older</u></strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_12423" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12423" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 286px"><img class="wp-image-12423 size-full" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/blog.png" alt="" width="276" height="739" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/blog.png 276w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/blog-112x300.png 112w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12423" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Garland CF et al. (2009). Vitamin D for Cancer Prevention: Global Perspective. Annals of Epidemiology 19(7):468-483.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Our research published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> suggests that the anti-cancer effect of vitamin D is hard to notice in people under age 45. In this study, we analyzed the global differences in colorectal cancer, one of the most common forms of cancer. We found that younger people in low-UVB countries had nearly the same rates of cancer as younger people in high-UVB countries. However, when looking at people older than 45, those in low-UVB countries had <em>dramatically</em> higher rates of cancer than those in high-UVB countries.</p>
<p>Does this mean that you don’t need vitamin D until you’re older? Not quite. The cancer-causing effects of low vitamin D take a long time to develop. (In fact, this is a key reason that researchers didn’t see high rates of cancer in low-UVB countries until they looked at older age groups.) Young or old, vitamin D could help you prevent cancer.</p>
<p><strong><u>What Should I Do If I Don’t Live Near The Equator?</u></strong></p>
<p>If you don’t live near the equator, you may need to take additional steps to ensure you have good vitamin D levels. This can include eating high vitamin D foods (such as fatty fish and dairy) or taking a vitamin D supplement. You can also get a few extra rays of mid-day sunshine, as long as you don’t get sunburned.</p>
<p>If you do live near the equator, you probably don’t need to worry quite as much. However, if you work indoors and rarely go outside, you may want to consider alternate ways to get your vitamin D.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you live, you can ask your doctor to measure your vitamin D levels, or you can order an at-home vitamin D test. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152441">Previous research</a> suggests that 40 ng/mL is a good minimum target for cancer prevention.</p>

A deeper understanding of interactions among living things and their environment is also required to manage ecosystem services and prevent the spread of harmful pathogens worldwide. Fueled by recent technological advances, DNA and RNA from environmental samples (eDNA/eRNA) are increasingly being used to help meet this need for knowledge. The application of eDNA/eRNA methods helps us evaluate community composition and answer various questions regarding biotic interactions within and between ecosystems.

But I wanted to be fair and see what the authors did, since their results reflect an enormous amount of work.<br /></p><p><span style="color: red;"><b>Here I will argue that a 10 minute brain scan cannot predict who you will choose at a speed dating event.</b></span> The resultant measures are even further away from identifying a compatible mate for you, since <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.768" target="_blank">only 5% of speed dating interactions result in a relationship</a> of any sort (6% for sexual relationships and 4% for romantic relationships, according to one study).</p><p>I was flabbergasted that anyone would think a “resting” state MRI scan (looking at “<span style="font-size: medium;">+</span>” for 10 min) and its resulting pattern of correlated <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygen-level_dependent" title="Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent">BOLD</a> signal fluctuations would reflect a level of superficial desirability that can be detected by a potential mate at greater than chance level. Another disclosure: this is far from my field of expertise. So I searched the literature. Apparently, “patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship” (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33149.short" target="_blank">Hyon et al., 2020</a>). However, that study was conducted in a small town in South Korea (total population 860), allowing a detailed social network analysis. Plus, people knew each other well and experienced many of the same day to day events, which could shape their functional connectomes. Not exactly relevant for predicting strangers' speed dating choices, eh?</p><p>Another paper identified a “global personality network” based on data from 984 participants in the Human Connectome Project (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320342" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2019</a>). The sample was large enough to support a training set of n=801 and a “hold-out” dataset (n=183) for validation purposes. The results supported the authors' “similar brain, similar personality” hypothesis. But in the dating world, how much do “similars” attract (compared to the popular saying, “opposites attract”)? Well why not construct (dis)similarity profiles between potential pairs by taking the absolute value of differences in functional connectivity (FC), and combine those with values of similarities in FC? Does that make sense?? And in order to arrive at this metric, there's a whole lot of machine learning (but with much smaller training sets)...<br /><br /><b>Identity Classification</b>&nbsp;</p><p>A separate sample of 44 individuals from the Human Connectome Project was used to construct the Similarity of Connectivity Pattern between pairs<span><span>&nbsp;(<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412" target="_blank">Kajimura et al., 2021</a>). These 44 participants had each been scanned twice, allowing 44 self-self pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jessica at time 2), which were compared to 44 self-other pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jennifer at time 2). Self-self “feature values”&nbsp;always show a positive correlation, and these were used to define “individual-specific information.”<br /><br /><b>26,680 feature values?</b>  </span></span></p><p><span><span>To start, 116 regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by Automated Anatomical Labeling (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771995/" target="_blank">AAL</a>). Pairwise comparisons of these for Self scan #1 vs. Self scan #2 (or vs. Other scan #2) resulted in a vector of 6,670 functional connectivities for each data point [(116 × 115)/2]. Then multiply this by four (!!) and you get 26,680 values fed into a machine learning classifier. Why four? Because the slow fluctuating BOLD signals were decomposed into four frequency bands for the classification procedure. Was this necessary? Does it add robustness, or merely more opportunities for false positive results?</span></span></p><p></p><p><span><span><br /></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span><span><span><span><img border="0" data-original-height="700" data-original-width="1946" height="144" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WAyb61BcXA/YNrJumqza0I/AAAAAAAANWM/82YKNqdApJE8g5xlqHwP6FNw4VafTKiWgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h144/Fig%2B3%2B-%2Btop%2B100%2Bfeature%2Bvalues.jpg" width="400" /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Fig. 3 (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412" target="_blank">Kajimura et al., 2021</a>)</b>.

Why these numbers were not perfectly matched, I do not know. The resting state fMRI scan was several days before the first speed dating session. [I'm assuming it was the first, because the Methods say there were three speed dating events. There was also a post-dating scan, which was described in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336154/" target="_blank">another paper</a>]. The three hour event was held in a large room where pairs of participants had 3 min long conversations with every member of the opposite sex. After each conversation, all the men moved to the next table. When all the speed dates were over, each person was asked to identify at least half of the opposite sex individuals they'd like to chat with again.<br /></p></span></span></span>Well, there's a problem here — a requirement to select half the dates could result in less-than-optimal choices in some individuals. This requirement was necessary for sampling purposes, but it makes you wonder about the quality of the matches. Also, there was a strong possibility of unilateral matches — one individual thinks they've found their dream partner but that feeling was not reciprocated. When both members of a pair said "yes" they were considered compatible. Out of a total of 440 possible pairs, 158 were compatible and 282 incompatible.<br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p>The Compatible vs. Incompatible comparisons are the key findings of the study (Fig. 5, with A and B panels as above). Unlike the Identity comparison, compatible male-female pairs did not show more similar functional connnectivity patterns than incompatible pairs (Fig. 5A). <br /><br />Well then...</p><p>“This indicates that the compatibility of female–male relationships is not necessarily represented by the similarity of functional connectivity patterns.”<br /><br />Yes. <br /><br />“Unlike identity classification, compatibility classification was supported by the considerable negative coefficients of the features” (shown in Fig. 6 of the paper).

Thus, I disagree with the claim that...<br /><blockquote><span><span>“</span></span>...the current results indicate that resting-state functional connectivity has information about behavioral tendencies that two individuals actually exhibit during a dyadic interaction, which cannot be measured by self-report methods and thus may remain hidden unless we use neuroimaging methods concurrently.<span><span>”</span></span></blockquote><br />To review the potential limitations of the study, we can't assess the quality of matches (meh vs. enthusiastic), we don't know what the participants were thinking about during their rsfMRI scan (see <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/node/656115.full" target="_blank">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</a>), and we don't know their mental state during the scan. Although rs-FC fMRI is often considered a stable trait”, state factors and motion artifacts can affect the results on a given day (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604231/" target="_blank">Geerligs et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, ~35% of the time, the present paper was unsuccessful in classifying the same person run on two different days (and that's excluding one of four frequencies that was not above chance).<br /><br />Is there something intrinsic encoded in BOLD signal fluctuations that can predict who we will find appealing (and a potential “match) after a three minute interaction?&nbsp; Decisions at speed dating events are mostly based on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.768" target="_blank">physical attractiveness</a>, so it seems very implausible to me.<p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Further Reading (the Speed Dating Collection)</b></p><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-neuroscience-of-speed-dating-choice.html">The Neuroscience of Speed Dating Choice</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-electroencephalogram-cocktail-party.html">The Electroencephalogram Cocktail Party</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/eeg-speed-dating.html">EEG Speed Dating</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/journal-of-speed-dating-studies.html">The Journal of Speed Dating Studies</a><br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span><span><span><span><span><span><p><b>Winner of Best Title <br /></b></p><p><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780824882822-013/html" target="_blank">How I Meditated with Your Mother: Speed Dating at Temples and Shrines in Contemporary Japan</a></p></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>References</b></p><div class="gs_citr" tabindex="0">Geerligs L, Rubinov M, Henson RN.

<p><em>Pseudomonas fragi</em> A13BB, recovered as part of study to identify novel antibiotic-producing bacterial strains from soil samples collected from the rhizosphere, has been sequenced for antibiotic producing gene clusters and has been published as the <a href="https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0">first Data </a><a href="https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0">Note</a> in <em>BMC Genomic Data</em>.  Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are one of the components of the rhizosphere, where they promote plant growth by enhancing uptake of nutrients, inorganic elements, or by increasing resistance to heavy metals, high salt concentrations, phytopathogens and more.</p>
<p>Two β-lactone secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGC) known for their antibiotic, antiobesity and anticancer properties, were identified and demonstrated low homology (20%) to known smBGCs. A siderophore (a small compound secreted usually to transfer iron across cell membranes) smBGC was identified even though <em>P. fragi</em> is considered a non-siderophore producing member of the genus <em>Pseudomonas.</em></p>

<p>This <a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-021-00416-4">study</a> was intended to identify trends in the variety and amount of imported sweetened beverages (SB) to Pacific Island countries (and the impact of the SB taxes on imports in Fiji and Tonga). A major cause of death and sickness in these countries is nutrition-related chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The authors found there was an increase in SB imports into pacific island countries between these dates which needs to be considered for health implications by both exporting and importing countries as this has a detrimental impact on diet and self-sufficiency. Diet high in processed foods is well known to have an impact on health. There was a statistically significant increase in SB imports to Tonga but too little data for assessment of taxes.</p>

<p>Thirty five members of NHS secondary mental health services (England) undertook an interview based study and were found to face difficulties that impacted significantly on their well-being during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The lockdown in England in response to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-19 had impact on all Healthcare workers but that on the mental Healthcare workers has been under-reported. The quality of life for respondents was affected by their challenge of providing care in constrained and potentially dangerous situations and losing patients to the disease. Taking on additional tasks to provide a better service for their patients led to additional strain. Feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout were all reported. The response to the pandemic meant that services had to rapidly adapt to major incident mode at the same time as the needs of service users increased. Moral injury has resulted to some after exposure to this event.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-021-03261-8">study</a> has pointed to areas where additional support could be targeted. One Implication is loss of staff but this has not been explicitly stated.</p>

<p>Cells from donors with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can now be grown into brain organoids and the resulting research is opening up our understanding of the aetiology of ASD. Brain organoids are allowing the exploration into genetic, developmental and other factors involved which makes this unique from other forms of research. Researchers often incorporate the medical model of disability into ASD research.</p>
<p>The neurodiversity movement is likely to disagree with approaches and aims of cerebral research in ASD as the developmental disability movement and paradigm understands autism as a form of human diversity and advocates a model based on social, attitudinal, and environmental barriers rather than any deficits.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12443" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12443" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 239px"><img class="wp-image-12443" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Organoid_during_development_48062903426.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="172" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12443" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">NIH Image Gallery from Bethesda, Maryland, USA, via Wikimedia Commons</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00627-1">authors</a> give three recommendations that should minimise any conflict and achieve a more holistic, inclusive approach to cerebral organoid research on ASD.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; neurodiverse individuals should be included as co-creators in both the scientific process and research communication.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; clinicians and neurodiverse communities should have open and respectful communication.</p>
<p>3 &#8211; a continual reconceptualization of illness, impairment, disability, behavior, and person should be achieved.</p>
<p>Researchers are advised to be careful not to combine disease with impairment or disability and also consider how best to communicate their ideas with respect and care.</p>

<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as impaired glucose tolerance with onset or first recognized during pregnancy. It is fairly prevalent with a figure of 15-20% reported globally. Hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12445" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12445" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 233px"><img class="wp-image-12445" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/640px-Pregnancy_-_belly.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="149" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/640px-Pregnancy_-_belly.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/640px-Pregnancy_-_belly-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12445" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Towle Neu, CC BY 2.5 via Wikimedia Commons</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vitamin and mineral supplementation such as vitamin D, vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium  may regulate glucose metabolism and have beneficial roles in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress.; does it help in GDM? The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with GDM have not been well established but this <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-021-00712-x">meta-analysis</a> hoped to rectify that.</p>
<p>The Authors’ findings are that vitamin and mineral supplementation; magnesium, zinc, selenium, calcium, vitamin D and E (alone or in combination), significantly improved glycemic control, lessened inflammation and oxidative stress in women with GDM through decreasing serum Fasting Plasma Glucose, insulin, and other levels, and increasing total antioxidant capacity levels.</p>

<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re always evolving our services to make sharing discoveries as easy as possible for researchers. To help authors save time and effort in the article submission process, all PLOS journals offer format-free initial submission for authors submitting research articles. Learn more about this service before you get started on your next submission.</p>



<p><strong>What is Format-Free Submission?</strong></p>



<p>Format-free submission is part of our 3-step submission process which includes:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Initial submission. </strong>Participating journals waive all formatting requirements and will request formatting changes only after initial editorial evaluation or initial peer review depending on the journal. Simply upload your manuscript in a single PDF file (which can include text and figures) and submit to the journal&rsquo;s online submission system.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Editorial assessment. </strong>Our editors and reviewers review and provide initial feedback on your submission as quickly as possible.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Full submission. </strong>Make any additional formatting changes only after initial feedback is received.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Together, these 3 steps are designed to help ease initial submission so you spend as little time in the article submission process as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Getting started</strong></p>



<p>To ensure your format-free submission is complete and gets handled as quickly as possible, be sure to review the submission checklists and guidelines provided by our journal editorial teams. Click a journal name below to learn more:</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about a paper &quot;A Spiking Neural Program for Sensorimotor Control during Foraging in Flying Insects&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral
strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been
described in detail for various species. To explore the link between
underlying neural circuits and computational principles, we present
how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect
mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning, and motor
control. We focus on cast and surge strategies employed by flying
insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-
based plasticity rule, the model rapidly learns to associate
individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical
conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system
dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex
sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time
scales generates cast-and-surge motor commands. Our generic systems
approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning,
while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and
precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological
computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows
how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic
conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as
inspiration for agent-based machine learning.</p>

                <img width="140" height="90" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/logo-bmcproc-pr-140x90.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Greater inclusion of individuals from underrepresented demographics in STEM fields has long been a goal for many disciplines. As the culture of STEM evolves towards greater inclusivity, providing equitable access to talented individuals of all backgrounds has become a key priority. Diversity not only in academic expertise but in demographics is increasingly recognized as a source of collective strength that correlates with success and innovation.</p>
<p>Scientific societies have historically sought to cultivate diverse membership through an educational model that supports scientist participation in activities that prepare them for upcoming career transitions. While this methodology is broadly applied across many different disciplines, societies are now coordinating their efforts and using data to evaluate outcomes and identify <a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0262">opportunities</a> to improve impact.</p>
<p>In the process, scientific societies have found themselves well-suited to offer field-specific career development opportunities that complement the traditional instruction and training provided at academic institutions. Trainees in the process of developing into independent academic scientists must cultivate a combination of disciplinary knowledge and complementary soft skills in order to navigate demands such as grant-writing, collaboration, mentoring, and publishing—skills that are fundamental to success in the professoriate.</p>
<p>Scientists from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM are less likely to have access to mentoring, making it more challenging to develop the soft skills necessary to facilitate success as tenure-track faculty. Scientific society professional development programming geared towards these scientists can have an equalizer effect, enabling them to successfully build their academic niche and professorial career in field areas of interest to <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">BioMed Central</a> (BMC) such as science, technology, engineering and medicine. The <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v21i1.1941">Minorities Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell Biology</a> (ASCB) has a strong track record of creating professional development programs to help relieve these disparities in access to mentoring.</p>
<p>One example of ASCB MAC programming is its <a href="https://www.ascb.org/career-development/2021-accomplishing-career-transitions-act-program/">Accomplishing Career Transitions (ACT) program</a>. ACT engages cell biologists who are starting out their independent careers to individualize their professional development and training through a longitudinal mentoring framework. ASCB aims to prepare ACT Fellows for a successful transition into the academic STEM workforce.</p>
<p>Our new BMC Proceedings Supplement, highlights topics including effective mentorship, obtaining a faculty position, starting a lab, preparing for tenure and promotion, and professional development through experiential learning.</p>
<p>The content of this BMC Proceedings Supplement is more important now than ever, as rising faculty adapt their career trajectories to global challenges. Our short term goal with this <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-15-supplement-2">BMC Proceedings Supplement</a> is to make the ACT program available to a wider range of  scientists to help them prepare for success in academia. Their success will contribute to a diverse professoriate that is inclusive and welcoming of the next generation of scientists.</p>

<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02402-1">Ali <em>et al</em>.</a> set out to validate the KFRE in advanced CKD taking into account their cause of CKD (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other causes.  The KFRE performed well across all diseases and was found to have adequate discrimination and calibration.  What I found to be very interesting was that the KFRE provided better clinical utility for decision-making like pre-ESKD planning than basing it on GFR cutoffs alone.  Typically, we start planning for transplant evaluations, dialysis education, dialysis access placement, etc when the <a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(15)01019-7/pdf">eGFR is &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2</a> (in this study they used &lt; 20 and &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2).  with using the KFRE in Ali <em>et al.</em>, they identified more patients who were likely to progress to ESKD and delay in others by using KFRE thresholds of &gt; 40% for 2-year risk and &gt; 50% for 5-year risk of ESKD.</p>
<p>Identifying patients who are progressing to ESKD is kept in planning for dialysis modality, access placement, and transplant referral.  If we can catch individuals early and start the process then there are fewer hospitalizations and poor outcomes.  Other studies have addressed using the KFRE in the necessity of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835850/">nephrology referrals</a> and using it as a risk-based approach to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375884">guide CKD care</a>.</p>
<p>Based on my review of the literature and Ali <em>et al</em>.’s article, I definitely will start using the KFRE in my clinical assessment and planning for patients with advanced CKD.  Maybe it will help identify those patients who will benefit from early referral to transplant and access placement or at the least early education endeavors for those patients.  I can only see positives from using the KFRE as another clinical tool.</p>
<p>What are other additional uses of the KFRE in your practice?</p>

                <p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce a new arXivLabs collaboration with <a href="https://www.litmaps.co/">Litmaps</a>. The new <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXivLabs</a> feature allows arXiv users to quickly generate a citation map of the top connected articles, and then explore the citation network using the Litmaps research platform.</p>
<p>A citation network is a visualization of the literature cited by a research paper. The network shows how papers are related to each other in terms of concepts, subject areas, and history &#8212; and they&#8217;re valuable for <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">analyzing the development of research areas, making decisions on research directions, and assessing the impacts of research, researchers, institutes, countries, and individual papers.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Readers can now view a Litmap citation network for a specific paper, directly from the arXiv abstract page by clicking on the &#8220;Bibliographic Tools&#8221; tab at the bottom of an abstract page and activating &#8220;Litmaps.&#8221; Using this tool, arXiv readers can now easily jump from articles they are interested in and use Litmaps&#8217; custom visualization and automated search tools to find other critical articles they may have missed.</p>

<p>“We are excited to be able to offer arXiv readers new visual ways to explore scientific literature. Litmaps will enrich the arXiv reading experience and help readers find what they need,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv.</p>
<p>This tool supports arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>
<p>“We are arXiv users ourselves at Litmaps, so it&#8217;s great to be able to collaborate and integrate with arXiv, which is a key resource for the research community,” said Axton Pitt, cofounder of Litmaps. The company aims to make the process of literature discovery easy and fun, and welcomes feedback via <a href="https://twitter.com/LitmapsApp">Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:team@litmaps.co">email</a>.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Bente Riegler will talk about a paper &quot;Toward a New Theory of Motor Synergies&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Driven by recent empirical studies, we offer a new understanding of
the degrees of freedom problem, and propose a refined concept of
synergy as a neural organization that ensures a one-to-many mapping of
variables providing for both stability of important performance
variables and flexibility of motor patterns to deal with possible
perturbations and/or secondary tasks. Empirical evidence is reviewed,
including a discussion of the operationalization of
stability/flexibility through the method of the uncontrolled manifold.
We show how this concept establishes links between the various
accounts for how movement is organized in redundant effector systems.</p>

The foundation fosters and supports research on all aspects of computer vision, a field of study that develops techniques to see and interpret the visual world, with applications ranging from diagnosing disease to evaluating agricultural crop quality.</p>
<p>“We didn’t donate because we were asked,” said Ramin Zabih, president and founder of CVF, Cornell Tech professor, and Google research scientist. “We donated because we love arXiv.”</p>
<p>Open access is a central tenet of the foundation, which (along with <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>) cosponsors the two main computer vision conferences, <a href="http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/">CVPR</a> and <a href="http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home">ICCV</a>. Before the pandemic, CVPR drew more than 10,000 attendees. CVF also provides open access to the proceedings for these conferences.</p>
<p>“Without arXiv, the computer vision field would not advance at anything close to its current speed,” said Zabih. Conferences and journals are both useful venues for presenting and peer reviewing results. But the pace of research is fast, and arXiv provides an invaluable vehicle for rapid research sharing between conference and journal cycles. Plus, while the high bar for acceptance to conferences and journals serves an important purpose, arXiv provides a platform for lesser-known researchers to make their mark. “High profile researchers will always have ways to share their work, say, by being invited to give talks. arXiv levels the playing field,” said Zabih.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">arXiv recently launched an updated sustainability model</a>, which distributes arXiv’s operational costs fairly across our dedicated community. This donation was the first Gold Affiliate through this sustainability model and is a continuation of The Computer Vision Foundation’s support, which began in 2019.</p>
<p>Like earlier donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Heising-Simons Foundation, and Google, Inc, this contribution supports arXiv’s critical infrastructure improvements and integration with the scholarly communications landscape.</p>
<p>“arXiv has been operating in maintenance mode for quite some time,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv’s executive director. “With generous support from organizations like The Computer Vision Foundation, arXiv can innovate for the future.”</p>

                Abstract:  The goal of the open access (OA) movement is to help everyone access the scholarly research, not just those who can afford to. However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research. This study sought to answer whether the news media mentions OA articles more or less than paywalled articles by looking at articles published from 2010 through 2018 in journals across all four quartiles of the Journal Impact Factor using data obtained through Altmetric.com and the Web of Science. Gold, green and hybrid OA articles all had a positive correlation with the number of news mentions received. News mentions for OA articles did see a dip in 2018, although they remained higher than those for paywalled articles.

                <p>So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is <em>research</em>.</p>

<p>Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I&#8217;m working on in the broadest sense, &#8220;How does the brain work?&#8221;, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing. However, I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to &#8220;invent&#8221; new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Because I always know what I&#8217;m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn&#8217;t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5M-OIn0aZ8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I&#8217;m only aware of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok">interviews in German</a> without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?</p>



<p>To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There&#8217;s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to embrace them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn&#8217;t really know what she&#8217;s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.</p>



<p>It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.</p>



<p>Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.</p>



<p>These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than &#8220;pure&#8221; research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of &#8220;aims&#8221;. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.</p>



<p>However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods &#8211; but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. </p>



<p>I think that also researchers in &#8220;hard&#8221; sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper &quot;Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">For the past few months, I&#8217;ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. </p>



<p>At that scale, it&#8217;s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that&#8217;s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/trends">25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code</a>, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don&#8217;t want to support it.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.</p>

<h2>Decision points</h2>



<h3>Local vs. cloud</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a> class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.</p>



<p>I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using <strong>paperspace gradient</strong> for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called <em>experiments</em> which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn&#8217;t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/">AWS Batch</a>, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.</p>



<h3>Code organization</h3>



<p>One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a <strong>docker</strong> container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. </p>



<p>This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea &#8211; you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won&#8217;t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn&#8217;t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></strong>, using <strong><a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a></strong> as an autoformatter.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you&#8217;re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity &#8211; and then some &#8211; is to switch to <strong><a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html">test-driven development</a></strong>. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don&#8217;t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn&#8217;t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.</p>



<p>I enabled <strong><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> (CI)</strong> in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn&#8217;t end up using it. It does look like it&#8217;s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via <a href="https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g">nvidia-docker</a>.</p>



<p>I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html">PyRSE</a>. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">I ended up using the <strong>datascience cookiecutter</strong></a> for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).</p>



<h3>TF vs. PyTorch</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use <strong>PyTorch</strong> this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider <a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">PyTorch Lightning</a>.</p>



<h3>Storing results</h3>



<p>One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don&#8217;t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. </p>



<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:</p>



<ul><li>each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)</li><li>you can safely delete stale results</li><li>you can query results to find the subet which you&#8217;re interested in</li><li>you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)</li></ul>



<p>You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using <strong><a href="http://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a></strong> (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png"><img data-attachment-id="7695" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-4-3/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" data-orig-size="3026,1560" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Wandb dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=723" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7695" /></a><figcaption>Wandb dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a></strong>, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.</p>



<p>Locally, I do still use <strong>tensorboard</strong> to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it&#8217;s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it&#8217;s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) &#8211; pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.</p>



<h3>Analyzing results</h3>



<p>I use <strong>jupyterlab</strong> locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don&#8217;t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn&#8217;t play well with git &#8211; the diffs are meaningless. I will try out <strong><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a></strong>, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. </p>



<h2>Mistakes I made</h2>



<p>I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. </p>



<p>That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading &#8211; some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format &#8211; I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. </p>



<p><strong>What I should have done</strong> is have one true intermediate format &#8211; e.g. <strong><a href="https://www.nwb.org/">NWB</a></strong> &#8211; I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a <strong>FAIR</strong> format in the intermediate stage &#8211; it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats &#8211; I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits &#8211; two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.</p>



<p>I experimented a bit with using <strong>make</strong> to create the intermediate format, and I think it&#8217;s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don&#8217;t exist but won&#8217;t try to recreate them if they&#8217;re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. </p>



<h2>Releasing code and models</h2>



<p>I didn&#8217;t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It&#8217;s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of <strong><a href="https://github.com/replicate/cog">cog</a></strong>, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on <strong><a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a></strong> (free bandwidth!)</p>

<html><body><p>The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime&nbsp;location&nbsp;to conduct oceanographic research and features&nbsp;a&nbsp;wealth of scientific expertise.&nbsp;However, as in many&nbsp;institutions, the pool of&nbsp;oceanographic&nbsp;researchers can be quite homogenous.&nbsp;UCT researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://katyealtieri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katye Altieri</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Fawcett</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Isabelle Ansorge</a>&nbsp;realized that while&nbsp;the&nbsp;academic staff in the&nbsp;Department of&nbsp;Oceanography at UCT is comprised of&nbsp;~50% womxn, it is 100% white.&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;in 2019,&nbsp;amongst postgraduates in the department,&nbsp;there&nbsp;were only 12 Black African and&nbsp;Coloured&nbsp;South African womxn out of 73 students.&nbsp;The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community.&nbsp;Altieri says&nbsp;that&nbsp;she and her colleagues&nbsp;saw&nbsp;an opportunity to create&nbsp;&ldquo;a dedicated&nbsp;programme&nbsp;that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south&rdquo;.

<p>The result is&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanwomxn.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ocean Womxn</strong></a>, a program funded for an 5 year&nbsp;initial&nbsp;period, that aims to&nbsp;remove barriers&nbsp;and provide support&nbsp;for&nbsp;Black womxn in oceanography.&nbsp;In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows&nbsp;receive&nbsp;comprehensive&nbsp;support&nbsp;&ndash; this includes&nbsp;financial cover for the duration of their&nbsp;degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They&nbsp;also&nbsp;have&nbsp;sea-going opportunities, such as&nbsp;SEAmester&nbsp;cruises, where they can develop lab skills and&nbsp;receive hands-on experience.

<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong>&nbsp;Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong>&nbsp;I would&nbsp;definitely say&nbsp;the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is&nbsp;definitely the&nbsp;exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong>&nbsp;My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a &ldquo;burden of service&rdquo;, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong>&nbsp;For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a &ldquo;burden of service&rdquo;, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project&nbsp;Kuongoza&nbsp;Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now &ldquo;serving&rdquo; my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of &ldquo;burden of service&rdquo; I have the responsibility to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong>&nbsp;What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong>&nbsp;I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and&nbsp;honour&nbsp;for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong>&nbsp;My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa&rsquo;s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong>&nbsp;Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong>&nbsp;My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:&nbsp;</strong>Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong>&nbsp;More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science:&nbsp;to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong>&nbsp;I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the &ldquo;openness&rdquo; of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong>&nbsp;I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication?&nbsp;</p>

                <blockquote><p>Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p>Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.</p></blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.digitalscholarshipleiden.nl/articles/tips-for-making-open-access-books">Tips for making open access books - Digital Scholarship Leiden</a></h4>

              
                Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning&nbsp;[3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN&nbsp;[4].</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/">Brian Simulator</a> is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian&#8217;s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to&nbsp;start.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model&#8217;s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain&nbsp;models.</p>

<br /><p>Join us for a <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org">OCNS</a>) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021">here</a>.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.</p>
<p>The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.</p>
<p>To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/">https://labs.fedoraproject.org/</a> .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.</p>

                <p>As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you&#8217;re studying. If you read the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> docs or you browse <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill</a>, you&#8217;ll see impressive browser-based visualizations &#8211; interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew &#8211; at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.</p>

Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex">pycortex library</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you&#8217;ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?</p>



<p>A big wall you&#8217;ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it&#8217;s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I&#8217;ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Technology</th><th>Application areas</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th><th>What you learn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Python-based generators</td><td>Dashboards, lightweight interactions</td><td>Easy distribution, low barrier to entry</td><td>Limited interactivity</td><td>Grammar of interactive graphics</td></tr><tr><td>Jupyter notebook</td><td>Daily data exploration</td><td>You&#8217;re already using it!</td><td>Distribution not straightforward</td><td>Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG</td></tr><tr><td>Walled garden</td><td>All-in-one visualizations (widgets)</td><td>Limited things to learn</td><td>What you learn is non-transferable</td><td>The walled garden</td></tr><tr><td>JS notebooks</td><td>Literate programs</td><td>REPL environment, good docs</td><td>Learning curve a bit steep</td><td>Core JS plus visualization libraries</td></tr><tr><td>The web</td><td>Web dataviz</td><td>You control everything</td><td>Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep</td><td>Packaging, components, deployment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I&#8217;ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2>Step 0: Python-based libraries</h2>



<p>Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging pure Python-based libraries. Many libraries aim to fill a niche for everyday interactive graphics, which include minimal interactions &#8211; hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc. This includes <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>, <a href="http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html">Bokeh w/Holoviews</a> and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html">Altair w/vegalite</a>. On the mapping side, <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet">ipyleaflet</a> is worth mentioning.</p>



<h3>Dashboard tools</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png"><img data-attachment-id="7657" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-2-4/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png" data-orig-size="838,742" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=723" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-7657" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=600 600w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/">A demo visualization in streamlit</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There has been an <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617">explosive growth in the past few years</a>. These solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what to expect: a Python script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, such as sliders and combo boxes. The whole thing gets served via a server which caches requests intelligently &#8211; changes in sliders trigger remote fetches which refresh the visualization. Some custom visualizations may be written in JS. Oftentimes, dashboard solutions are associated with a specific plotting library. so all the docs will be written in terms of that library &#8211; but generally you have some flexibility to use other frameworks.</p>



<p>One clarification: if you want to share your visualizations, you&#8217;ll need a server. All solutions have a basic open source offering allowing you to DIY deploy such a server yourself via e.g. a cloud provider. If that sounds messy, you can instead opt for a managed cloud solution &#8211; there&#8217;s often a free tier and paid tiers with more capabilities availables. Here they are:</p>

<h2>Step 1: build for jupyter notebook</h2>



<p>Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you&#8217;re writing Python inside the browser <em>right now</em>, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you&#8217;re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world &#8211; at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.</p>



<h3>_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Image" width="417" height="126" /><figcaption>Basic demo of _repr_html_</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a <code>_repr_html_</code> method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing">See this colab for examples on how to do this</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669">You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method</a>, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. </p>



<p>You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output">using the ipython API</a>. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;'))
</pre></div>


<h3>ipywidgets and interact</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>ipywidgets</strong>, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb">interactive HTML widgets</a> for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.</p><cite><a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">The ipywidget manual</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Next in line in complexity are <code>ipywidgets</code>. Like <code>IPython.core.display</code>, <code>ipywidgets</code> can display rich HTML; however, <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html">widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python</a>. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5">See this notebook for an example</a>. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there&#8217;s a convenience function called <code>interact</code> which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.</p>



<h3>voila</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif" alt="" /><figcaption><a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">Voila example, from their docs</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called <a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">voila</a>. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Walled gardens</h2>



<p>At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it&#8217;s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing <em>real javascript</em> in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.</p>



<h3>Unity</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> is a game development engine and IDE. It&#8217;s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html" target="_blank">difficult to interact with the native DOM</a>. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool &#8211; it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can&#8217;t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you&#8217;re doing 3d viz.</p>



<h3>p5.js and openprocessing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe width='723' height='723' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/fFfFCoFY?preloadContent=metadata&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1626817383'></script>
</div><figcaption><br><br>OpenProcessing sketch, <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689">Self-organized critical model</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://openprocessing.org/">openprocessing</a> bring processing &#8211; a creative coding platform &#8211; to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you&#8217;re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don&#8217;t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you&#8217;ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won&#8217;t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. &#8211; and you&#8217;ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Javascript notebooks</h2>



<p>The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web &#8211; html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. &#8211; but you&#8217;re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. </p>



<p>For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it &#8211; for many use cases, json will do the trick.</p>



<h3>Observable</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="7664" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png" data-orig-size="603,602" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-7664" width="573" height="572" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=573 573w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png 603w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></a><figcaption>Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example">Code here</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  <a href="https://observablehq.com/tutorials">It has an excellent set of starter tutorials</a>. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed &#8211; they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript">it does not use Javascript</a>, and it doesn&#8217;t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it &#8211; however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.</p>



<h3>Starboard</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif"><img data-attachment-id="7671" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif" data-orig-size="380,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coupled-oscillators" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" alt="" class="wp-image-7671" /></a><figcaption>An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. <a href="https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://starboard.gg/">Starboard</a> is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>. What&#8217;s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it&#8217;s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.&#8221; </p><cite>Pyodide docs</cite></blockquote>



<p>That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary &#8211; though you&#8217;ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like <a href="https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite">jupyterlite</a> are carrying the torch. I really like starboard &#8211; the editor feels great, it&#8217;s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.</p>



<h2>Step 4: the web</h2>



<p>Now you&#8217;ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you&#8217;re ready to tackle the world &#8211; the world wide web! It&#8217;s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + &#8230;) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets &#8211; html, the dom, css, svg, etc. &#8211; are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>, might satisfy your needs. </p>



<p>One very annoying gotcha you&#8217;ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you&#8217;ll use for data analysis in JS &#8211; like mathjs &#8211; were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you&#8217;ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack</a> and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));</code></pre>



<p>Thanks to Guido Zuidhof <a href="https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42">for patiently explaining this to me</a>.</p>



<p>Some templates exist to facilitate the creation of interactive blog posts or articles. Most notably, the <a href="https://github.com/distillpub/template">distill template</a> and <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">the Idyll language</a> facilitate the creation of explanatory articles (think those cool articles on the nytimes website which highlight different parts of graphs when you scroll down). Some of the best examples of this type of article can be seen on the <a href="https://visxai.io/">VISxAI website</a>.</p>



<p>For deployment, provided you don&#8217;t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">flask</a> deployed on <a href="https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku">heroku</a> would do the trick.</p>



<h2>JS libraries</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there&#8217;s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:</p>



<ul><li>d3: data driven documents in JS, <a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a></li><li>mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: <a href="https://mathjs.org/">https://mathjs.org/</a></li><li>stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib</a></li><li>Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/</a></li><li>Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">https://www.tensorflow.org/js</a></li><li>Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: <a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a></li><li>Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: <a href="https://github.com/uwdata/arquero">https://github.com/uwdata/arquero</a></li></ul>



<p>I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you&#8217;ll be ready to make solid visualizations!</p>

<h2>Two flexible alternatives<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the <strong>Champion</strong> membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year">primarily for reading</a> or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, <strong>Community</strong> membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv&#8217;s governance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/arxiv-sustainability-model/">Announcing arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a></h4>

              
                <p>In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a>. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors &#8212; and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.</p>
<p>For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise &#8212; and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:</p>
<p><b>Members </b></p>
<p>Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes</a> across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv&#8217;s governance. <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">Learn more about updates to the membership program here.</a></p>
<p><b>Affiliates</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits </a>collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become an affiliate or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sponsors</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Companies</a> that benefit from arXiv&#8217;s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become a sponsor or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">submissions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads">downloads</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">seamless interoperability with other platforms</li>
<li aria-level="1">increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information</li>
<li aria-level="1">modernization of backend services and technological infrastructure for improved stability, performance and innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you already support arXiv, thank you! If not, we encourage you to consider how you or your organization can get involved. You’re invited to <a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org">contact us</a> to start the conversation.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper &quot;Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.</p>

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7" target="_blank">Erik Hoel (2021)</a>:<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of <i>overfitting</i>,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[sic]</span></span> hypothesis.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”</p><blockquote><p>The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). <br /><b>. . .</b><br /></p><p>To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">artificial neural networks</a> for image classification, which was all the rage in July&nbsp;2015.

                <h2>Where is the spinothalamic tract?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract is a collection of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations. The pathway starts with sensory neurons that synapse in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a>. Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation" target="_blank">decussate</a>, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a>, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a>. These neurons synapse with neurons in the thalamus, which then carry the information to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>. See below for more details on the pathway of the spinothalamic tract.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>What is the spinothalamic tract and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract actually consists of two pathways that are distinct in function: the anterior spinothalamic tract and the lateral spinothalamic tract. </p><h3>Lateral spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. </p><p class="">Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor" target="_blank">nociceptors</a>, which detect painful sensations, or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor" target="_blank">thermoreceptors</a>, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a> that belong to cell groups like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius" target="_blank">nucleus proprius</a> or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa" target="_blank">substantia gelatinosa</a>; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.</p><p class="">The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl" target="_blank">ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus</a> in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system" target="_blank">anterolateral system</a>. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.</p><h3>Anterior spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. </p><p class="">These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.</p><h3>Damage to the spinothalamic tract</h3><p class="">A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.</p><h3>References:</h3><p class="">Augustine JR.

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper &quot;Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.</p>

<p>It has already been a month since we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">announced</a> we&rsquo;re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The responses we&rsquo;ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We&rsquo;d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals&ndash;we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.</p>



<p>The journals&rsquo; websites now contain much more information on each&nbsp; journal&rsquo;s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></li></ul>



<p>If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate &ldquo;jumping off point&rdquo; for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. <strong>Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!</strong></p>



<p>For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/">Part 2 of this announcement</a>.</p>

This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we&rsquo;ve developed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank">Flat Fee </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank">a</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank">greements</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing</a>. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We&rsquo;re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we&rsquo;ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Institutional models for the five new journals</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/" target="_blank">PLOS Digital Health</a></em></strong> joins the group of journals covered by <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fee agreements</a> (covering <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>)</li><li><strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/" target="_blank">PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</a></em></strong> has its own <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing</a> setup, similar to <em>PLOS Biology </em>and <em>PLOS Medicine, </em>to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.</li><li><strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/" target="_blank">PLOS Climate</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/water/" target="_blank">PLOS Water</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/" target="_blank">PLOS Global Public Health</a></em></strong> offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the &ldquo;Global Equity&rdquo; model.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Global Equity </strong></h4>



<p>Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:</p>



<ul><li>an <strong>institution&rsquo;s </strong>research output in the relevant <strong>subject area</strong>,<strong> </strong>helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and&nbsp;</li><li>the relevant <strong>country&rsquo;s </strong>World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Global Equity model&rsquo;s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Authors at institutions in </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/" target="_blank"><strong>Research4Life</strong></a><strong> (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.</strong></p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper &quot;Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.</p>

                <p>To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point <em>t</em>, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time <em>t</em> is required. Our algorithm <em>Cascade</em> (<a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>; CC-BY-NC 4.0):</p>

<p>However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (&#8220;online spike inference&#8221;), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.</p>



<p><a href="http://ringachlab.net/">Dario Ringach</a> recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point <em>t</em> to perform reliable spike inference?</p>



<p>Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of &#8220;2&#8221; is pretty decent, while a noise level of &#8220;8&#8221; is quite noisy &#8211; explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.</p>

<p>The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).</p>



<p>It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after <em>t</em> are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.</p>

<p>For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">Fig. S1 of the preprint</a>) are indeed faster than for other datasets.</p>



<p>Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after <em>t</em> before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005">calcium buffering</a> and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.</p>



<p>The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py">Cascade&#8217;s Github repository</a>. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>



<ol><li> Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time<em> t</em> are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.<br /></li><li>To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.</li></ol>

                <p>We’re excited to announce our collaboration with <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers With Code</a> to support links to datasets on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>!</p>
<p>Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.</p>
<figure id="attachment_979" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-979" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-979 size-full" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png" alt="screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages" width="400" height="539" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png 400w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-979" class="wp-caption-text">From the &#8220;Code &amp; Data&#8221; tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to <a href="https://arxiv.org/login">arxiv.org/user</a> and clicking on the “Link to code &amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article&#8217;s abstract page.</p>
<p>This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.</p>
<p>All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>An arXivLabs Collaboration<br />
</b></p>
<p>arXiv&#8217;s mission is to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research. Datasets are a critical component of this.</p>
<p>This is the second stage of our <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs collaboration</a> with Papers with Code, following <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">the introduction of code on arXiv</a> last October.</p>
<p>“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/A3RHpxFPTbk/">Partnering with TCC Africa</a></h4>

<html><body><p>Author: <strong>Roheena Anand</strong>, Director, Global Publishing Development, PLOS</p>



<p>Two weeks ago we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves &ldquo;<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open for Whom?</a>&rdquo; Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Today</strong>, as our first major step, we&rsquo;re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Training Centre in Communication</a></strong>, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCC Africa</a></strong>. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They&rsquo;re committed to improving African researchers&rsquo; visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.</p>



<p>Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it&rsquo;s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.</p>



<p>Please follow PLOS and TCC Africa on social media, and/or follow our blogs, to keep up to date on the progress of this partnership!</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/">10+ years of Brainhack: an open, inclusive culture for neuro tool developers at all levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2">in Neuron</a>, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.</p>



<p>Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global &#8211; a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Figure 1D from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001" rel="nofollow">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001</a></p>



<p>A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>



<p>The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.</p>



<h2>The five defining Brainhack features:&nbsp;</h2>



<p>1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving</p>



<p>2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods</p>



<p>3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators</p>



<p>4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and </p>



<p>5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages</p>



<p>Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.</p>



<p>The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/">Jupyter Book </a>&nbsp;that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8JaXnrQyfik/">An update on Lab and Study Protocols at PLOS ONE</a></h4>

<p>PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">launch</a> of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in <em>PLOS ONE</em> earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we&rsquo;re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>The first, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435">Satoru Joshita and colleagues</a>, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791">John Cole and colleagues</a>, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations.&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>Cole writes, &ldquo;Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They&rsquo;re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols">Submission Guidelines</a> have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols">Lab Protocol</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. This unique article type was developed in partnership with <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a>, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/05/01/heating-up-the-objective-for-two-photon-imaging/">Heating up the objective for two-photon imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>; see also <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012">Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012</a>). Is this a problem?</p>



<p>Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493">Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020</a>), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.</p>



<p>For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial <a href="http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater">objective heating device</a> with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author <a href="https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038">Serge Charpak</a> was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy <a href="https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html">thermocouple</a> element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.</p>



<p>Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.</p>

Not hot enough.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor &#8211; therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other &#8211; and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.</p>

Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (<a href="https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx">this one</a>). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.</p>



<p>Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was <a href="https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf">this one</a>) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (<a href="https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/">explained here</a>). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. </p>

We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.</p>



<p>Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! </p>



<p>The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://ceup.openingthefuture.net/news/4/">Announcing the first OA book funded entirely by library membership programme ‘Opening the Future’</a></h4>

              
                Roll out of first open access books fully funded by Opening the Future

We're thrilled to announce that our Opening the Future library membership programme has reached the threshold needed to begin funding the first titles in open access.

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

More Information

For libraries or other institutions that want to support the move to immediate OA, without author-facing charges, more information can be found at https://ceup.openingthefuture.net/. For further details on the pricing and structure of the model, see the FAQs and resources web pages.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JdJdcrkMka4/">The importance of early career researchers for promoting open research</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS&rsquo; Director of Open Research Solutions</p>



<p><em>Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers &ndash; as found in PLOS research released as a<a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/"> preprint this week</a>.</em></p>



<p>At the end of March 2021 <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">introduced</a> a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal&rsquo;s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large &ndash; determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal&rsquo;s community of editors and researchers.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725">more than 40%</a> of papers published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>voluntarily shared their code already, <em>requiring</em> more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:<br></p>



<ul><li>Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?</li><li>What proportion of researchers&rsquo; papers generate code?</li><li>What concerns do they have about code sharing?</li><li>How common are these concerns?</li><li>How much would submissions to the journal be affected?</li><li>Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?</li></ul>



<p>Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025">survey dataset</a> that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">released as a preprin</a>t. As well as supporting the journal&rsquo;s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing &ndash; relative to other open research practices such as data sharing &ndash; and researchers&rsquo; experiences with sharing code and software.</p>



<p>The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which &mdash; at least in principle &mdash; would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns &mdash; a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents&rsquo; previous publications could have shared code.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="433" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18885" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png 1006w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1-300x129.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1-768x331.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"></figure>



<p>Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 <a href="https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1">peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society</a>, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 2.</em></strong><em> Respondents were asked &ldquo;If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?&rdquo;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="249" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18886" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png 512w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure>



<p>Also, similar to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/">what we discovered about researchers&rsquo; needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020</a>, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share <em>their own</em> code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers&rsquo; code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal&rsquo;s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility &ndash; and ultimately reuse &ndash; of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper &quot;Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.</p>

<p class="">The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlear</a> nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus" target="_blank">inferior colliculus</a>, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.</p><h2><br>References:</h2><p class="">Paul MS, M Das J.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218">Matteo Carandini raised a question</a>: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">a double-exponential curve</a>: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png" alt="Doubling times" width="753" height="528" /><figcaption>image <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png">CC BY Steve Jurvetson</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662">Urai et al. (2021)</a> &#8211; generously released under a CC-BY license &#8211; and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (<a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times">code here</a>). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It&#8217;s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature &#8211; 4.5 years. </p>

<p>On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers &#8211; hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that&#8217;s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. </p>



<p>We can do one better &#8211; fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> &#8211; a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="7617" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png" data-orig-size="779,527" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779" alt="" class="wp-image-7617" width="408" height="276" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=408 408w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=768 768w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png 779w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time &#8211; and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].</p>

<p>These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 &#8211; of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.</p>

<p>The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, <a href="https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/">including Facebook</a>, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1">adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors</a> to electrophysiology. </p>



<p>Thus, this generalized Moore&#8217;s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes &#8211; but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995">and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this</a>.</p>



<p>Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time &#8211; perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain&#8217;t what it used to be, and it&#8217;s coming far faster than we&#8217;ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There&#8217;s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is &#8211; perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:</p>

These are doubling times are nevertheless shorter than the ones reported previously in the literature so far, so the larger point still stands: the future is happening faster than we thought just a few years ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/ihstevenson/status/1387439844641628161">Read the thread here</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FJ2pmGTKCuU/">To boldly grow: five new journals shaped by Open Science</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1120" height="630" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif" alt="PLOS announces new journals" class="wp-image-18866"></figure>



<p>We are extremely excited to announce the imminent launch of <strong>five new journals</strong>, our first new launches in fourteen years. These new journals are unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges and are rooted in the full values of Open Science:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></li></ul>



<p>But, before we go on, let&rsquo;s address this: &ldquo;Yet more journals?&rdquo; (Yes, we heard you&hellip;!)</p>



<p>Yes. We set out, with our original <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/publish/submit/" target="_blank">seven journals</a>, to transform research communication by making research content openly accessible. <a href="https://plos.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Over the eighteen years since our first journal launch</a> we&rsquo;ve helped prove the viability of Open Access which, despite the occasional disagreement about how best to achieve it, is now a mainstream notion. We changed the publishing landscape via <em>PLOS ONE</em>, and this new type of &ldquo;mega-journal&rdquo; now features at almost every publisher and in every research field. We helped focus the conversation about peer review on rigor and transparency, and more people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions. And, via open data policies, open peer review options, protocols, preregistration, preprint facilitation, etc., we&rsquo;ve worked towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the <strong>entire research communication process</strong>, not just our journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All this is to say that we do not take lightly the responsibility of introducing new journals into the world. While we don&rsquo;t believe the long-term future of research communication is always going to be the journal as we know it today, we do appreciate the impacts that journals can still have, and the new <strong>communities of practice </strong>they can empower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are launching these five journals in the spirit of them being additional <strong>change-making vehicles</strong>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve invited key members of the PLOS Leadership Team along with our CEO, Alison Mudditt, to field specific questions, below:&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong><em>&ldquo;Why launch new journals at this point in PLOS&rsquo; journey?&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Niamh O&rsquo;Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a nonprofit, driven by our <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission</a>, and we need to adapt to continue to deliver on it. Even though Open Access is now widely adopted, and Open Science is advancing, there are still key voices missing. We are expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers. Researchers have always driven our mission forward, and in order for us to have a meaningful impact we need to include the broadest range of their voices, globally. This way, we ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. These new journals create new and diverse communities of practice, and ensure that they are at the forefront of shaping how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, all these journals will be underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. Our existing institutional models are our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank">Flat Fee agreement</a> models. We&rsquo;ll talk more about our brand new models when the journals open for submissions, suffice to say that they are also not based on APCs. With all this said, author fee-based models will still be available for those authors who prefer or need them.&rdquo;</p>



<h4><strong><em>&ldquo;What are the special characteristics of these new journals?&rdquo;</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Dan Shanahan, Publishing Director, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>&ldquo;As Niamh says, our next phase of work is not just about Open Access. These new journals not only complement and naturally extend the existing PLOS suite of journals, but will hardwire a lens of social responsibility into sharing research. Via these new journals we can work together to address the most pressing &lsquo;Openness&rsquo; issue specific to each field, and enable the researchers addressing these challenges, everywhere, to have the broadest impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In full alignment with the proposed <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a>, these titles will ensure diversity and equity of representation at all levels &ndash; editors, editorial boards, reviewers, authors &ndash; and will actively seek out research from under-represented communities. The journals will play a part in broader efforts to create a more equitable system of knowledge-sharing, accelerating and increasing the benefits of scientific endeavour for global society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new journals all focus on some of the world&rsquo;s most globally-relevant issues, to which locally-relevant research can, and must, become more visible. This approach will directly challenge the unfortunate norm that most &lsquo;global&rsquo; forums remain dominated by research from Western Europe and North America.&rdquo;</p>



<h4><strong><em>&ldquo;How will these journals contribute to the increased adoption of Open Science practices?&rdquo;</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>&ldquo;PLOS has always led on key Open Science matters, we are experimenters, but we&rsquo;re also striving to be better listeners. We know a rigid approach to Open Science won&rsquo;t foster equitable participation from all communities. As a publisher, we&rsquo;ve never been driven by tradition, but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can understand and improve the system. We&rsquo;ll continue to investigate and test new ways of sharing, assessing, and recognizing research. We&rsquo;ll be partnering with leaders across research communities, and the Open Science communities, to enact change. Not every solution will be journal-shaped, but all our journals will be shaped by Open Science, enabling those who publish with us to join communities of practice. We can use our newly expanded journal portfolio to influence norms and advance Open Science practices in considered and appropriate ways. We stand firm on any policies like open data that promote rigor and advance trust in research, but we want to understand the specific challenges that such policies represent for new communities, and work with them to find solutions that empower them, in their contexts, to practice Open Science. Overall, we want to further empower new communities to join us and inform us, working more tightly together towards ever more trust in science.&rdquo;</p>



<h4><strong><em>&ldquo;How does this expansion of the portfolio fit into PLOS&rsquo; wider aims for the future?&rdquo;</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>&ldquo;PLOS has grown, times have changed, and how we deliver our mission has to evolve. Science is a global, collaborative enterprise. Challenging times help us see where we are and where we need to be. Global collaboration, transparency, and trust in science (and policies&hellip;and interventions&hellip;)&nbsp; have all become recurring themes. We&rsquo;re also coming to terms with how we, as a society, need to do a lot more to address systemic barriers to inclusion. How we think of ourselves as an organization, especially a research communication organization, isn&rsquo;t separate from everything else going on in the world today. We have always worked to raise the bar for Openness. To continue this work we need to continue to grow &ndash; but not just in the traditional business sense, and not just in counting the number of journals we publish: we also need to, and have concrete plans to, spread our roots deeper, create more global hubs for PLOS, absorb researchers&rsquo; local practices more fully into our business, and, as others commented before me, ensure that any journal we publish is informed by local communities at a global scale, challenging problems, and rebuilding the system better.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1GkvF8JqjjU/">The MDAR Framework – a new tool for life sciences reporting</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em><strong>PLOS note:</strong> We are delighted to share this announcement by the MDAR Working Group <strong>(M</strong>aterials, <strong>D</strong>esign, <strong>A</strong>nalysis, <strong>R</strong>eporting)</em> <em>of a new framework for transparent reporting in the life sciences. PLOS has always put emphasis&mdash;through editorial policies and submission guidelines&mdash;on complete and transparent reporting to facilitate the analysis, trust, reproduction and reuse of the research we publish. We&rsquo;ve supported and participated in the MDAR Working Group by sharing our experience and helping to develop and test the new reporting framework. We hope that the MDAR Framework will help bring consistency to journals reporting guidelines and make it easier for authors to adopt transparency norms. The MDAR Framework is consistent with what is practiced at PLOS and we will work with our editorial boards to explore the most effective ways to implement it.</em></p>



<p>Incomplete or imprecise reporting of life sciences research contributes to challenges with reproducibility, replicability, and biomedical applications. For the last three years we &ndash; a group of journal editors and researchers &ndash; have been working together to develop a new framework for transparent reporting of life sciences research. This framework has just been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118">published </a>in <em>PNAS</em>.</p>



<p>The MDAR Framework establishes the four domains &ndash; research Materials, Design, Analysis, and Reporting &ndash; in which we define both a set of basic minimum requirements, and best practice recommendations.</p>



<p>We were motivated to develop the MDAR Framework as part of our own and others&rsquo; attempts to improve reporting to drive research improvement and ultimately greater trust in science. Existing tools, such as the <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines">ARRIVE </a>guidelines, guidance from <a href="https://fairsharing.org/">FAIRSharing</a>, and the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network</a>, speak to important sub-elements of biomedical research. This new MDAR Framework aims to be&nbsp; more general and less deep, and therefore complements these important specialist guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous approaches have led to improved reporting, but often at considerable cost to both authors&rsquo; and editors&rsquo; time. A recent period of experimentation has resulted in a thorough but fragmented landscape of reporting guidelines for life science journals. A drive for efficiency&nbsp; inspired us to learn from each other&rsquo;s experiences and to harmonize the most effective practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MDAR Framework provides flexibility along with broad applicability. The standard articulation of expectations across different journals will make it easier for: (i) authors to better understand what is expected of them, and (ii) for more journals to adopt an established approach rather than develop it from scratch. Journals can choose a level of implementation appropriate to their needs, enabling greater adoption potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also hope that the MDAR Framework will be helpful for other organizations such as funders, who can signal reporting expectations early and therefore have an effect at the time the studies are designed, and tool/software developers, who can devise means of facilitating compliance for authors and journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the framework, the project provides a checklist (for authors, journals or reviewers) as an optional implementation tool, and an explanation and elaboration document. The checklist was piloted on over 289 manuscript submissions across 13 journals, seeking feedback from authors and editors actually using the checklist. Our team analysed agreement between observers, sought feedback from outside experts, and revised the framework in the light of this experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full set of MDAR resources will be maintained and updated as a community resource, in a Collection on the Open Science Framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are sharing this update on the MDAR Framework through coordinated posts on working group member platforms. Working group members have been free to add any additional context as appropriate.</p>

These <a href="https://www.warhol.org/timecapsule/time-capsules/" target="_blank"><i>Time Capsules</i></a> were never sold as art, but they were meticulously cataloged by museum archivists and displayed in a major exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum. “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242174661/dead-bees-nail-clippings-and-priceless-art-in-warhols-time-capsules" target="_blank">Warhol was a packrat</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/26666/accepted">Characterization of an open access medical news platform readership during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                Abstract:  Background:

There now exists many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up-to-date with medical literature. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Objective:

The current study aimed to employ readership and survey data to characterize open access medical news readership trends in relation to COVID-19 in addition to overall readership trends regarding pandemic related information delivery.

Methods:

Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale.

Results:

COVID-19 articles had significantly more median views than non-COVID-19 articles (296 vs. 110, U = 748.5, P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average read times or bounce rate. Non-COVID-19 had more median actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs. 2.5, U = 2070.5, P &lt; 0.05). On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), survey data revealed that 66% (78/119) of readers Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID-19 using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine versus direct journal access. A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (71.7%) than direct journal article access (50.8%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated reading one or less full length medical study following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (16.9% vs. 31.8%, P &lt; 0.05).

Conclusions:

There is a significantly increased readership in one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic, reinforcing that open-access physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers to stay up to date with medical literature.

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology/">The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-warrior-gene-blaming-genetics-for-bad-behavior/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flint_OUPblog_warrior-gene_image-idea-1-744x286.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>The extent to which we can blame our genes for bad behavior took another step backward recently, in the US at least, with a court ruling that data from the “warrior gene” couldn’t be used as an excuse for diminished responsibility.</p><p>Belief in the existence of a warrior gene has been around for more than 25 years, one of many examples where genetic effects on behavior have been misunderstood. In 1994, Stephen Mobley, convicted of murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm, was sentenced to death. His trial occurred soon after the publication of a paper attributing aggression to a deficiency of MAOA. Supporting this claim were data reporting that eight men from the same family had repeated episodes of aggressive behavior. One had been convicted at the age of 23 of the rape of his sister. Another tried to run over his boss with a car at the sheltered workshop where he was employed after having been told that his work was not up to par. A third would enter his sisters&#8217; bedrooms at night, armed with a knife, and force them to undress. At least two more were known arsonists. Han Brunner, the geneticist in the Netherlands who described this unfortunate family, found evidence that males with criminal behavior had a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which is involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, the last being the target of antidepressants such as Prozac. Since men have only one copy of the gene (one X chromosome), the men with the mutation in MAOA had no functional enzyme. On the face of it, MAOA mutations were making Dr Brunner’s patients aggressive. Mobley filed a motion seeking funds to hire expert witnesses to assess whether he, like the men in the paper, had a deficiency of the MAOA gene, which was later to become famous as the “warrior gene.”</p><div><p>It was Mobley’s bad luck that the court threw out his petition, and he was subsequently executed by lethal injection, but news of his defence soon spread. In Ohio in 2000, lawyers for Dion Wayne Sanders tried the MAOA argument, and though the court decided it could not be shown that when Sanders shot both of his grandparents he lacked the specific intent to kill them, the jury returned verdicts of imprisonment rather than the death penalty. And, in a case heard in Tennessee in 2009, with respect to the genetic data, the court found “as a matter of law, that the expert services sought are necessary to ensure that the constitutional rights of the Defendant are properly protected.&#8221; So began a saga that has persisted till February 2021, when the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out the “warrior gene” defence.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and &#8230; arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>However, don’t imagine for a second that this is a death blow for genetic determinism. The court’s decision means that a mutation in a single gene (MAOA) can’t be blamed for violent acts, and since no one has found a mutation in any of the 23,000 other genes in the human genome that causes violence, it’s now pretty certain that there no warrior genes. But there is a possibility that we can blame someone’s genetic constitution in aggregate.</p><p>What’s become clear over the last decade is that almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and that it arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants. These variants are not mutations that kill a gene or give it a new function. In fact, individually, they don’t do much at all, just increasing or decreasing the likelihood of a behavior by a very small amount (if you think of it as percentage where the warrior gene has a 100% effect, then these variants have an effect less than 0.01%). While individually small, there are so many thousands of them that in total the effect is detectable. Scientists have been getting better and better at predicting behavioral outcomes from aggregate assays of genetic data. This is because genetic data is being harvested on an increasingly large scale; it’s routine to publish results from millions of individuals—one of the best and most productive sources of such data comes from the UK where 500,000 people were recruited into the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK BioBank</a>. As datasets grow bigger, the predictive accuracy of genetic data has improved and is being touted in the clinics as a way to diagnose heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other common diseases. It won’t be long before lawyers realize they have a new toy: “don’t blame my client, he couldn’t help himself, it was all in his genes.”</p></div><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649872592/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f04%2fFlint_OUPblog_warrior-gene_image-idea-1-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649872592/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper &quot;Bursting Neurons Signal Input Slope&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common
firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they
represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to
determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features
of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells
indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial
arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal
dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a
computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to
investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that
trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives
sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially
on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the
number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a
graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in
terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are
several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur
preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et
al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a
simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our
observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst
duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This
possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for
correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.</p>

<html><body><p>You&rsquo;ve painstakingly mapped out your research goal: to answer that unanswered question. You&rsquo;ve conducted your experiments, analyzed the results and written your paper. Now it&rsquo;s off to a journal. And the process begins. PLOS editors have seen it all and want to help get your paper published as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>What does the journal office look for, and what are the potential pitfalls? More importantly, how can you ensure that your manuscript passes journal checks and moves on to peer review quickly? Here, PLOS staff discuss a few of the most common reasons why a manuscript is rejected during the initial technical check, and how to avoid them.</p>



<p>For a bit of background, after a manuscript is submitted to a scientific journal it undergoes a series of technical and ethical checks. Submissions that pass this initial screening go on to editorial assessment and peer review. Submissions that don&rsquo;t meet requirements, or don&rsquo;t provide enough information, may be returned to the authors for clarification. This can extend review times and even lead to a manuscript being rejected without review. Below are 5 checks and tips on how to smoothly get past them.</p>



<p><strong>Check #1: Sense check</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, does the manuscript make sense as a submission? Is it a scientific article? Are all the typical parts of an article (abstract, introduction, methods, results/discussion, figures citations) all present? Is the language clear and understandable?</p>



<p><strong>How to pass it: </strong>Make sure that your manuscript is complete, and that the writing is clear and unambiguous. Note that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect at this stage, just precise enough for fellow researchers in your field to understand and evaluate your work.</p>

          <p>Journals tend to specialize in particular subjects and types of studies. &ldquo;The biggest reason we reject without review is scope.&rdquo; Explains Kendall McKenzie, Managing Editor of <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope"> &ldquo;</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope">Our scope page</a> breaks down the diseases and categories of research we&rsquo;re interested in, and even specifically states the kinds of things we don&rsquo;t consider.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> It comes down to submitting the right manuscript to the right publication. Carefully investigate the journal&rsquo;s scope before submitting to ensure that your manuscript has a good chance of publication. If your particular article is on the edge of the journal&rsquo;s expressed scope, or if you&rsquo;re just not sure, search the journal for similar articles; if there are no comparable publications, your study is likely out of scope.</p>

<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> This one is all about doing your research. Different journals have different criteria for publication. Consult the journal website and consider whether your study fulfills the requirements and mission of the journal. Does the journal publish the type of research your study describes? Will your article appeal to the readers the journal serves? If not, consider a more specialized publication that focuses specifically on the type of research you are conducting, or, alternatively, a journal with a broader, more inclusive scope.</p>



<p><strong>Check #4: Plagiarism</strong></p>

          <p>Most journals run an automated check that looks for similarities between your manuscript and previously published works. If the manuscript scores above a certain threshold, members of the journal staff will take a closer look at your manuscript to ensure that any direct quotes are framed within quotation marks and properly cited. &ldquo;Overall the most common issue we see is authors reusing their own methods section, introduction, or conclusion from previous or related studies,&rdquo; explains <em>PLOS ONE</em> Publishing Editor Emma Stillings. Authors don&rsquo;t always realize that &ldquo;you have to cite everyone, even yourself, to avoid any delay in the peer review process.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> Any direct quotes <em>must </em>be framed within quotation marks and properly attributed. That includes your own prior works. Try to avoid reusing text, and especially copy-pasting from your other papers. Check to make sure that any summaries or allusions are properly cited as well.</p>



<p><strong>Check #5: Complete and consistent ethical, funding, data, and other statements</strong></p>



<p>If the statements in the submission form are unclear, lacking detail, or otherwise incomplete, the process will pause while the journal office contacts the authors for more information. Similarly, if the statements within the manuscript are different from those in the submission system, the journal office will work with the authors to reconcile them before the manuscript can advance.</p>



<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> Label and save the paperwork from the early part of your research process: funding information, committee approval documents, permits, permission forms, patient disclosure statements, study designs, and any other materials. You may need them to complete your submission form. When you are ready to submit, proofread carefully to ensure that everything in your manuscript is up-to-date and clear. Double check to make sure that any placeholder text has been replaced with the final version.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Image-744x286.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Serial killers—people who repeatedly murder others—provoke revulsion but also a certain amount of fascination in the general public. But what can modern psychology and neuroscience tell us about what might be going on inside the head of such individuals?</p><p>Serial killers characteristically lack empathy for others, coupled with an apparent absence of guilt about their actions. At the same time, many can be superficially charming, allowing them to lure potential victims into their web of destruction. One explanation for such cognitive dissonance is that serial killers are individuals in whom two minds co-exist—one a rational self, able to successfully navigate the intricacies of acceptable social behaviour and even charm and seduce, the other a far more sinister self, capable of the most unspeakable and violent acts against others. This view has been a powerful stimulus in fictional portrayals ranging from <em>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>, to Hitchcock’s <em>Psycho</em>, and a more recent film, <em>Split</em>. Yet there is little evidence that real-life serial killers suffer from dissociative identity disorder (DID), in which an individual has two or more personalities cohabiting in their mind, apparently unaware of each other.</p><p>Instead, DID is a condition more associated with victims, rather than perpetrators, of abuse, who adopt multiple personalities as a way of coming to terms with the horrors they have encountered. Of course a perpetrator of abuse may also be a victim, and many serial killers were abused as children, but in general they appear not to be split personalities, but rather people conscious of their acts. Despite this, there is surely a dichotomy in the minds of such individuals perhaps best personified by US killer Ted Bundy, who was a “charming, handsome, successful individual [yet also] a sadist, necrophile, rapist, and murderer with zero remorse who took pride in his ability to successfully kill and evade capture.”</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;a recent brain imaging study &#8230; showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between &#8230; a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>One puzzling aspect of serial killers’ minds is the fact that they appear to lack—or can override—the emotional responses that in other people allows us to identify the pain and suffering of other humans as similar to our own, and empathise with that suffering. A possible explanation of this deficit was identified in a recent brain imaging study. This showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between the amygdala—a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions—and the prefrontal cortex, which interprets responses from the amygdala. When connectivity between these two regions is low, processing of negative stimuli in the amygdala does not translate into any strongly felt negative emotions. This may explain why criminal psychopaths do not feel guilty about their actions, or sad when their victims suffer.</p><p>Yet serial killers also seem to possess an enhanced emotional drive that leads to an urge to hurt and kill other human beings. This apparent contradiction in emotional responses still needs to be explained at a neurological level. At the same time, we should not ignore social influences as important factors in the development of such contradictory impulses. It seems possible that serial killers have somehow learned to view their victims as purely an object to be abused, or even an assembly of unconnected parts. This might explain why some killers have sex with dead victims, or even turn their bodies into objects of utility or decoration, but it does not explain why they seem so driven to hurt and kill their victims. One explanation for the latter phenomenon is that many serial killers are insecure individuals who feel compelled to kill due to a morbid fear of rejection. In many cases, the fear of rejection seems to result from having been abandoned or abused by a parent. Such fear may compel a fledgling serial killer to want to eliminate any objects of their affections. They may come to believe that by destroying the person they desire, they can eliminate the possibility of being abandoned, humiliated, or otherwise hurt, as they were in childhood.</p><p>Serial killers also appear to lack a sense of social conscience. Through our parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and other individuals who influence us as we grow up, we learn to distinguish right from wrong. It is this that inhibits us from engaging in anti-social behaviour. Yet serial killers seem to feel they are exempt from the most important social sanction of all—not taking another person’s life. For instance, Richard Ramirez, named the “Night Stalker” by the media, claimed at his trial that <em>“you don&#8217;t understand me. You are not expected to. You are not capable of it. I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil … I don&#8217;t believe in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this so-called civilized society.” </em></p><p>It remains far from clear why a few people react to abuse or trauma at an earlier stage in their lives by later becoming a serial killer. But hopefully new insights into the psychological or neurological basis of their actions may in the future help us to identify potential future such killers and dissuade them from committing such horrendous crimes.</p><p><em>Featured image via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/vectors/psycho-shower-stabbing-knife-kill-303435/">Pixabay</a></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649494254/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649494254/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2fCover-Image-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649494254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/beyond-history-and-identity-what-else-can-we-learn-from-the-past/">Beyond history and identity: what else can we learn from the past?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>Early convolutional neural net (CNNs) architectures like the Neocognitron, LeNet and HMAX were inspired by the brain. But how much like the brain are modern CNNs? I made a pretty strong claim on Twitter a few weeks ago that the early visual processing is nothing like a CNN:</p>

<p>In typical Twitter fashion, my statement was a little over-the-top, and it deserved a takedown. What followed was a long thread of replies from Blake Richards, Grace Lindsay, Dileep George, Simon Kornblith, members of Jim DiCarlo&#8217;s lab, and even Yann LeCun. The different perspectives are interesting, and I&#8217;m curating them here. </p>



<p>My position, in brief, is that weight sharing and feature maps &#8211; the defining characteristics of modern CNNs &#8211; are crude approximations of the topography of the early visual cortex and its localized connection structure. Whether this distinction matters in practice depends on what you want your models to accomplish &#8211; I argue that for naturalistic vision, it can matter a lot. </p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>There are several defining characteristics of modern CNNs:</p>



<ul><li>Hierarchical processing</li><li>Selectivity operations (i.e the ReLU)</li><li>Pooling operations</li><li>Localized receptive fields</li><li>Feature maps</li><li>Weight sharing</li></ul>



<p>Where did these ideas come from?</p>



<p>Hubel and Wiesel (1962) described simple and complex cells in the cat primary visual cortex. Simple cells respond best to a correctly oriented bar or edge. Complex cells, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the sign of the contrast of the bar or edge, or its exact location. They hypothesized that simple cells are generated by aggregating the correct LGN afferents selective for light and dark spots, followed by the threshold nonlinearity of the cells. Complex cells were hypothesized to be generated by pooling from similarly tuned simple cells. They later expanded these ideas: perhaps first-order and second-order hypercomplex cells are created by the repetition of the same pattern. Thus, hierarchy, selectivity, pooling and localized receptive fields were all hypothesized to be taking place.</p>

<p>Fukushima (1980) adapted many of these ideas in a self-organized hierarchical neural network called the Neocognitron. In the S-layers, neurons weight the input from previous layers via localized receptive fields, followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. In C-layers, inputs from the previous are pooled linearly, followed by a sigmoid. </p>

<p>The Neocognitron also introduces what may be <em>the</em> defining features of modern CNNs: parallel feature maps (here called planes) and weight sharing. This is most clearly seen in the selectivity operation for S-layers, which is a convolution over the set of local coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_l&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=3a3a3a&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_l" class="latex" />, followed by a ReLU:</p>

<p>The reason behind the introduction of parallel feature maps and weight sharing is not very clear in the original paper, and in fact in section 3 the paper casts doubt on how realistic these assumptions are as a model of vision:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One of the basic hypotheses employed in the neocognitron is the assumption that all the S-cells in the same S-plane have input synapses of the same spatial distribution, and that only the positions of the presynaptic cells shift in parallel in accordance with the shift in position of individual S-cell&#8217;s receptive fields. It is not known whether modifiable synapses in the real nervous system are actually self-organized always keeping such conditions. Even if it is assumed to be true, neither do we know by what mechanism such a self-organization goes on. </p></blockquote>



<p>So why introduce these features at all?</p>



<h2>Topography conquers all</h2>



<p>Fukushima however links localized receptive fields with the idea of localized topography:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[&#8230;] orderly synaptic connections are formed between retina and optic tectum not only in the development in the embryo but also in regeneration in the adult amphibian or fish</p></blockquote>



<p>This is one of the enduring facts of visual neuroscience: inputs from the retina are preserved topologically as they make their way to the LGN, V1, and onwards to extrastriate cortex. Visual angle and log radius are mapped from the retina to V1 in development, guided by chemical gradients. The progression of the maps reverse as we go up the visual hierarchy (in fact, areas are defined by this very reversal in direction). What&#8217;s remarkable is how precise the topography is: Hubel and Wiesel estimated that in primary visual cortex, neighbouring cells varied in receptive field center by less than half a receptive field.</p>



<div data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":3084329,"permalink":"https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/"}' class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://journals.physiology.org/cms/10.1152/jn.01202.2003/asset/images/large/z9k0070439721001.jpeg" alt="FIG. 1." width="-305" height="-587" /><figcaption>From Ringach (2004)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There&#8217;s another fact of life in cortex, which is that horizontal wiring is expensive. If a neuron integrates from localized inputs, and those inputs are retinotopically organized, that neuron will have a localized receptive field. If you assume that the synaptic pattern is localized and random then for every cell, there must be other similarly tuned cells somewhere else in the visual field. My postdoc advisor Dario <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01202.2003">Ringach introduced a model (2004)</a> for how simple cells in primary visual cortex can occur from such sparse localized connections.</p>



<p>That covers feature maps. However, if the input statistics to primary visual cortex are stationary, then a self-supervised criterion could refine a randomly initialized V1 feature map, effectively letting the input do the weight tying &#8211; a subtle point brought up by Blake Richards.</p>



<h2>Non-stationarities at the large scale</h2>



<p>I hope to have convinced you that the link between CNNs, first introduced by Fukushima, and early visual processing in the brain is quite subtle. Whether a CNN is a good or a bad model of early visual processing depends on what phenomenon we care to model. If we&#8217;re talking about core visual recognition in the parafovea &#8211; which is what the majority of the quantification comes from &#8211; the match is quite good. At larger spatial scales, however, I would argue that the match is compromised by two facts.</p>



<p>First, spatial resolution is not constant as a function of space. A CNN on a Cartesian grid doesn&#8217;t scale with eccentricity. This issue has received some attention lately, and foveating CNNs are starting to be considered &#8211; see <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=2_Z6MECjPEa">this recent paper from Arturo Deza and Talia Konkle for example</a>.</p>



<div data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":3084329,"permalink":"https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/"}' class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/26196"><img src="https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/26196%2Felife-26196-fig9-v1.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="211" /></a><figcaption>Spatial frequency tuning correlates with spatial tuning. From Arcaro and Livingstone (2017)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Secondly, the eyes foveate towards interesting targets &#8211; e.g. faces &#8211; which mean that statistics are highly nonstationary different as a function of space. The ground looks very different from the sky. Hands tend to be in the lower half of the visual field, and numerous visual areas have only partial maps of the visual field. There&#8217;s overrepresentation of radial orientations, more curvature selectivity in the fovea, no blue cones in the fovea, etc. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a picture to illustrate this. If VGG19 is a good model of primary visual visual cortex, then it follows that maximizing predicted activity in primary visual cortex could be done by maximizing an unweighted sum of VGG19 subunits, a la DeepDream. If you do that for layer 7 of VGG19, you get the picture on the left. However, we can use fMRI to estimate a matrix, via ridge regression that maps VGG19 to an fMRI subspace, and then optimize a weighted sum of VGG19 subunits, giving us the picture on the right. This image highlights some of the known spatial biases in primary visual cortex &#8211; shifts in prefered spatial frequency as a function of eccentricity, radial bias, curvature bias in the fovea &#8211; which are not apparent in an unweighted VGG19. So at the very least, the brain&#8217;s image manifold is rotated and rescaled compared to the VGG19 image manifold.</p>

<p>Margaret Livingstone has a very interesting line of research (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_YTcec9Z0">talk here</a>) highlighting the close link between spatial biases and the development of object and face recognition modules in high-level visual cortex. More generally, if we&#8217;re interested in how vision is organized for action &#8211; ecological vision in the tradition of Gibson &#8211; then whether a network has captured, e.g. the fact that the bottom half of the visual field has very different affordances than the top half matters. If you applied a unsupervised criterion to learn features from natural images without weight sharing, those features would vary quite a bit across space &#8211; unlike in a CNN. This point was also raised by Dileep George.</p>



<h2>Weight sharing is not strictly necessary</h2>



<p>LeCun (1989) demonstrates the use of backpropagation to train a convolutional image recognition network. There&#8217;s a beautiful figure that highlights the effect of adding more and more constraints, in particular in going from a fully-connected 2-layer network (net2) to a high-capacity convolutional neural net (net5):</p>



<div data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":3084329,"permalink":"https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/"}' class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="7584" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-8/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png" data-orig-size="1496,1026" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=723" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7584" width="476" height="326" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=476 476w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=952 952w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></a><figcaption>From LeCun (1989)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>LeCun (1989) clarifies that weight sharing is a clever trick that decreases the number of weights to be learned, which in the small data limit is practically important to obtain good test set accuracy. We are a long ways from 1989 in terms of dataset size, and unsupervised learning could learn untied feature maps, as pointed out by Yann LeCun in the Twitter thread. But would currently existing benchmarks favor ANNs-with-local-receptive-field-but-untied-weights?</p>



<h2>The leaderboard is the message</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s turn back to the claim that early visual cortex is like a particular CNN. As Wu, David and Gallant (2006) put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>an important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience [is] developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.brain-score.org/">Brain-Score</a> is an embodiment of this idea &#8211; benchmark, across many different datasets and ventral stream areas, the ability of many different CNNs to explain brain activity. The leaderboard is pretty clear that the VGG19 architecture outperform alternatives in explaining average firing rate &#8211; even when these alternatives are better at classifying images in ImageNet. That&#8217;s an interesting finding &#8211; VGG19 is shallower and has larger receptive fields than more modern CNNs, so perhaps its performance on this benchmark is because of that.</p>



<p>Grace Lindsay pointed out that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[&#8230;] when the results were first coming out that trained convolutional neural networks are good predictors of activity in the visual system some people had the attitude of &#8220;that&#8217;s not interesting because obviously anything that does vision well will look like the brain&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that we now have architectures that solve object recognition which are very different from CNNs, namely visual transformers (ViT). They are architecturally different from brains, and they while they perform well on ImageNet, they underperform in predicting single neuron responses. So now we have a clear example of a disconnect between ImageNet performance and similarity to the brain, and that strengthens the claim that core object recognition is like a CNN.</p>



<p>So on the one hand, the data from BrainScore says that CNNs are the best models of core object recognition, yet there are pretty stark ways in which early visual processing is unlike a CNN, some of which I&#8217;ve mentioned already, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07092">others which have been highlighted in Grace Lindsay&#8217;s excellent review</a>. </p>



<p>Would Brain-Score, in theory, rate better a model which respects the distinction between excitation and inhibition (Dale&#8217;s law)? That seems unlikely, since there are no cell type annotations in the datasets. Would it rate better a foveated model, or one that doesn&#8217;t have weight sharing? Again, unlikely, since as Tiago Marques points out, for technical reasons, most datasets are taken in the parafovea. In any case, the metric used to score the models is rotation invariant, so it wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell these cases apart. As Simon Kornblith points out, choices of metrics are not falsifiable. The right approach for choosing metrics is the axiomatic one, as demonstrated in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414">Simon&#8217;s CKA paper</a>: the modeller or the community decides what the right metric is based off of design criterias that represent what they think is interesting about the data.</p>



<p>Does that mean we should ignore Brain-Score? No! I really like Brain-Score &#8211; I wish there were many more Brain-Score-like leaderboards! Comparing on lots of datasets prevents cherry picking &#8211; there is <a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/">robustness in the meta-analytic approach</a>. What I&#8217;m excited about is the possibility of Brain-Scores &#8211; a constellation of leaderboards that benchmark different models according to rules which match on modeler&#8217;s interests. I&#8217;ve been involved in proto-community-benchmark efforts like the neural prediction challenge and spikefinder before, and the technological barriers to run such a leaderboard have been lowered by commoditized cloud infra. The value proposition is also becoming clearer, and I am excited to see <a href="https://neurallatents.github.io/">more of these efforts pop up</a>.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Organization of Cell Assemblies in the Hippocampus&quot; and will briefly
presnt how this subject can be approached with topological data analysis.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A
fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in
information processing. According to the &quot;cell assembly&quot; hypothesis,
transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons
underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal
cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be
arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common
modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of
hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using
the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the
animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial
prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase
modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted
from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30,ms, suggesting
that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this
temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal
neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time
window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity
at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage
in cortical circuits.</p>

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and with it, normal life of eating out, commuting to work, and seeing grandparents came to a sudden halt. One year later, my new book about the intersection of psychology and the workplace was published. With wide-scale vaccinations on the rise, I thought it would be a good time to take stock of where we are and just how much has changed.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, major shifts in how employees think about and interact with their workplace were well underway. Routine tasks were increasingly handed over to automation, such that workers could concentrate on more complex or valuable activities. Employees were being shuffled into new environments guided by activity-based working, with neighborhoods and open-plan floor plans replacing traditional cubicles. Gig working was on the rise and self-employed side hustles were becoming the norm.</p><p>COVID-19 added fuel to the fire. During the pandemic’s peak, approximately 30% of employees were working from home, while internet use surged by up to 30% of pre-pandemic levels, as workers competed for bandwidth with their kids who were now thrown into distance learning. Social collaboration tools, like Zoom and Teams, found the footing that they were searching for and quickly became the default means of working with peers and customers.</p><p>Even though employers made swift and effective adjustments, the pandemic unearthed social inequalities that were bubbling under the surface. Whereas over half of information workers in the US (e.g. consultants or managers) had the luxury to stay safe by working from home, only 1 in 20 service workers could do the same. These workers were tied to their physical workplace, making cars, cooking food, or cleaning hospitals, and often represented people of color. They bore the brunt of the sudden lockdown in normal life, having to both put themselves at risk and be left without the tools to work in any other way.</p><p>With sustainable progress towards an end to the pandemic in sight, employers have already made decisions that will have lasting effects on the workplace. Remote working has proven both feasible and effective for even the most skeptical companies, resulting in many employers encouraging hybrid working. Exactly what this means is still up in the air, even for Big Technology. Twitter and Spotify have vowed to make remote working indefinite, while Google requires employees who plan to spend more than 14 days at home annually to apply for special permission. Somewhere in between are Facebook, Salesforce, and Amazon who have all stated support for a hybrid model.</p><p>The offices that employees are returning to will also look and feel different. This past year has given employers the rare opportunity to reassess their real estate portfolio. For example, companies like Target have recently announced a reduction of their office footprint, anticipating lower utilization due to hybrid working. When they do come in, workers will be there to collaborate with peers, access tools and technology, or simply meet up as a team. What is increasingly off the menu is the solitary, heads-down type of work that was typically done in a cubicle.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>To date, much of the shift to the Future of Work has been unidimensional, by tackling the physical workplace. What lags behind is a new set of behaviors and social norms that will help guide employees about how and when they should interact with their new workplace.</p><p>For example, video conferencing breaks down the separation between home and work life. Catching a glimpse of a curious four-year-old popping up on screen or spotting laundry that has yet to be put away creates unintended and possibly inappropriate intimacy. Whereas, choices about when to turn on the camera and what hours are truly off-limits have yet to fully work themselves out.</p><p>Just like the tangible office, effective remote working will be made possible by a range of behaviors and social norms that interplay with the motivations, needs, and desires of employees. Wearing a suit while on camera not only looks odd, but plays against our desire for being comfortable at home. There is a competing interest between looking professional and feeling comfortable, with the answer resting somewhere between formalwear and pajamas.</p><p>As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment. Drivers like identity, reward, and obedience are all still in play, but will take on a distinct flavor as we migrate to a new way of working. Building rapport on Zoom is different than sitting down for a meal, just like observing job performance in person benefits from a degree of constant visibility that will go missing with remote work. Following the pandemic, there is little doubt that the workplace will fundamentally change; the question is how and when the psychology of workers will catch up.</p><h5>Read a free chapter on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190061241.001.0001/oso-9780190061241-chapter-2?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=social%20media&amp;utm_campaign=oupac-campaign%3A1359185357522304002">&#8220;Connection&#8221; from<em> Punching the Clock</em></a>, freely available until 13 May 2021.</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/piranka?mediatype=photography">piranka</a></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649110286/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649110286/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f04%2fUngemah-iStock-blog-image-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649110286/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about Clubhouse yet&#8230; well, it&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolis/2021/01/26/the-latest-silicon-valley-unicorn-clubhouse-raises-100-million-and-also-raises-attention-to-the-importance-of-audio-based-social-networking/?sh=581771e823a6" target="_blank">the latest Silicon Valley unicorn</a>, and <em>the</em> popular new chat hole for thought leaders. I heard about it for the first time a few months ago, and was kindly offered an invitation (Club house is invitation only!) so I could explore what it is all about. Clubhouse is an app for audio based social networking, and the content is, as far as I can tell, a mixed bag. I&#8217;ve listened to a handful of conversations hosted on the app.. topics include everything from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.coindesk.com/everyone-wants-invite-clubhouse-crypto" target="_blank">bitcoin</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/01/26/forget-about-san-francisco-and-silicon-valley-miami-is-planning-on-being-the-next-great-tech-hub/?sh=7aceb2ea466e" target="_blank">Miami</a>. It was interesting, at times, to hear the thoughts and opinions of some of the discussants. On the other hand, there is a lot of superficial rambling on Clubhouse as well. During a conversation about genetics I heard someone posit that biology has a lot to learn from the fashion industry. This was delivered in a &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZBKX-6Gz6A" target="_blank">you are hearing something profound</a>&#8221; manner, by someone who clearly knew nothing about either biology or the fashion industry, which is really too bad, because the fashion industry is quite interesting and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all if biology has something to learn from it. Unfortunately, I never learned what that is. </p>



<p>One of the regulars on Clubhouse is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/" target="_blank">Noor Siddiqui</a>. You may not have heard of her; in fact she is officially &#8220;not notable&#8221;. That is to say, she used to have a Wikipedia page but it was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Noor_Siddiqui" target="_blank">deleted on the grounds that there is nothing about her that indicates notability</a>, which is of course notable in and of itself&#8230; a paradox that says more about Wikipedia&#8217;s gatekeeping than Siddiqui (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics" target="_blank">Russell 1903</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1380003729445896194?s=20" target="_blank">Litt 2021</a>). In any case, Siddiqui was recently part of a Clubhouse conversation on &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ios.joinclubhouse.com/event/PD4qybXo" target="_blank">convergence of genomics and reproductive technology</a>&#8221; together with Carlos Bustamante (advisor to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/luna-dna-will-give-bitcoins-genomic-data/" target="_blank">cryptocurrency based Luna DNA</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/cdbustamante/status/1380991720431742978?s=20" target="_blank">soon to be professor of business technology</a> at the University of Miami) and Balaji Srinivasan (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/" target="_blank">bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur</a>). As it happens, Siddiqui is the CEO of a startup called &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/" target="_blank">Orchid Health</a>&#8220;, in the genomics and reproductive technology &#8220;space&#8221;. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html" target="_blank">The company promises</a> to harness &#8220;population genetics, statistical modeling, reproductive technologies, and the latest advances in genomic science&#8221; to &#8220;give parents the option to lower a future child&#8217;s genetic risk by creating embryos through in IVF and implanting embryos in the order that can reduce disease risk.&#8221; This &#8220;product&#8221; will be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/" target="_blank">available later this year</a>. Bustamante and Srinivasan are early &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/announcing-orchid" target="_blank">operators and investors</a>&#8221; in the venture. </p>



<p>Orchid is not Siddiqui&#8217;s first startup. While she doesn&#8217;t have a Wikipedia page, she does have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/" target="_blank">website</a> where she boasts of having (briefly) been a Thiel fellow and, together with her sister, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/14126/20140827/google-glass-has-a-place-in-the-medical-industry-with-a-new-app.htm" target="_blank">starting a company</a> as a teenager. The idea of the (briefly in existence) startup was apparently to help the now commercially defunct <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://screenrant.com/google-glass-smart-glasses-what-happened-explained/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a> gain acceptance by bringing the device to the medical industry. According to Siddiqui, Orchid is also not her first dive into statistical modeling or genomics. She notes on her website that she did &#8220;AI and genomics research&#8221;, specifically on &#8220;deep learning for genomics&#8221;. Such training and experience could have been put to good use but&#8230;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Polygenic risk scores and polygenic embryo selection</strong></strong></p>



<p>Orchid Health claims that it will &#8220;safely and naturally, protect your baby from diseases that run in your family&#8221; (the slogan &#8220;have healthy babies&#8221; is prominently displayed on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/" target="_blank">company&#8217;s website</a>). The way it will do this is to utilize &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/orchid-blooms-with-4-5m-seed-for-preconception-test-to-determine-genetic-risks/" target="_blank">advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence</a>&#8221; to screen embryos created through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) for &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/embryo" target="_blank">breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer&#8217;s</a>&#8220;. What this means in (a statistical geneticist&#8217;s) layman&#8217;s terms is that <strong>Orchid is planning to use polygenic risk scores derived from genome-wide association studies to perform polygenic embryo selection for complex diseases</strong>. This can be easily unpacked because it&#8217;s quite a simple proposition, although it&#8217;s far from a trivial one- the statistical genetics involved is deep and complicated.</p>



<p>First, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder" target="_blank">single-gene disorder</a> is a health problem that is caused by a single mutation in the genome. Examples of such disorders include Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia, Huntington&#8217;s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and many other diseases. A &#8220;complex disease&#8221;, also called a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifactorial_diseases" target="_blank">multifactorial disease</a>, is a disease that has a genetic component, but one that involves multiple genes, i.e. it is<em> </em>not a single-gene disorder. Crucially, complex diseases may involve effects of environmental factors, whose role in causing disease may depend on the genetic composition of an individual. The list of diseases on Orchid&#8217;s website, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease are all examples of complex (multifactorial) diseases.</p>



<p>To identify genes that <em>associate </em>with a complex disease, researchers perform <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study" target="_blank">genome-wide association studies</a> (GWAS). In such studies, researchers typically analyze several million genomic sites in a large numbers of individuals with and without a disease (used to be thousands of individuals, nowadays hundreds of thousands or millions) and perform regressions to assess the marginal effect at each locus. I italicized the word associate above, because genome-wide association studies do not, in and of themselves, point to genomic loci that cause disease. Rather, they produce, as output, lists of genomic loci that have varying degrees of association with the disease or trait of interest. </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score" target="_blank">Polygenic risk scores</a> (PRS), which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/broadinstitute/status/1354804918264098817?s=20" target="_blank">the Broad Institute claims to have discovered</a> (narrator: they were not discovered at the Broad Institute), are a way to combine the multiple genetic loci associated with a complex disease from a GWAS. Specifically, a PRS <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;hat{S}" class="latex" /> for a complex disease is given by</p>

<p>where the sum is over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> different genetic loci, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_j" class="latex" /> are coded genetic markers for an individual at the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> loci, and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_j" class="latex" /> are weights based on the marginal effects derived from a GWAS.  The concept of a PRS is straightforward, but the details are complicated, in some cases subtle, and generally non-trivial. There is debate over how many genomic loci should be used in computing a polygenic risk score given that the vast majority of marginal effects are very close to zero (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/28/R2/R143/5555564" target="_blank">Janssens 2019</a>), lots of ongoing research about how to set the weights to account for issues such as bias caused by<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium" target="_blank"> linkage disequilibrium</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001" target="_blank">Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22050" target="_blank">Shin et al. 2017</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22245" target="_blank">Newcombe et al. 2019</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09718-5" target="_blank">Ge et al. 2019</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12653-0" target="_blank">Lloyd-Jones et al. 2019</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271" target="_blank">Pattee and Pan 2020</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271#" target="_blank">Song et al. 2020</a>), and continuing discussions about the ethics of using polygenic risk scores in the clinic (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00829-7" target="_blank">Lewis and Green 2021</a>). </p>



<p>While much of the discussion around PRS applications centers on applications such as determining diagnostic testing frequency (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5" target="_blank">Wald and Old 2019</a>),  polygenic embryo selection (PES) posits that polygenic risk scores should be taken a step further and evaluated for embryos to be used as a basis for discarding, or selecting, specific embryos for in vitro fertilization implantation. The idea has been widely criticized and critiqued (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31210-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419312103%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank">Karavani et al. 2019</a>). It has been described as unethical, morally repugnant, and concerns about its use for eugenics have been voiced by many. Underlying these criticisms is the fact that the technical issues with PES using PRS are manifold.</p>



<p><strong>Poor penetrance</strong></p>



<p>The term &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance" target="_blank">penetrance</a>&#8221; for a disease refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genetic variant that have the disease. Many single-gene disorders have very high penetrance. For example, F508del mutation in the CFTR gene is 100% penetrant for cystic fibrosis. That is, 100% of people who are homozygous for this variant, meaning that both copies of their DNA have a deletion of the phenylalanine amino acid in position 508 of their CFTR gene, will have cystic fibrosis. The vast majority of variants associated with complex diseases have very low penetrance. For example, in schizophrenia, the penetrance of &#8220;high risk&#8221; <em>de novo</em> copy number variants (in which there are variable copies of DNA at a genomic loci) was found to be between 2% and 7.4% (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/17/3477/677022" target="_blank">Vassos et al 2010</a>). The low penetrance at large numbers of variants for complex diseases was precisely the rationale for developing polygenic risk scores in the first place, the idea being that while individual variants yield small effects, perhaps in (linear) combination they can have more predictive power. While it is true that combining variants does yield more predictive power for complex diseases, unfortunately the accuracy is, in absolute terms, very low. </p>



<p>The reason for low predictive power of PRS is explained well in (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5" target="_blank">Wald and Old 2020</a>) and is illustrated for coronary artery disease (CAD) in (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073510972035155X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Rotter and Lin 2020</a>):</p>

<p>The issue is that while the polygenic risk score distribution may indeed be shifted for individuals with a disease, and while this shift may be statistically significant resulting in large odds ratios, i.e. much higher <em>relative</em> risk for individuals with higher PRS, the proportion of individuals in the tail of the distributions who will or won&#8217;t develop the disease will greatly affect the predictive power of the PRS. For example, Wald and Old note that PRS for CAD from (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z" target="_blank">Khera et al. 2018</a>) will confer a detection rate of only 15% with a false positive rate of 5%. At a 3% false positive rate the detection rate would be only 10%. This is visible in the figure above, where it is clear that control of the false positive right (i.e. thresholding at the extreme right-hand side with high PRS score) will filter out many (most) affected individuals. The same issue is raised in the excellent review on PES of (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01019-3" target="_blank">Lázaro-Muńoz et al. 2020</a>). The authors explain that &#8220;even if a PRS in the top decile for schizophrenia conferred a nearly fivefold increased risk for a given embryo, this would still yield a &gt;95% chance of not developing the disorder.&#8221; It is worth noting in this context, that diseases like schizophrenia are not even well defined phenotypically (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120305047?casa_token=gKO_3q8Fr5gAAAAA:cvtDCj7tY2Pj6ZFcpLS3KgGN0MnnNlxcgU5rsL0P-DhIOdYQD6wIU2GBAWFuT6Ou51njyLqs_A" target="_blank">Mølstrøm et al. 2020</a>), which is another complex matter that is too involved to go into detail here.</p>



<p>In a recent tweet, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834" target="_blank">Siddiqui describes natural conception as a genetic lottery</a>, and suggests that Orchid Health, by performing PES, can tilt the odds in customers&#8217; favor. To do so the false positive rate must be low, or else too many embryos will be discarded. But a 15% sensitivity is highly problematic considering the risks inherent with IVF in the first place (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g252" target="_blank">Kamphuis et al. 2014</a>): </p>

<p>To be concrete, an odds ratio of 2.8 for cerebral palsy needs to be balanced against the fact that in the Khera et al. study, only 8% of individuals had an odds ratio &gt;3.0 for CAD. Other diseases are even worse, in this sense, than CAD. In atrial fibrillation (one of the diseases on Orchid Health&#8217;s list), only 9.3% of the individuals in the top 0.44% of the atrial fibrillation PRS actually had atrial fibrillation (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315686" target="_blank">Choi et al 2019</a>).As one starts to think carefully about the practical aspects and tradeoffs in performing PES, other issues, resulting from the low penetrance of complex disease variants, come into play as well. (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370478v2.full" target="_blank">Lencz et al. 2020</a>) examine these tradeoffs in detail, and conclude that &#8220;the differential performance of PES across selection strategies and risk reduction metrics may be difficult to communicate to couples seeking assisted reproductive technologies&#8230; These difficulties are expected to exacerbate the already profound ethical issues raised by PES&#8230; which include stigmatization, autonomy (including “choice overload”, and equity. In addition, the ever-present specter of eugenics may be especially salient in the context of the LRP (lowest-risk prioritization) strategy.&#8221; They go on to &#8220;call for urgent deliberations amongst key stakeholders (including researchers, clinicians, and patients) to address governance of PES and for the development of policy statements by professional societies.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Pleiotropy</strong> <strong>predicaments</strong></p>



<p>I remember a conversation I had with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F2LPg4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Nicolas Bray</a> several years ago shortly after the exciting discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing, on the implications of the technology for improving human health. Nick pointed out that the development of genomics had been curiously &#8220;backwards&#8221;. Thirty years ago, when human genome sequencing was beginning in earnest, the hope was that with the sequence at hand we would be able to start figuring out the function of genes, and even individual base pairs in the genome. At the time, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.mit.edu/1992/genome-1209" target="_blank">the human genome project was billed as</a> being able to &#8220;help scientists search for genes associated with human disease&#8221; and it was imagined that &#8220;greater understanding of the genetic errors that cause disease should pave the way for new strategies in diagnosis, therapy, and disease prevention.&#8221; Instead, what happened is that genome editing technology has arrived well before we have any idea of what the vast majority of the genome does, let alone the implications of edits to it. Similarly, while the coupling of IVF and genome sequencing makes it possible to select embryos based on genetic variants today, the reality is that we have no idea how the genome functions, or what the vast majority of genes or variants actually do.  </p>

<p>One thing that is known about the genome is that it is chock full of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy" target="_blank">pleiotropy</a>. This is statistical genetics jargon for the fact that variation at a single locus in the genome can affect many traits simultaneously. Whereas one might think naïvely that there are distinct genes affecting individual traits, in reality the genome is a complex web of interactions among its constituent parts, leading to extensive pleiotropy. In some cases pleiotropy can be <em>antagonistic</em>, which means that a genomic variant may simultaneously be harmful and beneficial. A famous example of this is the mutation to the beta globin gene that confers malaria resistance to heterozygotes (individuals with just one of their DNA copies carrying the mutation) and sickle cell anemia to homozygotes (individuals with both copies of their DNA carrying the mutation). </p>



<p>In the case of complex diseases we don&#8217;t really know enough, or anything, about the genome to be able to truly assess pleiotropy risks (or benefits). But there are some worries already. For example, HLA Class II genes are associated with Type I and non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/105/3/e245/5715056" target="_blank">Jacobi et al 2020</a>), Parkinson&#8217;s disease (e.g. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jneurology.com/articles/shared-human-leukocyte-antigen-hla-coverage-in-dementia-and-parkinsons-disease.html" target="_blank">James and Georgopolous 2020</a>, which also describes an association with dementia) and Alzheimer&#8217;s (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12017-020-08612-4" target="_blank">Wang and Xing 2020</a>). PES that results in selection against the variants associated with these diseases could very well lead to population susceptibility to infectious disease. Having said that, it is worth repeating that we don&#8217;t really know if the danger is serious, because we don&#8217;t have any idea what the vast majority of the genome does, nor the nature of antagonistic pleiotropy present in it. Almost certainly by selecting for one trait according to PRS, embryos will also be selected for a host of other unknown traits.</p>



<p>Thus, what can be said is that while Orchid Health is trying to convince potential customers to not &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834" target="_blank">roll the dice</a>&#8220;, by ignoring the complexities of pleiotropy and its implications for embryo selection, what the company is actually doing is in fact<em> </em>rolling the dice for its customers (for a fee).</p>

<p><strong>Population problems</strong></p>



<p>One of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/" target="_blank">Orchid Health&#8217;s selling points</a> is that unlike other tests that &#8220;look at 2% of only one partner&#8217;s genome&#8230;Orchid sequences 100% of both partner&#8217;s genomes&#8221; resulting in &#8220;6 billion data points&#8221;. This refers to the &#8220;couples report&#8221;, which is a companion product of sorts to the polygenic embryo screening. The couples report is assembled by using the sequenced genomes of parents to simulate the genomes of potential babies, each of which is evaluated for PRS&#8217; to provide a range of (PRS based) disease predictions for the couples potential children. Sequencing a whole genome is a lot more expensive that just assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel. That may be one reason that most direct-to-consumer genetics is based on polymorphism panels rather than sequencing. There is another: the vast majority of variation in the genome occurs at a known polymorphic sites (there are a few million out of the approximately 3 billion base pairs in the genome), and to the extent that a variant might associate with a disease, it is likely that a neighboring common variant, which will be inherited together with the causal one, can serve as a proxy. There are rare variants that have been shown to associate with disease, but whether or not they explain can explain a large fraction of (genetic) disease burden is still an open question (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young 2019</a>). So what has Siddiqui, who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/" target="_blank">touts the benefits of whole-genome sequencing in a recent interview</a>, discovered that others such as 23andme have missed? </p>



<p>It turns out there is value to whole-genome sequencing for polygenic risk score analysis, but it is when one is performing the genome-wide association studies on which the PRS are based. The reason is a bit subtle, and has to do with differences in genetics between populations. Specifically, as explained in (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0610-x" target="_blank">De La Vega and Bustamante, 2018</a>), variants that associate with a disease in one population may be different than variants that associate with the disease in another population, and whole-genome sequencing across populations can help to mitigate biases that result when restricting to SNP panels. Unfortunately, as De La Vega and Bustamante note, whole-genome sequencing for GWAS &#8220;would increase costs by orders of magnitude&#8221;. In any case, the value of whole-genome sequencing for PRS lies mainly in identifying relevant variants, not in assessing risk in individuals.</p>



<p>The issue of population structure affecting PRS unfortunately transcends considerations about whole-genome sequencing. (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/psychgenetics/Fulltext/2018/10000/Polygenic_risk_score_for_schizophrenia_is_more.2.aspx" target="_blank">Curtis 2018</a>) shows that PRS for schizophrenia is more strongly associated with ancestry than with the disease. Specifically, he shows that &#8220;The PRS for schizophrenia varied significantly between ancestral groups and was much higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between these groups was 10 times as high as the mean difference between European schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African and European subjects hardly overlapped.&#8221; The figure from Curtis&#8217; paper showing the distribution of PRS for schizophrenia across populations is displayed below (the three letter codes at the bottom are abbreviations for different population groups; CEU stands for Northern Europeans from Utah and is the lowest).</p>

<p>The dependence of PRS on population is a problem that is compounded by a general problem with GWAS, namely that Europeans and individuals of European descent have been significantly oversampled in GWAS. Furthermore, even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of PRS can depend on confounding factors such as socio-economic status (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48376" target="_blank">Mostafavi et al. 2020</a>). Practically speaking, the implications for PES are beyond troubling. The PRS scores in the reports customers of Orchid Health may be inaccurate or meaningless due to not only the genetic background or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture" target="_blank">admixture</a> of the parents involved, but also other unaccounted for factors. Embryo selection on the basis of such data becomes worse than just throwing dice, it can potentially lead to unintended consequences in the genomes of the selected embryos. (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0379-x" target="_blank">Martin et al. 2019</a>) show unequivocally that clinical use of polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities.</p>



<p><strong>People pathos</strong></p>



<p>The fact that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are jumping aboard a technically incoherent venture and are willing to set aside serious ethical and moral concerns is not very surprising. See, e.g. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-response-to-wsj-doubts-about-new-technology-2015-10" target="_blank">Theranos</a>, which was supported by its investors despite concerns being raised about the technical foundations of the company. After a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical story </a>appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the company put out a statement that </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in an age of seismic change in biotech &#8211; the ability to sequence genomes, the ability to edit genomes, and now the unprecedented ability to impact the health of a future child.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Her investors, many of whom got rich from cryptocurrency trading or bitcoin, cheer her on. One of her investors is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804" target="_blank">Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase</a>, who believes &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html" target="_blank">[Orchid is] a step towards where we need to go in medicine.</a>&#8221; I think I can understand some of the ego and money incentives of Silicon Valley that drive such sentiment. But one thing that disappoints me is that scientists I personally held in high regard, such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jan-liphardt" target="_blank">Jan Liphardt</a> (associate professor of Bioengineering at Stanford) who is on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/careers#scientists" target="_blank">scientific advisory board</a> and Carlos Bustamante (co-author of the paper about population structure associated biases in PRS mentioned above) who is an investor in Orchid Health, have associated themselves with the company. It&#8217;s also very disturbing that Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of 23andme whose team of statistical geneticists understand the subtleties of PRS, still went ahead and invested in the company.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Orchid Health&#8217;s polygenic embryo selection, which it will be offering later this year, is unethical and morally repugnant. My suggestion is to think twice before <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10JnJomtaCrGi0HE8r2EnwGvPzE4vJWAMHUR0HMXQcIg/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank">sending them three years of tax returns</a> to try to get a discount on their product.</p>

And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387" target="_blank">paper in <i>eLife</i></a> was far more measured and sophisticated, but the <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/" target="_blank">press release</a> said:</p><blockquote>The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...<br /><br />...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In probabilistic decision making, people, <span style="color: red;"><b>often without being aware of it</b></span>, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.</blockquote><p><br /></p><p>The unaware shall become aware. <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/" target="_blank">Further advice</a>:</p><blockquote>“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” <br /><br />...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387" target="_blank">Gagne et al., 2021</a>), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).<br />&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/s856/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="381" data-original-width="856" height="178" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h178/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><p></p>With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. <br /><p></p><p></p><p>Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17586866" rel="nofollow">reward</a>, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885654" target="_blank">punishment</a> (including in the authors' <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730669" target="_blank">own work</a>). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ <i>but see</i><b><i> </i></b><i><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461" target="_blank">Fried (2021</a></i>) ]<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> </p><p>Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:<br /></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms.&nbsp;</blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions. My snappish response to the press release concerns whether we can prescribe individualized therapies based on the differences between the yellow arrows on the left (“resilient people”) compared to the right (“internalizing people” — i.e., the anxious and depressed), given that the participants may not even realize they're learning anything.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s709/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="709" data-original-width="697" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w394-h400/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png" width="394" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<b>Footnote</b><br /><p></p><p><span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> I will leave it to Dr. Eiko Fried (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461" target="_blank">2021</a>) to explain whether we should accept (or reject) this bifactor model of “shared symptoms” vs. “unshared symptoms”.</p><p></p><p><br /><br /> <b>References</b><br /><br />Bell DE.

We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience &#8211; from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. </p>



<p>By now, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973">we have a preprint out</a>, and NMA has been covered in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">the Lancet</a>. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I&#8217;m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. <a href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/">Richard Gao wrote a great post</a> on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.</p>



<h2>A little background: my stint into teaching</h2>



<p>After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here&#8217;s my explanation of globals in Python:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type&#8230; If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it&#8217;s a module variable. That&#8217;s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. [&#8230;many rambling minutes later&#8230;]. In any case, don&#8217;t use globals if you can avoid them.</p></blockquote>



<p>Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn&#8217;t fit with novice students&#8217; current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner&#8217;s motivations &#8211; both intrinsic and extrinsic &#8211; and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically &#8211; at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!</p>



<p>In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/">Code in Place</a>. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford &#8211; <a href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html">including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel</a> &#8211; given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level &#8211; understanding what they&#8217;re stuck on, where they&#8217;re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.</p>

<p>A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording&#8217;s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team &#8211; Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  &#8211; working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn&#8217;t know I was ready for. So <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">if you&#8217;re wondering whether industry is right for you</a>, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it&#8217;s a great place to get that experience.</p>



<h2>Deciding what to build</h2>



<p>When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you&#8217;re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">Heilmeier questions</a>:</p>



<ul><li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li><li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li><li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</li><li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li><li>What are the risks?</li><li>How much will it cost?</li><li>How long will it take?</li><li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li></ul>



<p>If you can answer these questions, you know what you&#8217;re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn&#8217;t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:</p>



<ul><li>We&#8217;re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.</li><li>Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don&#8217;t foster belonging. </li><li>We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.</li><li>We&#8217;ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.</li><li>Execution risk and legal risk</li><li>1500$ for each TA, and we&#8217;re aiming for 200 TAs</li><li>We&#8217;re launching July 13th</li><li>We&#8217;ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.</li></ul>



<p>Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier&#8217;s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee&#8217;s duties. The curriculum committee&#8217;s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.</p>



<h2>Running on enthusiasm</h2>



<p>I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We&#8217;re democratizing education! We&#8217;re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We&#8217;re doing something no one&#8217;s ever done! </p>



<p>I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer&#8217;s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer&#8217;s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you&#8217;re refusing to accept that gift, and that&#8217;s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step &#8211; you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! </p>



<p>For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There&#8217;s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done &#8211; update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in &#8211; we used <a href="http://quire.io/">quire</a>, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It&#8217;s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.</p>



<p>If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.</p>



<h2>Running like clockwork</h2>



<p>Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen &#8211; when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.</p>

<p>For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. <a href="https://twitter.com/emdupre">Elizabeth DuPre</a> pointed me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference">this talk by the creator of Elm</a> &#8211; in open source projects, the right culture doesn&#8217;t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. &#8220;Deadlines matter&#8221; is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you&#8217;re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can&#8217;t do that at NMA &#8211; your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. &#8211; if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. </p>



<p>If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran &#8211; ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me &#8220;a little German&#8221; for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I&#8217;m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/">It&#8217;s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism</a> &#8211; we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that&#8217;s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn&#8217;t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a &#8220;good enough&#8221; version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. </p>



<h2>You need good tools to work productively with each other</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, Fred Brooks claims that &#8220;adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later&#8221;. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle &#8211; a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.</p>



<p>So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.</p>



<p>Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (<a href="https://www.wevideo.com/">WeVideo</a>) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.</p>



<h2>You need good organization to work productively with each</h2>



<p>The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don&#8217;t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>



<p>The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student&#8217;s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That&#8217;s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It&#8217;s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel &#8211; everybody is on the same side. It&#8217;s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/">This kind of design thinking</a> &#8211; ship early, ship often, iterate &#8211; can be applied to all aspects of open source education.</p>



<p>The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.</p>



<p>Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:</p>

<h2>Making decisions under uncertainty</h2>



<p>How do you make decisions swiftly and effectively in a big org? We had hundreds of volunteers; <a href="https://osf.io/9fp4v/">134 authors on the curriculum paper alone</a>. 134 very smart people cannot all be of the same opinion at the same time in the face of uncertainty. The first step to make decisions effectively is to separate decision making and execution. It&#8217;s very easy to leave a lot of decisions to be implicit until it&#8217;s crunch time. It happened a couple of times that I made a medium-scale decision or encouraged other people to make medium-scale decisions during a daily standup meeting. Big mistake. A lot of people affected by the decisions weren&#8217;t in the room; they felt unheard and now burdened to go to a daily meeting to stay in the loop. Don&#8217;t do that &#8211; take bigger decisions in separate planning meetings. Every software methodology has some notion of a planning meeting, whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">scrum</a> or whatever &#8211; by the end of that meeting you should be clear about what to do for the next week or month. </p>



<p>One thing that can sap a lot of energy at these meetings is having circular arguments: revisiting the same question in subsequent meetings even though you thought you had come to an agreement. Sometimes, one person thinks a decision was made, while another thinks things were still under discussion. Write down decisions in meeting notes, share them with everyone.</p>



<p>Some orgs in the for-profit sector are hierarchical, so that disagreements get resolved top-down. That doesn&#8217;t really work in the non-profit sector, where people are there on a volunteer basis. In non-profit and in open source communities, many orgs thus use consensus-based decision making. I think pure consensus-based decision making is very difficult to get right. I&#8217;m a member of a not-for-profit makerspace that&#8217;s built on anarchist principles. We use consensus-based decision-making, and it gets rowdy: flame wars on our message board are not infrequent, whether it&#8217;s about resource allocation and who gets the space when and whose responsibility it is to take the trash out. Pure consensus-based decision making can have an insidious effect that people that are not in agreement with the majority are left isolated as &#8220;difficult&#8221; and &#8220;not a team player&#8221;. That can breed resentment, which leads to personality clashes, which leads to dysfunction: decision making grinds to a halt.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an alternative to pure consensus-based decision making: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>. You replace the norm that consensus must be reached with an alternative norm:</p>



<ol><li>everybody&#8217;s opinion should be understood </li><li>decisions are made based on majority or supermajority</li><li>it&#8217;s ok to disagree with a decision but we all bound ourselves to the decision</li></ol>



<p>To make sure that you understand somebody&#8217;s opinion &#8211; especially an opinion you don&#8217;t agree with &#8211;  you can use the <a href="https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/">Steel Man technique</a>. You restate the strongest version of their argument and engage with that. Oftentimes that will resolve whatever argument you had in the first place, or prepare you to build a hybrid solution. If you don&#8217;t come to a resolution, at least everyone will understand that they have been heard and understood. Decisions can take place in realtime in a synchronous meeting, or through a polling app in Slack (if a poll, put a deadline on it so it doesn&#8217;t drag on; in either case, quorum should be reached). If somebody disagreed with the decision, the norm says that that&#8217;s good and healthy, as long as they commit to the decision like everyone, so it doesn&#8217;t breed resentment in the long term. </p>



<h2>Be the change you wish to see</h2>



<p>My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">I&#8217;m a firm believer in Murphy&#8217;s law</a> &#8211; but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students&#8217; intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That&#8217;s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students&#8217; emotional needs. That&#8217;s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.</p>



<p>Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads &#8211; I can be a difficult person and that&#8217;s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant&#8217;s email signature):</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology/">Disability, access, and the virtual conference</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jon-tyson-yIIXtxxdrUI-unsplash-744x286.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>After my first Zoom meeting of the pandemic, I found myself lying on the bathroom floor with my noise-cancelling headphones on, on the verge of a full-blown meltdown. As an autistic person, I’ve always been hypersensitive to noise and to visual stimuli—but I hadn’t realized that a Zoom meeting with my colleagues could cause sensory overload. The number of images on the computer screen, the amount of movement in those tiny thumb-nail images, and the speed with which the images had moved, flashed, and changed—not to mention the obtrusive noise of malfunctioning microphones and noisy, socially-distanced households—had been enough to make me physically sick. Although many people tend to assume that an online event is automatically more accessible than an in-person event (after all, people can attend without leaving their homes), this isn’t always the case. Even when online events <em>are</em> more accessible, one of the lessons the pandemic has reminded me of is that the act of creating disability access can fundamentally change the nature of the thing that is accessed.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>In writing my new book, <em>Shakespeare and Disability Studies</em>, I was interested in exploring disability access as art and in exploring disability access as a complicated (and complicating) multifaceted phenomenon. Disability access is rarely just a question of “Can someone with X impairment use Y?” but rather more often a question of “If we modify Y so that someone with X impairment can use it, how does it change the meaning, the experience, and the effect of Y?” Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible, whether the thing made accessible is a Shakespeare play (“the play’s the thing”) or a Zoom meeting. When we change the nature of the thing made accessible, we don’t just create access and inclusion for people with disabilities—we often create a new kind of experience altogether. I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities. Sometimes those new works, events, and objects bear a resemblance to the inaccessible version from which they grew. At other times, they do not.</p><p>Perhaps the most complex possibility, and the one most fundamentally counter-intuitive to a culture in which able-bodied and neurotypical (non-autistic) thinking are prioritized, is when creating accessibility not only fundamentally changes the nature of the thing made accessible but also causes attendees with a disability to lose something valuable. This seems counter-intuitive because stereotypical ways of thinking about disability have (falsely) taught us that disability experience does not include pleasure and that eliminating barriers to access is always an inherent and uncomplicated good. Neither of these things is true. For example, this year I’ll lead seminars at two Shakespeare conferences (the Shakespeare Association of America and the World Shakespeare Congress). Because of the pandemic, both conferences, for the first time ever, will be held completely online. However, these virtual events are more complicated for me than they originally seem, and their accessibility represents both gain and loss.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>In some ways, both conferences will be more accessible for me in an online format. Traveling can be difficult for some autistic people (keeping in mind the effect of Zoom on my body and mind, imagine the effect of a crowded airport). I usually travel annually to the Shakespeare Association of America—but with much ado. I can’t fly alone (nor hope to navigate unfamiliar city streets or crowded hotels by myself) and so always travel with a support person. My support person is usually another Shakespearean, a kind volunteer who, after weathering the sensory travails of the airport and public transportation, will spend the conference with me. I am not independent. But also, I am never alone. Everything in my life is shared. There is a certain beauty in that. After a busy day of seminars and panels, I will lie on the hotel room bed in the fetal position, far too worn out from the crowds and the noise to do anything else, and my support person and I will gossip together with great pleasure about the intellectual goings-on of the conference.</p><p>Disability, in our culture, is stereotyped as loss. Accessibility, in our culture, is deemed as always good, always a gain. It is also often misunderstood as simple and one-dimensional, as easy to understand and to explain. This year, for the first time ever, I will attend the Shakespeare Association of America without a support person. I will be independent. It is important, however, to think about the enormous cost of making the conference fully accessible to me. This act of access will fundamentally change the nature of what the conference is. The only way to make the conference fully accessible to me is for its social component, its travel component, its in-person component, to be completely removed. This represents a loss for all of the people at the conference and, ironically, also a loss for me. Because after my seminar at the 2021 Shakespeare Association of America, I won’t return to my hotel room to gossip about the intellectual goings-on of the conference with my support person. Rather, I will shut down my computer and reflect silently on the events of the conference&#8230; alone&#8230; for the first time in my life.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jon Tyson</a> on Unsplash</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/647352848/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f03%2fjon-tyson-yIIXtxxdrUI-unsplash-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/647352848/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/lets-raise-our-taxes-infrastructure-and-the-american-character/">Let&#8217;s raise our taxes!

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/03/11/update-name-change-policy/">Update: Name change policy</a></h4>

              
                <p>arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.</p>
<p>arXiv now offers the following name change options:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address</li>
<li aria-level="1">In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions</li>
<li aria-level="1">In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed</li>
</ol>
<p>We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.</p>
<p>arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.</p>
<p>If you would like to request a name change, please contact us <a href="http://arxiv.org/support/general_help">through our user support portal</a> or at <a href="mailto:help@arxiv.org">help@arxiv.org</a>.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/"><img width="480" height="184" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Eye-image-1260-x-485-744x285.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?</p><p>Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.</p><p>Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene <em>UBE3A</em>, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?</p><p>The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are <em>covertly conscious</em>—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.</p><p>Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true">dreamless sleep</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;tag=1">anesthesia</a>. Interestingly, it is also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421">increased by psychedelic drugs</a> that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?</p><p>My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1">to test this hypothesis</a> using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.</p><p>As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.</p><p>But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.</p><p>The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.</p><p>Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.</p><p>The above technique, called the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf">perturbational complexity index</a> or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645656224/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2fEye-image-1260-x-485-744x285.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/the-vsi-podcast-season-two-homer-film-music-consciousness-samurai-and-more/">The VSI podcast season two: Homer, film music, consciousness, samurai, and more</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
&quot;microstates&quot;.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.</p>
<p>We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/">Why arXiv needs a brand</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Pop quiz: There are so many &#8220;-Xivs&#8221; online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: only <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv"><strong>@arXiv</strong></a></p>
<p>arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,&#8221; said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.</p>
<p>In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv&#8217;s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.</p>
<p>Throughout the identity project, we:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">assessed user feedback collected since 2016,</li>
<li aria-level="1">surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,</li>
<li aria-level="1">gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,</li>
<li aria-level="1">contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and</li>
<li aria-level="1">are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To guide our branding efforts we focused on <b>arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science</b>. After many rounds of revision and refinement, <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">arXiv’s first brand guide</a> was produced, in addition to our new logo and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a>, and we&#8217;d like to share them with you now.</p>
<figure id="attachment_948" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-948" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png"><img class="wp-image-948 size-medium" style="margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; margin-top: 10px;" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png" alt="arXiv's logo" width="260" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png 1024w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-768x346.png 768w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-948" class="wp-caption-text">The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection</figcaption></figure>
<p>The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, <strong>the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo</strong> captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">brand guide</a> and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a> ensure that we express arXiv&#8217;s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.</p>
<p>The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.</p>
<p>&#8220;arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,&#8221; said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.</p>

<h2>Where is the red nucleus?</h2><p class="">The red nucleus is found in a region of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/midbrain" target="_blank">midbrain</a>. There are actually two red nuclei—one on each side of the brainstem. </p><p class="">The red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures that are generally distinct in function: the parvocellular red nucleus, which mainly contains small and medium-sized <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a>, and the magnocellular red nucleus, which contains larger neurons. The red nucleus is recognizable immediately after dissection because it maintains a reddish coloring. This coloring is thought to be due to iron pigments found in the cells of the nucleus.</p><h2>What is the red nucleus and what does it do?</h2><p class="">As mentioned above, the red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures with separate functions: the parvocellular red nucleus and the magnocellular red nucleus. In the human brain, most of the red nucleus is made up of the parvocellular red nucleus, or RNp; the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is not thought to play a major role in the adult human brain. In four-legged mammals (e.g., cats, mice), however, the RNm is a more prominent structure—in both size and importance.</p><p class="">Neurons from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum" target="_blank">cerebellum</a> project to the RNm, and RNm neurons leave the red nucleus and form the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/rubrospinal-tract" target="_blank">rubrospinal tract</a>, which descends in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>. In animals that walk on four legs, this pathway is activated around the time of voluntary movements; it seems to play an important role in walking, avoiding obstacles, and making coordinated paw movements. RNm neurons, however, also respond to sensory stimulation, and may provide sensory feedback to the cerebellum to help guide movements and maintain postural stability. </p><p class="">In primates that mainly walk on two legs (including humans), the RNm is not thought to play a large role in walking and maintaining postural stability, as other tracts (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticospinal-tract" target="_blank">corticospinal tract</a>) take over such functions. The RNm, however, does appear to be involved in controlling hand movements in humans and other primates. Interestingly, the RNm is more prominent in the human fetus and newborn, but regresses as a child ages, which may have to do with the development of corticospinal tract and the ability to walk on two legs.</p><p class="">Despite its relatively greater import in the human brain, the RNp is poorly understood, as its diminished presence in other animals makes it more difficult to study using an animal model. Neurons from motor areas in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/prefrontal-cortex" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/premotor-cortex" target="_blank">premotor cortex</a>, as well as neurons from nuclei in the cerebellum known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-cerebellar-nuclei" target="_blank">deep cerebellar nuclei</a>, extend to the RNp. There is also a collection of neurons that leave the RNp and travel to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-olivary-nucleus" target="_blank">inferior olivary nucleus</a>, which communicates with the cerebellum and is thought to be involved in the control of movement. A number of proposed functions have been attributed to these connections between the RNp, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus, such as movement learning, the acquisition of reflexes, and the detection of errors in movements. But the precise function of these pathways—and thus the RNp’s role in them—is still not clear.</p><p class="">Several studies have found the red nucleus to play a role in pain sensation as well as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/analgesia" target="_blank">analgesia</a>. The latter might be due to connections between the red nucleus and regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/periaqueductal-gray" target="_blank">periaqueductal gray</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/raphe-nuclei" target="_blank">raphe nuclei</a>, which are part of a natural pain-inhibiting system in the brain. </p><p class="">In terms of pathology, dysfunction in the human red nucleus has been linked to the development of tremors, and is being investigated as playing a potential role in <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Damage to the red nucleus has also been associated with a number of other problems with movement and muscle tone.</p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Basile GA, Quartu M, Bertino S, Serra MP, Boi M, Bramanti A, Anastasi GP, Milardi D, Cacciola A.

                <p>This month's episode of <em>Brain Science</em> features <a title="wikipedia" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Baron-Cohen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sir Simon Baron-Cohen</a>, one of the world's leading researchers on the neuroscience of autism. We discuss his latest book "<a title="Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3hzKTdW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pattern Seekers: How Autism Drives Human Invention</a>." This book reminds us that many different kinds of science can enrich our lives and our understanding of what it means to be human.</p> Sir Baron-Cohen explores the overlap between the human ability to invent and experiment and the condition that is currently called autism. Autism is often seen as a deficit in social cognition or empathy, but Baron-Cohen shows convincingly that there is a significant overlap between autism and what he calls extreme systemizing. Because systemizing or pattern recognition drives the human ability to constantly invent new technologies, it appears to compliment social skills such as empathy.   Sir Baron-Cohen share the evidence that people tend to be stronger in one area or the other. Most importantly, he emphasizes that autism is not necessarily a disabling condition because those with extremely strong pattern recognition skills can make many valuable contributions. <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><em><a title="Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3hzKTdW" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">The Pattern Seekers: How Autism Drives Human Invention</a></em> by Simon Baron-Cohen</li> <li> <p>Greenberg DM, Warrier V, Allison C, Baron-Cohen S.

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology/">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sky-2910165_1920-744x286.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Was Darwin a one-trick pony? The scientists who most praise him typically cite just one of his ideas: natural selection. Do any know that his theory of evolution—like his take on psychology—presumed all creatures were agents? This fact has long been eclipsed by the “gene’s-eye view” of adaptation which gained a strangle-hold over biology during the twentieth century—and hence over sociobiology and today’s evolutionary psychology. Are current efforts to revise this view—emphasising “new” topics like the flexibility of phenotypes (an organism’s living characteristics) and the importance of development in adaptation—simply rediscovering Darwin’s approach?</p><p>How do members of a species come to differ from each other, thus furnishing the raw material for the struggle whose results Darwin subsumed under what he called the <em>law</em> of natural selection? In two ways, wrote Darwin in 1859. A creature’s parents <em>transmit</em> different characteristics to them as starting-points for their lives. And, over their life-course, creatures <em>develop</em> their starting-characteristics in different ways, depending on how they respond to the various challenges they meet. In 1942, Julian Huxley and his colleagues recast natural selection as <em>a mechanism</em>, not a law. Imagine twinned roulette-wheels: each individual’s evolutionary fate resulted from a random genetic provision of phenotypic traits being pitted against a lottery of environmental events. This new language of genes, genomes, and (from 1953) DNA, made Darwin look ignorant about how individual differences arose. Dying before genes or DNA were discovered, he never knew that mutations and chromosome-changes caused all variations (according to Huxley).</p><p>To retain Darwin as the figurehead of this gene-first take on nature, he was retro-fitted with twentieth-century beliefs. If DNA “programmes” what creatures are and do, genetic processes drive evolution forward, not creaturely acts. Hence, Huxley asserted, the “great merit” of Darwin was his proof that living organisms never acted purposively: everything they did could be accounted for “on good mechanistic principles.” Likewise, even when Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin spoke out <em>against</em> the way the cult of genes blinds us to the active role organisms play in adaptation, his first target was Darwin, who, Lewontin said, portrayed organisms “as passive objects moulded by the external force of natural selection.”</p><p>Lewontin’s vouch that organisms help shape their own fates is now gaining traction. Few genes behave as they should according to Mendel. So, talk about genes “for” a phenotypic character is rarely appropriate. Even when we know everything we can about genes and environment, we still cannot predict what characteristics will emerge in an organism—proving phenotypes are independent sources of plasticity in the genesis of adaptations. Organisms help cause their own development and destiny, which means phenotypes themselves have evolutionary effects. Never mind why a fly hatches from its pupa to be small: its unusually big surface to volume ratio cannot help but shape its remaining life-history. This point underlines findings from biologists who study animal behaviour. Beavers build dams, chimps and crows make tools, wolves hunt better in packs. All such feats alter the evolutionary prospects of phenotypes.</p><p>Darwin’s books herald all these emphases: the distinction between transmission and development when discussing inheritance; the “plasticity of organisation” in all creatures; and, importantly here, the tie between action and structure. Darwin saw nature as a theatre of agency. The roots of cabbage seedlings successfully improvised, after Darwin experimentally blocked them from plunging straight down into the earth. Earthworms “intelligently” grasped how best to tug his artificially-shaped “leaves” to plug their holes against the cold. And when newly-arrived finches were competing for food on the Galapagos Islands, it must have been the birds who first found the best new diets—not random genetic changes—who gained reproductive supremacy and consequently, over millennia, such new bodily adaptations as the skin-piercing beak of blood-sucking Vampire Finches.</p><p>Actions produce reactions, <em>The</em> <em>Origin of Species</em> repeatedly reminds us. Which means an organism’s actions inevitably render it interdependent with its habitat, animate and inanimate. Such ties may be competitive or cooperative—“mutual aid” being the hallmark of evolution in “social animals” like us. Hence, when Darwin published his views on human agency in <em>The Descent of Man</em>—first published 150 years ago this month—and its sequel, <em>The Expression of the Emotions</em> (1872), social interdependency took pride of place. Darwin argued non-verbal expressions to be <em>purposeless</em> by-products of functional habits—we weep because we protectively close our eyes when screaming, incidentally squeezing our tear-glands. Such unintended side-effects only come to signify emotion because <em>others “</em>recognize” their meaning as linked to suffering. When I blush, my inbuilt capacity for reading expressions has rebounded, leading me to read in you how I imagine you to be reading me. Such “self-attention” underpins sexual display, plus such quintessentially human traits as language, culture, and conscience.</p><p>Go back to what Darwin wrote about evolution, and you will hear him speaking from a place that the latest biology now renders prescient. Interdependencies of agency not only forge individual differences, and winnow the kernels of inter-generational success from the chaff of failure. They also compose Darwin’s unsung creation of the first naturalistic psychology.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/sky-sunset-darwin-mangrove-horizon-2910165/">Pat Josse</a></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645043306/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2fsky-2910165_1920-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-did-evolution-create-conscious-states-of-mind/">Why did evolution create conscious states of mind?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

Your brain uses electricity to communicate, its neurons talking to each other by sending tiny pulses of voltage down a gossamer thin cable. We neuroscientists call those pulses “spikes”. And as spikes are how neurons communicate, they are how you do anything: talk, eat, and run; see, plan, and decide.</p><p>It is the spikes pouring forth from the end of motor neurons that make your muscles contract just so, into a broad grin, eyes wrinkling; into an outstretched arm, grasping that steaming mug; into the thumb swiping up and up, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling your feeds.</p><p>It is the spikes pouring from your retina that brought the grin-inducing skit, the half-forgotten coffee, the smeary phone screen into your purview. And it is the spikes pouring across cortex that do much of what makes you human, of reading, listening to, and understanding words.</p><p>Of the 86 billion neurons in the adult human brain, about 17 billion of those are found in the cortex. Each of those sends at most one spike per second, on average. The United Nations tells us the expected lifespan of a human on this planet is about 70 years. That’s more than two billion seconds, each of which contains about 17 billion spikes in your cortex. All told, your lifespan is about 34 billion billion cortical spikes.</p><p>In my new book, THE SPIKE, I tell you the story of just two of those seconds.

A journey from seeing to deciding to moving, from eye to hand.</p><p>THE SPIKE is the story of everywhere the spike was sent, and of everything it saw on the way — the twinkling galaxy of neurons, the deep darkness of the cortex, the loneliest neuron.

Your first wobbly, uncertain steps. The pain when Susan’s wildly swinging arm knocked out your wobbly tooth in primary school. Recognising that cluster of trees in the distance, and the relief of knowing you’ll now find your way across the damp, foggy hills back to the welcome warmth of the car. Plucking up the courage to ask for a date, and blurting it all out in a rush. The flush of embarrassment. The quiet euphoria of a yes.

                <p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichieHakim/status/1363545448317878282">Richie Hakim asked</a> whether the toolbox Cascade for spike inference (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) induces temporal dispersion of the predicted spiking activity compared to ground truth. This kind of temporal dispersion had been observed in a study from last year (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198">Wei et al., PLoS Comp Biol, 2020</a>; also discussed in a previous <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/">blog post</a>), suggesting that analyses based on raw or deconvolved calcium imaging data might falsely suggest continuous sequences of neuronal activations, while the true activity patterns are coming in discrete bouts.</p>



<p>To approach this question, I used one of our 27 ground truth datasets (the one recorded for the original GCaMP6f paper). From all recordings in this data set, I detected events that exceeded a certain ground truth spike rate. Next, I assigned these extracted events in 3 groups and systematically shifted the detected event of groups 1 and 3 by 0.5 seconds forth and back. Note that this is a short shift compared to the timescale investigated by the Wei et al. paper. This is how the ground truth looks like. It is clearly not a continuous sequence of activations:</p>

<p>To evaluate whether the three-bout pattern would result in a continuous sequence after spike inference, I just used the dF/F recordings associated with above ground truth recordings and Cascade&#8217;s global model for excitatory neurons (a pretrained network that is available with the toolbox), I infered the spike rates. There is indeed some dispersion due to the difficulty to infer spike rates from noisy data. But the three bouts are very clearly visible.</p>

<p>This is even more apparent when plotting the average spike rate across neurons:</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that there are conditions and existing datasets where discrete activity bouts can be clearly distinguished from sequential activations based on spike rates inferred with Cascade.</p>



<p>This analysis was performed on neurons at a standardized noise level of 2% Hz<sup>-1</sup> (see the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint </a>for a proper definition of the standardized noise level). This is a typical and very decent noise level for population calcium imaging. However, if we perform the same analysis on the same data set but with a relatively high noise level of 8% Hz<sup>-1</sup>, the resulting predictions are indeed much more dispersed, since the dF/F patterns are too noisy to make more precise predictions. The average spike rate still shows three peaks, but they are only riding on top of a more broadly distributed, seemingly persistent increase of the spike rate.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/dynamique-et-controle-epidemique-quelques-concepts-simples/">Dynamique et contrôle épidémique : quelques concepts simples</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dans ce texte, j’essaie d’expliquer quelques concepts simples concernant la dynamique et le contrôle d’une épidémie. Je l’écris bien sûr en pensant à l’épidémie de Covid-19, mais la plupart des concepts sont généraux. En préambule, je tiens à préciser que je ne suis ni médecin ni épidémiologiste, donc je ne parlerai pratiquement pas des aspects purement médicaux, ni de subtilités d’épidémiologie, mais simplement de quelques notions générales. Ma spécialité est la modélisation de phénomènes dynamiques en biologie, en l’occurrence en neurosciences. Merci donc aux collègues compétents d’apporter des précisions ou corrections éventuelles, ou des références pertinentes.</p>
<p><strong>Quelques remarques préliminaires sur les statistiques</strong></p>
<p>Avant de commencer les explications, je voudrais tout d’abord inviter le lecteur à la prudence quant à l’interprétation des statistiques, en particulier des statistiques de mortalité. A l’heure où j’écris ces lignes, on estime qu’environ 15% de la population française a été infectée. Autrement dit, l’épidémie est débutante. Les statistiques de mortalité ne sont donc pas un « bilan » de l’épidémie, mais des statistiques sur une épidémie en cours. Comparer avec le bilan d’épidémies passées, ou d’autres causes de mortalité, n’a donc pas beaucoup de sens (éventuellement, on pourrait multiplier par 5 ces statistiques pour avoir un ordre d’idée).</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie ne dépend pas que du virus. Elle dépend aussi de la personne malade. Un facteur majeur est l’âge, et il faut donc prendre cela en compte lorsque l’on compare des pays de démographies très différentes. En première approximation, le risque de décès de la Covid-19 augmente avec l’âge de la même manière que le risque de décès hors Covid. On peut voir cela comme le fait que les jeunes sont peu à risque, ou bien que toutes les classes d’âge voient leur risque de décès dans l’année augmenter d’un même facteur. Quoi qu’il en soit, avec ce type de profil de mortalité, l’âge moyen ou médian au décès n’est pas très informatif puisqu’il est le même avec et sans infection.</p>
<p>Troisièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie dépend aussi de la prise en charge. En l’occurrence, la Covid-19 se caractérise par un fort taux d’hospitalisation et de réanimation. La mortalité observée en France jusqu’à présent correspond à celle d’un système de soin qui n’est pas saturé. Naturellement, elle serait bien plus élevée si l’on ne pouvait pas procurer ces soins, c’est-à-dire si l’épidémie n’était pas contrôlée, et la mortalité se déplacerait également vers une population plus jeune.</p>
<p>Enfin, il va de soi que la gravité d’une maladie ne se réduit pas à sa mortalité. Une hospitalisation n’est généralement pas anodine, et les cas moins sévères peuvent avoir des séquelles à long terme.</p>
<p><strong>Le taux de reproduction</strong></p>
<p>Un virus est une entité qui peut se répliquer dans un hôte et se transmettre à d’autres hôtes. Contrairement à une bactérie qui est une cellule, un virus n’est pas à proprement parler un organisme, c’est-à-dire qu’il dépend totalement de l’hôte pour sa survie et sa reproduction. Par conséquent, pour comprendre la dynamique d’une épidémie virale, il faut s’intéresser au nombre d’hôtes infectés et à la transmission entre hôtes.</p>
<p>Un paramètre important est le <em>taux de reproduction </em>(R). C’est le nombre moyen de personnes qu’une personne infectée va contaminer. On voit que l’épidémie se développe si R&gt;1, et s’éteint si R&lt;1. A chaque transmission, le nombre de cas est multiplié par R. Ce taux de reproduction ne dit pas à quelle vitesse l’épidémie se développe, car cela dépend du temps d’incubation et de la période de contagiosité. C’est en fait un paramètre qui est surtout intéressant pour comprendre le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, si <em>R = 2</em>, alors on peut contrôler l’épidémie en divisant par deux le nombre de ses contacts.</p>
<p>Comme le nombre de cas est multiplié par un certain facteur à chaque épisode de contamination, une épidémie a typiquement une dynamique exponentielle, c’est-à-dire que c’est le nombre de chiffres qui augmente régulièrement. Cela prend autant de temps de passer de 10 à 100 cas que de 100 à 1000 cas, ou de 1000 à 10 000 cas. La dynamique est donc de nature explosive. C’est pourquoi la quantité à suivre avec attention n’est pas tant le nombre de cas que ce taux de reproduction : dès que R&gt;1, le nombre de cas peut rapidement exploser et il faut agir vite.</p>
<p>Naturellement, ce raisonnement suppose que la population n’a pas été déjà infectée. Si une proportion <em>p</em> de la population est immunisée (infectée ou vaccinée), alors chaque personne infectée va contaminer en moyenne un nombre de personnes <em>R</em> x (1-<em>p</em>). L’épidémie va donc s’arrêter quand ce nombre descend en-dessous de 1, c’est-à-dire <em>p &gt; 1- 1/R</em>. Par exemple, avec <em>R = 3</em>, l’épidémie s’arrête quand les 2/3 de population sont immunisés.</p>
<p>Ceci nous dit également l’impact de la vaccination en cours sur le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, à l’heure où j’écris ces lignes (22 février 2021), environ 2% de la population a été vaccinée (4% a reçu la première dose). Cela contribue donc à diminuer R de 2% (par exemple de 1.1 à 1.08). Il est donc clair que la vaccination n’aura pas d’effet important sur la dynamique globale avant plusieurs mois.</p>
<p>Il est important de comprendre que ce taux de reproduction n’est pas une caractéristique intrinsèque du virus. Il dépend du virus, mais également de l’hôte qui peut être plus ou moins contagieux (on a parlé par exemple des « superspreaders »), d’aspects comportementaux, de mesures de protection (par exemple les masques). Ce taux n’est donc pas forcément homogène dans une population. Par exemple, il est vraisemblable que le R soit supérieur chez les jeunes actifs que chez les personnes âgées.</p>
<p><strong>Peut-on isoler une partie de la population ?</strong></p>
<p>Est-il possible de préserver la population la plus fragile en l’isolant du reste de la population, sans contrôler l’épidémie ? Cette hypothèse a été formulée plusieurs fois, bien que <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230">très critiquée dans la littérature scientifique</a>.</p>
<p>On peut comprendre assez facilement que c’est une idée périlleuse. Isoler une partie de la population a un impact quasi nul sur le taux de reproduction R, et donc la dynamique de l’épidémie est inchangée. Il faut bien garder à l’esprit que contrôler une épidémie pour qu’elle s’éteigne suppose simplement de faire en sorte que R&lt;1, de façon à ce que le nombre de cas décroisse exponentiellement. Ainsi pendant le confinement strict de mars 2020, le taux était d’environ R = 0.7. C’est suffisant pour que l’épidémie s’éteigne, mais il n’en reste pas moins qu’une personne infectée continue à contaminer d’autres gens. Par conséquent, à moins de parvenir à isoler ces personnes fragiles beaucoup plus strictement que lors du premier confinement (ce qui semble douteux étant donné qu’il s’agit pour partie de personnes dépendantes), l’épidémie dans cette population va suivre l’épidémie dans la population générale, avec la même dynamique mais dans une version un peu atténuée. Autrement dit, il semble peu plausible que cette stratégie soit efficace.</p>
<p><strong>Les variants</strong></p>
<p>Un virus peut muter, c’est-à-dire que lorsqu’il se réplique dans un hôte, des erreurs sont introduites de sorte que les propriétés du virus changent. Cela peut avoir un impact sur les symptômes, ou sur la contagiosité. Naturellement, plus il y a d’hôtes infectés, plus il y a de variants, c’est donc un phénomène qui survient dans des épidémies non contrôlées.</p>
<p>Supposons que R = 2 et qu’un variant ait un taux R = 4. Alors à chaque transmission, le nombre de cas du variant relatif au virus original est multiplié par 2. Au bout de 10 transmissions, le variant représente 99.9% des cas. Ceci reste vrai si des mesures restrictives réduisent la transmission (par exemple R=2/3 et R=4/3). Après ces 10 transmissions, le R global est celui du variant. Par conséquent, c’est le nombre de cas et le R du variant plus contagieux qui déterminent le nombre de cas et la dynamique à moyen terme (c’est-à-dire quelques semaines). Le nombre de cas du virus original et même le nombre de cas globaux sont essentiellement insignifiants.</p>
<p>Cela signifie que l’on peut être dans une dynamique explosive alors même que le nombre de cas diminue. Pour savoir si l’épidémie est sous contrôle, il faut regarder le R du variant le plus contagieux. A l’heure où j’écris, on est précisément dans la situation où le virus original est encore dominant avec R&lt;1 et les variants ont un R&gt;1, ce qui signifie que malgré une diminution globale des cas, on est dans une dynamique explosive qui sera apparente dans le nombre global de cas lorsque les variants seront dominants.</p>
<p><strong>Le contrôle épidémique</strong></p>
<p>Contrôler l’épidémie signifie faire en sorte que R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas diminue exponentiellement et s’approche de 0. Il ne s’agit pas nécessairement de supprimer toute transmission mais de faire en sorte par une combinaison de mesures que R soit plus petit que 1. Ainsi, passer de R = 1.1 à 0.9 suffit pour passer d’une épidémie explosive à une extinction de l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Naturellement, la mesure la plus sûre pour éteindre l’épidémie est d’empêcher toute relation sociale (le « confinement »). Mais il existe potentiellement de nombreuses autres mesures, et idéalement il s’agit de combiner plusieurs mesures à la fois efficaces et peu contraignantes, le confinement pouvant être utilisé en dernier recours lorsque ces mesures ont échoué. La difficulté est que l’impact d’une mesure n’est pas précisément connu pour un virus nouveau.</p>
<p>Ces connaissances sont cependant loin d’être négligeables après un an d’épidémie de Covid-19. On sait par exemple que le port du masque est très efficace (on s’en doutait déjà, étant donné que c’est une infection respiratoire). On sait que le virus se propage par projection de gouttelettes et par aérosols. On sait également que les écoles et les lieux de restauration collective sont des lieux importants de contamination. Cette observation peut conduire à fermer ces lieux, mais on pourrait alternativement les sécuriser par l’installation de ventilation et de filtres (investissement qui pourrait d’ailleurs être synergique avec un plan de rénovation énergétique).</p>
<p>Il y a deux grands types de mesures. Il y a des mesures globales qui s’appliquent aux personnes saines comme aux porteurs du virus, comme le port du masque, la fermeture de certains lieux, la mise en place du télétravail. Le coût de ces mesures (au sens large, c’est-à-dire le coût économique et les contraintes) est fixe. Il y a des mesures spécifiques, c’est-à-dire qui sont déclenchées lorsqu’il y a un cas, comme le traçage, la fermeture d’une école, le confinement local. Ces mesures spécifiques ont un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Le coût global est donc une combinaison d’un coût fixe et d’un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Par conséquent, il est toujours plus coûteux de maîtriser une épidémie lorsque le nombre de cas est plus grand (choix qui semble pourtant avoir été fait en France après le deuxième confinement).</p>
<p><strong>Le « plateau »</strong></p>
<p>Une remarque importante : les mesures ont un impact sur la progression de l’épidémie (R) et non directement sur le nombre de cas. Cela signifie que si l’on sait maintenir un nombre de cas haut (R=1), alors on sait tout aussi bien (avec les mêmes mesures), maintenir un nombre de cas bas. Avec un petit effort supplémentaire (R=0.9), on peut supprimer l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Avoir comme objectif la saturation hospitalière n’a donc pas particulièrement d’intérêt, et est même un choix plus coûteux que la suppression. Il existe une justification à cet objectif, la stratégie consistant à « aplatir la courbe », qui a été suggérée au début de l’épidémie. Il s’agit de maximiser le nombre de personnes infectées de façon à immuniser rapidement toute la population. Maintenant qu’il existe un vaccin, cette stratégie n’a plus beaucoup de sens. Même sans vaccin, infecter toute la population sans saturer les services hospitaliers prendrait plusieurs années, sans parler naturellement de la mortalité.</p>
<p><strong>La suppression de l’épidémie</strong></p>
<p>Comme remarqué précédemment, il est plus facile de maîtriser une épidémie faible que forte, et donc une stratégie de contrôle doit viser non un nombre de cas « acceptables », mais un taux de reproduction R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas décroît exponentiellement. Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il faut prendre en compte les cas importés. C’est-à-dire que sur une période de contamination, le nombre de cas va passer non plus de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n</em> mais de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n + </em><em>I</em>, où <em>I</em> est le nombre de cas importés. Le nombre de cas va donc se stabiliser à <em>I/(1-R)</em> (par exemple, 3 fois le nombre de cas importés si R = 2/3). Si l’on veut diminuer encore le nombre de cas, il devient alors important d’empêcher l’importation de nouveaux cas (tests, quarantaine, etc).</p>
<p>Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il devient faisable d’appliquer des mesures spécifiques très poussées, c’est-à-dire pour chaque cas. Par exemple, pour chaque cas, on isole la personne, et l’on teste et on isole toutes les personnes susceptibles d’être également porteuses. Non seulement on identifie les personnes potentiellement contaminées par la personne positive, mais on recherche également la source de la contamination. En effet, si l’épidémie est portée par des événements de supercontamination (« clusters »), alors il devient plus efficace de remonter à la source de la contamination puis de suivre les cas contacts.</p>
<p>A faible circulation, comme on dispose de ces moyens supplémentaires pour diminuer la transmission, il devient possible de lever certains moyens non spécifiques (par exemple le confinement général ou autres restrictions sociales, les fermetures d’établissements et même le port du masque). Pour que les moyens spécifiques aient un impact important, un point clé est que la majorité des cas puissent être détectés. Cela suppose des tests systématiques massifs, par exemple en utilisant des tests salivaires, des drive-in, des tests groupés, des contrôles de température. Cela suppose que les personnes positives ne soient pas découragées de se tester et s’isoler (en particulier, en maintenant les revenus). Cela suppose également un isolement systématique en attente de résultat pour les cas suspectés. Autrement dit, pour avoir une chance de fonctionner, cette stratégie doit être appliquée de manière la plus systématique possible. L’appliquer sur 10% des cas n’a pratiquement aucun intérêt. C’est pourquoi elle n’a de sens que lorsque la circulation du virus est faible.</p>
<p>Il est important d’observer que dans cette stratégie, l’essentiel du coût et des contraintes est porté par le dispositif de test, puisque le traçage et l’isolement ne se produisent que lorsqu’un cas est détecté, ce qui idéalement arrive très rarement. Si elle demande une certaine logistique, c’est en revanche une stratégie économique et peu contraignante pour la population.</p>
<p><strong>Quand agir ?</strong></p>
<p>J’ai expliqué que maintenir un niveau élevé de cas est plus coûteux et plus contraignant que maintenir un niveau faible de cas. Maintenir un niveau très faible de cas est encore moins coûteux et contraignant, bien que cela demande plus d’organisation.</p>
<p>Bien entendu, pour passer d’un plateau haut à un plateau bas, il faut que l’épidémie décroisse, et donc transitoirement appliquer des mesures importantes. Si l’épidémie n’est pas contrôlée – et je rappelle que cela est le cas dès lors qu’un variant est en croissance (R&gt;1) même si le nombre global de cas décroît – ces mesures vont devoir être appliquées à un moment donné. Quand faut-il les appliquer ? Est-il plus avantageux d’attendre le plus possible avant de le faire ?</p>
<p>Ce n’est clairement jamais le cas, car plus on attend, plus le nombre de cas augmente et donc plus les mesures restrictives devront être appliquées longtemps avant d’atteindre l’objectif de circulation faible, où des mesures plus fines (traçage) pourront prendre le relais. Cela peut sembler contre-intuitif si le nombre de cas est en décroissance mais c’est pourtant bien le cas, parce que le nombre de cas à moyen terme ne dépend que du nombre de cas du variant le plus contagieux, et non du nombre de cas global. Donc, si le variant le plus contagieux est en expansion, attendre ne fait qu’allonger la durée des mesures restrictives.</p>
<p>De combien ? Supposons que le nombre de cas du virus (le variant le plus contagieux) double chaque semaine, et que les mesures restrictives divisent le nombre de cas par 2 en une semaine. Alors attendre une semaine avant de les appliquer allongent ces mesures d’une semaine (j’insiste : allongent, et non simplement décalent). Dans l’hypothèse (plus réaliste) où les mesures sont un peu moins efficaces, chaque semaine d’attente augmente la durée des mesures d’un peu plus d’une semaine.</p>
<p>Il est donc toujours préférable d’agir dès que R&gt;1, de façon à agir le moins longtemps possible, et non pas d’attendre que le nombre de cas augmente considérablement. La seule justification possible à l’attente pourrait être une vaccination massive qui laisserait espérer une décroissance de l’épidémie par l’immunisation, ce qui n’est manifestement pas le cas dans l’immédiat.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology/">What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/what-role-does-culture-play-in-shaping-childrens-school-experiences/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-15-08_54_05-Window-744x286.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>One way to think of culture is as a context in which we learn and develop. We share, live, perform, and experience culture through our participation in daily activities, customs, and routines with social others. Culture helps us make sense of our social worlds and shapes our actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, culture plays a role in the way we experience emotions, construct our self-concepts, and learn and problem-solve.</p><p>With increasing migration and the movement of people in the twenty-first century, many children in the US and worldwide are attending school in formal settings where cultural norms and practices at home may conflict with those children encounter at school. This experience places children in the position of having to navigate two different social worlds—home and school. One broad question we can explore is: “what role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences and academic success?” Let’s visit three specific areas: parental beliefs and socialization practices, teacher perceptions, and school curricula and children’s learning.</p><h2>Parental beliefs and socialization practices</h2><p>Parental expectations, beliefs, and attitudes about education shape children’s academic experiences. Many parents in diverse cultural communities view education as a path to future success. For example, as a group many Asian and Asian American children attain academic success. What role does culture play in these outcomes? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=l4wwBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Understanding+Taiwanese+children%E2%80%99s+play+via+constructing+and+reconstructing:+a+prospective+vision&amp;ots=s3ofAeiKoG&amp;sig=ocrn2krrERVpHnGg2WA_A4j09bI#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Taiwanese%20children%E2%80%99s%20play%20via%20constructing%20and%20reconstructing%3A%20a%20prospective%20vision&amp;f=false">Chang</a> notes that as a group, Chinese and Taiwanese parents place a high value on education. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590544000068">Kim and Park</a>  note the same is true for Korean parents. Parenting approaches in these communities highlight training and disciplining children, parent self-sacrifice, and devotion to children. Parents believe perseverance and hard work is the key to success and socialization practices reinforce these values and traits. These cultural practices help children internalize the values their parents place upon education and behaving according to social norms. Children acquire these values and are loyal, appreciative, and dedicated to their parents for their support and encouragement. In part, they attain academic success to honor their parents and the broader social groups to which they belong.</p><h2>Teacher perceptions</h2><p>Teachers play an important role in children’s academic success too. What practices work best to motivate children to do well at school? The answer depends upon numerous factors. For example, many teachers will be entrusted with educating children who may not share their cultural heritage. How might this cultural mismatch shape children’s school experiences and potential for academic success?</p><p>Most American school practices reflect dominant, mainstream American values, norms, and behavioral scripts. For most European American children who value independence and uniqueness, teacher praise and rewards can be highly motivating. However, for children who come from families that value humility and modesty, receiving praise in front of classmates might be an uncomfortable interaction.</p><p>Student engagement norms are another example. Many American teachers using a mainstream cultural lens, connect active student engagement with student attentiveness. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/331021">Yamamoto and Li</a>noted that for many Asian and Asian American students, knowing when to be quiet is a desirable skill which caregivers socialize their children to acquire. Teachers using mainstream, American cultural values and norms may perceive quiet students as disengaged and inattentive. These perceptions impact children’s motivation to learn and academic success.</p><h2>School curricula and children’s learning</h2><p>Dominant, mainstream American values tend to permeate curricular and teaching practices. Many American schools promote individual learning and problem-solving approaches rather than group or collaborative problem-solving strategies. The focus upon individualized learning connects to the cultural ideology of individualism and the independent self. These approaches promote the self as separate and unique from social others. Many European American children participate in cultural practices and routines that reinforce this worldview and values.</p><p>However, many Latinx and indigenous children participate in cultural practices and activities at home that value group and collaborative problem solving. These practices connect to the cultural ideology of collectivism and the interdependent self. At home children participate in practices and routines that emphasize the importance of the group, especially family. Thus, there is a disconnect between the approaches at home with the practices and routines the child encounters at school. Consequently, many of these children often have difficulty reaching their maximum potential in classrooms that promote individual problem-solving skills. Why does this happen and does this necessarily have be the outcome?</p><p>For many children from cultural heritages that promote collectivist values and an interdependent cultural model of the self, the cultural practices in which the child participates at home may conflict with those the child encounters at school. Often, teachers are unaware of these sources of conflict. However, this conflict between home and school does not need to impede students’ success or invalidate the child’s cultural heritage. One solution is for schools to meet students halfway and bridge the gap between the two contexts.</p><p>Two fine examples are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/resources/bridging-cultures-in-our-schools-new-approaches-that-work-knowledge-brief/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a> designed to assist immigrant and indigenous children in the US and the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351237109/chapters/10.4324/9781351237109-2">Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP)</a> designed to assist native Hawaiian children. Both programs highlight how helping teachers become more aware, respectful, accepting, and inclusive of all their students’ cultural values and goals shapes children’s motivation and academic success at school.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Numerous cultural forces connect to children’s school experiences and academic achievement. These include parental beliefs, socialization practices, and cultural worldviews. Cultural values, practices, and ways of learning at home both shape and connect to children’s formal school experiences. Educational initiatives such as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/project/bridging-cultures-project/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a>  and KEEP highlight the importance of cultural compatibility and connectedness in fostering children’s active engagement in school. Acknowledging and incorporating cultural knowledge, patterns, and ways of learning at home when they disconnect with those at school is one important way to ensure all children’s academic success.</p><p><em>Featured image: School children in India, by Richard Veit</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/644350254/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2f2021-02-15-08_54_05-Window-744x286.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/the-case-for-readdressing-the-three-paradigms-of-basic-astrophysics/">The case for readdressing the three paradigms of basic astrophysics</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/shakespeare-and-the-sciences-of-emotion/">Shakespeare and the sciences of emotion</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/12/restoration-of-the-daily-email-announcement/">Restoration of the Daily Email Announcement</a></h4>

              
                <p>Subscribers to arXiv’s daily email announcement recently experienced a disruption in service. Maintenance performed by arXiv’s email provider was found to be the cause of the disruption. The issue has been resolved, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>During this time, functionality on arXiv.org remained intact. Readers and authors could continue to browse and download new papers on arXiv.org, as well as submit their own articles.</p>
<p><b>The issue</b></p>
<p>Daily emails announcing new papers were received late, or not at all. Other emails, such as account registration confirmations, were also affected.</p>
<p><b>The response</b></p>
<p>We first identified and fixed a problem related to the email disruption, and began sending the email backlog to subscribers. Soon after that process began, another issue was identified that inadvertently truncated subscriber lists, specific to several subject areas. Finally, the distribution lists for all subject areas were restored and remaining announcements were sent.</p>
<p>Moving forward, if any subscribers find that the daily announcement email is not received, we advise them <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">to resubscribe</a>.</p>
<p><b>Remediation </b></p>
<p>We know that researchers rely on the daily announcement for their work, and we aim to avoid such disruptions in the future by:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Automating daily backups of the distribution lists</li>
<li aria-level="1">Applying fixes to prevent the root cause</li>
<li aria-level="1">Improving the monitoring of the daily email announcement systems</li>
<li aria-level="1">Reviewing our overall backup and recovery plans</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we resolved the issue and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
