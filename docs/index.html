              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/albatross-bird-divorce-ocean-warm-breeding-climate">Albatrosses divorce more often when ocean waters warm</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to fidelity, birds fit the bill: Over 90 percent of all bird species are monogamous and — mostly — stay faithful, perhaps none more famously than the majestic albatross. Albatross couples rarely separate, sticking with the same breeding partner year after year. But when ocean waters are warmer than average, more of the birds split up, a new study finds.</p>



<p>In years when the water was warmer than usual, the divorce rate — typically less than 4 percent on average — rose to nearly 8 percent among albatrosses in part of the Falkland Islands, researchers report November 24 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. It’s <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">the first evidence that the environment</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">, not just breeding failure,</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112"> affects divorce in wild birds</a>. In fact, the team found that during warmer years, even some females that had bred successfully ditched their partners.<a></a></p>



<p>The result suggests that as the climate changes as a result of human activity, higher instances of divorce in albatrosses and perhaps other socially monogamous animals may be “an overlooked consequence,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albatrosses can live for decades, sometimes spending years out on the ocean searching for food and returning to land only to breed. Pairs that stay together have the benefits of familiarity and improved coordination, which help when raising young. This stability is particularly important in dynamic, marine environments, says Francesco Ventura, a conservation biologist at the University of Lisbon in Portugal.</p>





<p><a></a>But if breeding doesn’t work out, many birds — mostly females — leave their partner and try to find better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/when-birds-divorce">luck elsewhere</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/98</em>). Breeding is more likely to fail in years with more difficult conditions, with knock-on effects on divorce rates the following years. Ventura wanted to find out whether the environment also has a direct impact: changing the rate of divorce regardless of whether the breeding had gone well.</p>



<p>Ventura and his team analyzed data collected from 2004 to 2019 on a large colony of black-browed albatrosses (<em>Thalassarche melanophris</em>) living on New Island in the Falkland Islands. The team recorded nearly 2,900 breeding attempts in 424 females, and tracked bird breakups. Then, accounting for previous breeding success in individual pairs, the researchers checked to see if environmental conditions had any noticeable further impact on pairings.</p>



<p>Breeding failure, especially early on, was still the main factor behind a divorce: Each female lays just a single egg, and those birds whose eggs didn’t hatch were over five times as likely to separate from their partners as those who succeeded, or those whose hatched chicks didn’t survive. In some years, the divorce rate was lower than 1 percent.</p>



<p>Yet this rate increased in line with average water temperatures, reaching a maximum of 7.7 percent in 2017 when waters were the warmest. The team’s calculations revealed that the probability of divorce was correlated with rising temperatures. And surprisingly, females in successful breeding pairs were more likely to be affected by the harsher environment than males or females that either didn’t breed, or failed. When ocean temperatures dropped again in 2018 and 2019, so did divorce rates.</p>



<p>Warmer water means fewer nutrients, so some birds may be fueling up out at sea for longer, delaying their return to the colony or turning up bedraggled and unappealing. If members of pairs return at different times, this <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/separate-vacations-birds-winter-apart-return-sync">can lead to breakups</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/04</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, worse conditions one year might raise stress-related hormones in the birds too, which can affect mate choice. A bird may incorrectly attribute its stress to its partner, rather than the harsher environment, and separate even if hatching was successful, the researchers speculate.</p>



<p>Such misreading between cues and reality could make separation a less-effective behavior, suggests Antica Culina, an evolutionary ecologist at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology in Wageningen who was not involved in the study. If animals divorce for the wrong reason and do worse the following season, that can lead to lower breeding success overall and possibly population decline.</p>



<p>Similar patterns could be found in other socially monogamous animals, including mammals, the researchers suggest. “If you imagine a population with a very low number of breeding pairs &#8230; this might have much more serious repercussions,” Ventura says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you have a partner, how do you think your relationship would fare in the face of a natural disaster? Do you think it would bring you closer — or might the stresses make your relationship worse?</p>



<p>Various studies have explored this, and their conclusions have been mixed. But virtually all have been hampered by a lack of key data: measures of relationship satisfaction actually taken <em>before </em>a disaster (rather than later recalled), to compare with measures of satisfaction afterwards. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211015677">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now plugs this gap. Hannah Williamson at the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report a remarkable study of 231 couples living in Harris County, Texas, using data collected before and after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated the region in August 2017.</p>



<span id="more-44664"></span>



<p>A few years before Harvey struck, the team had enrolled a diverse group of newlyweds for a study of relationship development in the early years. By August 2017, these couples had already individually completed a couples satisfaction survey on three occasions, each about six months apart. The team realised that they had, then, the perfect initial data set for a study of the impact of a natural disaster on couples.</p>



<p>About six, 12 and 18 months after the hurricane, the participants completed the couples satisfaction survey again. They also reported on how badly the hurricane had affected them — whether they’d had to evacuate their home or be rescued, and whether they’d been physically injured, for example. And they reported on levels of chronic stress and social support.</p>



<p>Typically, relationship satisfaction for newlywed couples follows this trajectory: initially, they’re very satisfied, but then both wives and husbands report a gradual and continuous decline over time.</p>



<p>That’s not what these couples experienced.</p>



<p>During the period before the hurricane, yes, they reported a gradual decline (and this was more pronounced for the wives than the husbands). But right after the hurricane, both partners enjoyed a similar leap in relationship satisfaction. This might have been down to going through the disaster together, with a partner who was also a victim, the researchers suggest. Whatever the reason, this longitudinal study certainly suggests that natural disasters tend to bring couples together, rather than drive them apart. But this didn’t last long…</p>



<p>“As the initial impact of the hurricane wore off, so too did the increase in satisfaction,” the team reports. Participants soon reverted to reporting the same rate of gradual decline in satisfaction as before the disaster. As life gradually returned to normal, perhaps previous relationship issues resurfaced, or became trickier to overlook.</p>



<p>There were some interesting extra findings. The size of the satisfaction jump was not related to how badly they were personally affected by Hurricane Harvey, or their levels of chronic stress and social support. But couples who’d reported poorer relationships before the hurricane did tend to report the biggest satisfaction jumps afterwards. However, this might be down to a ceiling effect —&nbsp;the couples who were most satisfied before Harvey struck didn’t have much room for improvement.</p>



<p>There are a few limitations to the work that are worth noting. This study was on newlyweds; perhaps couples who’ve been together for longer wouldn’t have the same experience. Also, the data was of course from one group of US residents living in one location. Still, the group was a close match for the diverse racial and ethnic make-up of people living in poverty in that area, the team notes. And as more disaster-prone regions of the US tend to be home to communities with a similar profile, the researchers argue that they represent a sample of people who are more vulnerable to natural disasters in the US, at least.</p>



<p>Natural disasters — whether hurricanes or wildfires or intense rainfall and flooding — are of course becoming more common, and more severe around the world. For anyone affected, their relationship with their partner is likely to be more important than any other for how they cope. This makes it ever more important to understand what impact disasters have on these relationships.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-milky-way-galaxy-feather-gas-spiral-arms-gangotri-wave">Astronomers have found the Milky Way’s first known ‘feather’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way has a “feather” in its cap.<br><br>A long, thin filament of cold, dense <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac341f">gas extends jauntily from the galactic center, connecting two of the galaxy’s spiral arms</a>, astronomers report November 11 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. This is the first time that such a structure, which looks like the barb of a feather fanning off the central quill, has been spotted in the Milky Way.</p>



<p>The team that discovered our galaxy’s feather named it the Gangotri wave, after the glacier that is the source of India’s longest river, the Ganges. In Hindi and other Indian languages, the Milky Way is called Akasha Ganga, “the river Ganga in the sky,” says astrophysicist Veena V.S. of the University of Cologne in Germany.<br><br>She and colleagues found the Gangotri wave by looking for clouds of cold carbon monoxide gas, which is dense and easy to trace, in data from the <a href="https://www.apex-telescope.org/ns/">APEX telescope</a> in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. The structure stretches 6,000 to 13,000 light-years from the Norma arm of the Milky Way to a minor arm near the galactic center called the 3-kiloparsec arm. So far, all other known gas tendrils in the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-milky-way-could-help-map-galactic-structure">align with the spiral arms</a> (<em>SN: 12/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Gangotri wave has another unusual feature: waviness. The filament appears to wobble up and down like a sine wave over the course of thousands of light-years. Astronomers aren’t sure what could cause that, Veena says.</p>



<p>Other galaxies have gaseous plumage, but when it comes to the Milky Way, “it’s very, very difficult” to map the galaxy’s structure from the inside out, she says. She hopes to find more galactic feathers and other bits of our galaxy’s structure. “One by one, we’ll be able to map the Milky Way.”</p>

                The University of Glasgow is “in discussions to retract” seven papers by a pharmacology researcher who worked there for more than 25 years, after it learned of allegations on PubPeer by pseudonymous whistleblower Clare Francis. The development confirms reporting by Retraction Watch earlier this month.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kamooalewa-moon-space-rock-quasisatellite">A space rock called Kamoʻoalewa may be a piece of the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>The moon’s violent history is written across its face. Over billions of years, space rocks have punched craters into its surface, flinging out debris. Now, for the first time, astronomers may have spotted rubble from one of those ancient smashups out in space. The mysterious object known as Kamoʻoalewa appears to be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00303-7">stray fragment of the moon</a>, researchers report online November 11 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Discovered in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-has-tiny-tagalong-and-no-its-not-moon">Kamoʻoalewa — also known as 2016 HO3</a> — is one of Earth’s five known quasisatellites (<em>SN: 6/24/16</em>). These are rocks that stick fairly close to the planet as they orbit the sun. Little is known about Earth’s space rock entourage because these objects are so small and faint. Kamoʻoalewa, for instance, is about the size of a Ferris wheel and strays between 40 and 100 times as far from Earth as the moon, as its orbit around the sun weaves in and out of Earth’s. That has left astronomers to wonder about the nature of such tagalong rocks.</p>



<p>“An object in a quasisatellite orbit is interesting because it’s very difficult to get into this kind of orbit — it’s not the kind of orbit that an object from the asteroid belt could easily find itself caught in,” says Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at MIT not involved in the new work. Having an orbit nearly identical to Earth’s immediately raises suspicions that an object like Kamoʻoalewa originated in the Earth-moon system, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers used the Large Binocular Telescope and the Lowell Discovery Telescope, in Safford and Happy Jack, Ariz., respectively, to peer at Kamoʻoalewa in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. “The real money is in the infrared,” says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Light at those wavelengths contains important clues about the minerals in rocky bodies, helping distinguish objects such as the moon, asteroids and terrestrial planets.</p>





<p>Kamoʻoalewa reflected more sunlight at longer, or redder, wavelengths. This pattern of light, or spectrum, looked unlike any known near-Earth asteroid, Reddy and colleagues found. But it did look like grains of silicate rock from the moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/back-moon-sample-tests-begin">brought back to Earth</a> by Apollo 14 astronauts (<em>SN: 2/20/71</em>).</p>

<p>Kamoʻoalewa, also known as 2016 HO3, has an orbit (white) that is nearly identical to Earth’s (blue), causing the object to weave around Earth as it circles the sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To me,” Binzel says, “the leading hypothesis is that it’s an ejected fragment from the moon, from a cratering event.”</p>



<p>Martin Connors, who was involved in the discovery of Earth’s first known quasisatellites but did not participate in the new research, also suspects that Kamoʻoalewa is a chip off the old moon. “This is well-founded evidence,” says Connors, a planetary scientist at Athabasca University in Canada. But, he cautions, “that doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>



<p>More detailed observations could help confirm Kamoʻoalewa is made of moon stuff. “If you really wanted to put that nail in the coffin, you’d want to go and visit, or rendezvous with this little quasisatellite and take a lot of up-close observations,” says Daniel Scheeres, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder not involved in the work. “The best would be to get a sample.”</p>



<p>China&#8217;s space agency <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1045.pdf">has announced plans</a> to send a probe to Kamoʻoalewa to scoop up a bit of rock and bring it back to Earth later this decade.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/22/body-maps-reveal-the-range-of-sensations-and-feelings-experienced-during-hallucinations/">Body Maps Reveal The Range Of Sensations And Feelings Experienced During Hallucinations</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Most research into hallucinations focuses on unimodal hallucinations — hallucinatory experiences that only affect one sensory modality, such as hearing or touch. But for decades there has been evidence that multimodal hallucinations (which affect more than one sense at once) may be quite common. One of the main challenges in investigating them, however, has been capturing and communicating the wide array of features that comprise multimodal experiences.</p>



<p>However, thanks to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00433-8/fulltext">new research</a> in <em>EClinicalMedicine </em>from Katie Melvin and colleagues at the University of Leicester, this may be about to change. To improve our understanding of the feelings and sensations associated with hallucinations, the team gathered a group of participants to create what they dubbed MUSE maps — visual and written representations of what hallucinations feel like throughout (and around) the body. Not only do their findings suggest that most hallucinations seem to have emotional and multisensory components, but their new method offers a more intuitive way to communicate and understand hallucinatory experiences.</p>



<span id="more-44655"></span>



<p>For their study, the team recruited twelve participants who were experiencing hallucinations daily and had been given psychotic-spectrum diagnoses. For one week, these participants kept a visual diary documenting the feelings and modalities associated with their hallucinations.</p>



<p>In the diary entries, participants were encouraged to write and sketch about the details of their hallucinatory experiences. Each day’s diary page contained a tick-box list of modalities that were involved in hallucinations, free text boxes in which to write about the feelings and sensations associated with them, and a body-map to indicate which feelings were experienced in which parts of the body. The participants could use any medium to express the lived experience of their hallucinations, though all ultimately chose to provide their input using pen or pencil. The data gathered from these diaries were collectively referred to as multimodal unusual sensory experience (MUSE) maps. Finally, when the week was over, the participants came into a clinic to further discuss each of their MUSE maps in a 30-minute interview with the primary researcher.</p>



<p>The participants reported a wide range of hallucinatory experiences, such as auditory or gustatory hallucinations, all the way through to disruptions in the feeling of time. All participants shared that they experienced bodily feelings and sensations as co-occurring with hallucinations, and provided detailed schematic illustrations of their experiences on the body map templates provided (several of which are reproduced in the published article). Though some favoured words and arrows pointing to various points of the body, others took a more intuitive and artistic approach, illustrating waves of sensations with lines, sectioned bodies, broken hearts, and literally weighted limbs.</p>

From <em><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00433-8/fulltext">Melvin et al (2021)</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Generally speaking, although hallucinations are typically thought of as unimodal experiences, 10 of the 12 participants in this study shared that many of their experiences were multimodal, regularly crossing emotional and sensory boundaries. Each participant typically experienced recurring sensations in particular areas of their body during hallucinations in different modalities, including feelings of pain, heat, or tension.</p>



<p>Analysis of written responses revealed 106 terms pertaining to feelings during hallucinations. The authors found that these divided into four main groups. All but one participant used <em>emotional language</em>, and most of the emotions were negative (eg. fear, powerlessness), with positive emotions only being reported in the minority of cases. Words pertaining to <em>feelings of knowing</em> were employed by half of the participants, who reported a wide range of feelings from boredom all the way to being alert during hallucinatory experiences. <em>Feelings of reality</em> being affected, such as feeling a presence, paranoia, or disorientation, were reported by almost all participants. Participants also reported <em>bodily feelings</em>, such as tiredness or heaviness.</p>



<p>Taken together, this data clearly illustrates that many hallucinations are in fact multimodal, are commonly associated with bodily sensations, and are often accompanied by unpleasant emotional responses. The exploratory nature of MUSE maps, however, does mean that this approach has some limitations. For example, the team highlights that MUSE maps may miss some pertinent sensations, in part because participants themselves decide which sensations are relevant to report, without too much prompting. Body maps including a back view, as opposed to just the front view used in this study, would also be necessary in future studies. In addition, the low sample size of this research may have failed to capture some aspects of multimodal hallucination experiences, or indeed issues with the MUSE map method. As such, future research looking at expanding the sample size and diversity is needed.</p>



<p>Even so, these findings echo contemporary research into hallucinations which suggests that multimodal experiences are common, if considerably harder to communicate. This extra layer of difficulty may have led to the general assumption that unimodal hallucinations are more prevalent. But, the authors say, tools such as MUSE maps may help to close this gap in understanding. The extent of hallucinatory experiences illustrated by the MUSE maps in this study suggest that clinicians may wish to consider broadening their assumptions on whether hallucinations are likely to be unimodal, and perhaps even consider modifying their clinical environment to be more comfortable for those with disturbances across multiple senses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-atom-light-pauli-exclusion-principle">Scientists finally detected a quantum effect that blocks atoms from scattering light</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cloud of ultracold atoms is like a motel with a neon “no vacancy” sign.</p>



<p>If a guest at the motel wants to switch rooms, they’re out of luck. No vacant rooms means there’s no choice but to stay put. Likewise, in new experiments, atoms boxed in by crowded conditions have no way to switch up their quantum states. That constraint means the atoms don’t scatter light as they normally would, three teams of researchers report in the Nov. 19 <em>Science</em>. Predicted more than three decades ago, this effect has now been seen for the first time.</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, atoms interact readily with light. Shine a beam of light on a cloud of atoms, and they’ll scatter some of that light in all directions. This type of light scattering is a common phenomenon: It happens in Earth’s atmosphere. “We see the sky as blue because of scattered radiation from the sun,” says Yair Margalit, who was part of the team at MIT that performed one of the experiments.</p>



<p>But quantum physics comes to the fore in ultracold, dense atom clouds. “The way they interact with light or scatter light is different,” says physicist Amita Deb of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, a coauthor of another of the studies.</p>





<p>According to a rule called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-exploit-quantum-rule-create-new-pauli-crystal">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, atoms in the experiments can’t take on the same quantum state — namely, they can’t have the same momentum as another atom in the experiment (<em>SN: 5/19/20</em>). If atoms are packed together in a dense cloud and cooled to near absolute zero, they&#8217;ll settle into the lowest-energy quantum states. Those low-energy states will be entirely filled, like a motel with no open rooms.</p>



<p>When an atom scatters light, it gets a kick of momentum, changing its quantum state, as it sends light off in another direction. But if the atom can’t change its state due to the crowded conditions, it won’t scatter the light. The atom cloud becomes more transparent, letting light through instead of scattering it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To observe the effect, Margalit and colleagues beamed light through <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi6153">a cloud of lithium atoms</a>, measuring the amount of light it scattered. Then, the team decreased the temperature to make the atoms fill up the lowest energy states, suppressing the scattering of light. As the temperature dropped, the atoms scattered 37 percent less light, indicating that many atoms were prevented from scattering light. (Some atoms can still scatter light, for example if they get kicked into higher-energy quantum states that are unoccupied.)</p>



<p>In another experiment, physicist Christian Sanner of the research institute JILA in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues studied <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3483">a cloud of ultracold strontium atoms</a>. The researchers measured how much light was scattered at small angles, for which the atoms are jostled less by the light and therefore are even less likely to be able to find an unoccupied quantum state. At lower temperatures, the atoms scattered half as much light as at higher temperatures.</p>



<p>The third experiment, performed by Deb and physicist Niels Kjærgaard, also of the University of Otago, measured a similar scattering drop in an <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3470">ultracold potassium atom cloud</a> and a corresponding increase in how much light was transmitted through the cloud.</p>



<p>Because the Pauli exclusion principle also governs how electrons, protons and neutrons behave, it is responsible for the structure of atoms and matter as we know it. These new results reveal the wide-ranging principle in a new context, says Sanner. “It’s fascinating because it shows a very fundamental principle in nature at work.”</p>



<p>The work also suggests new ways to control light and atoms. “One could imagine a lot of interesting applications,” says theoretical physicist Peter Zoller of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, who was not involved with the research. In particular, light scattering is closely related to a process called spontaneous emission, in which an atom in a high-energy state decays to a lower energy by emitting light. The results suggest that decay could be blocked, increasing the lifetime of the energetic state. Such a technique might be useful for storing quantum information for a lengthier period of time than is normally possible, for example in a quantum computer.</p>



<p>So far, these applications are still theoretical, Zoller says. “How realistic they are is something to be explored in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>There’s a widespread belief that eating cheese before bed can give you weird dreams. </strong>But there’s no evidence that this is true, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211117-does-cheese-really-give-you-vivid-dreams">writes Jessica Brown</a> at <em>BBC Future</em>. The belief may have arisen from the fact that cheese is sometimes eaten as the last course of a meal, and eating late at night can disrupt our sleep.</p>

<p><strong>In English, we tend to pair nonsense words like “bouba” with round shapes, and words like “kiki” with spiky ones. But now researchers have found that this phenomenon is common across many different languages and writing systems, </strong><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nonsense-words-make-people-around-world-think-same-shapes"><strong>reports Cathleen O’Grady</strong></a><strong> at <em>Science</em>. </strong>The research suggests that as spoken language evolved, the sounds of words may have corresponded in some ways to their meaning.</p>

<p><strong>We think of self-control as a human trait —</strong> <strong>but it has also been observed in birds, <a href="https://theconversation.com/birds-feeding-habits-are-affected-by-their-personality-and-self-control-new-research-171780">write researchers John Quinn and Jenny Coomes</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. </strong>The pair found that great tits who displayed better self-control were also better at adapting their foraging behaviour to suit the situation, for instance. They also found links between personality and foraging behaviour: the birds who showed a tendency to explore new environments also took more risks in order to get to a better food source.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, there has been a rise in Tourette-like tics among young women, and some researchers believe that the phenomenon is linked to exposure to influencers on TikTok and other platforms, coupled with the stress of the pandemic. </strong>But that doesn’t mean that these tics aren&#8217;t real, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/16/the-unknown-is-scary-why-young-women-on-social-media-are-developing-tourettes-like-tics">writes Sirin Kale</a> at <em>The Guardian</em>, and many young people suffering from the condition are struggling to get the mental health support they need.</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, the World Health Organization released the 11th revision of its International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), which included “gaming disorder” as an addictive behaviour</strong>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-projections-2500">How climate change may shape the world in the centuries to come</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s hard to imagine what Earth might look like in 2500. But a collaboration between science and art is offering an unsettling window into how ongoing climate change might transform now-familiar terrain into alien landscapes over the next few centuries.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15871">visualizations</a> — of U.S. Midwestern farms overtaken by subtropical plants, of a dried-up Amazon rainforest, of extreme heat baking the Indian subcontinent — emphasize why researchers need to push climate projections long past the customary benchmark of 2100, environmental social scientist Christopher Lyon and colleagues contend September 24 in <em>Global Change Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Fifty years have passed since the first climate projections, which set that distant target at 2100, says Lyon, of McGill University in Montreal. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">that date isn’t so far off anymore</a>, and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions emitted in the past and present will linger for centuries (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>To visualize what that future world might look like, the researchers considered three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">possible climate trajectories</a> — low, moderate and high emissions as used in past reports by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — and projected changes all the way out to 2500 (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). The team focused particularly on impacts on civilization: heat stress, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changing-climate-could-worsen-foods-nutrition">failing crops</a> and changes in land use and vegetation (<em>SN: 3/13/17</em>).</p>





<p>For all but the lowest-emission scenario, which is roughly in line with limiting global warming to “well under” 2 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">approved by the 2015 Paris Agreement</a>, the average global temperature continues to increase until 2500, the team found (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). For the highest-emissions scenario, temperatures increase by about 2.2 degrees C by 2100 and by about 4.6 degrees C by 2500. That results in “major restructuring of the world’s biomes,” the researchers say: loss of most of the Amazon rainforest, poleward shifts in crops and unlivable temperatures in the tropics.</p>



<p>The team then collaborated with James McKay, an artist and science communicator at the University of Leeds in England, to bring the data to life. Based on the study’s projections, McKay created a series of detailed paintings representing different global landscapes now and in 2500.</p>



<p>The team stopped short of trying to speculate on future technologies or cities to keep the paintings based more in realism than science fiction, Lyon says. “But we did want to showcase things people would recognize: drones, robotics, hybrid plants.” In one painting of India in 2500, a person is wearing a sealed suit and helmet, a type of garment that people in some high-heat environments might wear today, he says.</p>



<p>The goal of these images is to help people visualize the future in such a way that it feels more urgent, real and close — and, perhaps, to offer a bit of hope that humans can still adapt. “If we’re changing on a planetary scale, we need to think about this problem as a planetary civilization,” Lyon says. “We wanted to show that, despite the climate people have moved into, people have figured out ways to exist in the climate.”</p>

<h3>2000 vs. 2500</h3>



<p> High greenhouse gas emissions could increase average global temperatures by about 4.6 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times. As a result, extreme heat in India could dramatically alter how humans live in the environment. Farmers and herders, shown in 2000 the painting at left, may require protective clothing such as a cooling suit and helmet to work outdoors by 2500, as shown in the painting at right. </p>

<p>If greenhouse gas emissions remain high, the U.S. Midwest&#8217;s &#8220;breadbasket&#8221; farms, as seen below in 2000 in the painting at left, could be transformed into subtropical agroforestry regions by 2500, researchers say. The region might be dotted with some versions of oil palms and succulents, as envisioned in the painting at right, and rely on water capture and irrigation devices to offset extreme summer heat. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">A new map shows where carbon needs to stay in nature to avoid climate disaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over decades, centuries and millennia, the steady skyward climb of redwoods, the tangled march of mangroves along tropical coasts and the slow submersion of carbon-rich soil in peatlands has locked away billions of tons of carbon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If these natural vaults get busted open, through deforestation or dredging of swamplands, it would take centuries before those redwoods or mangroves could grow back to their former fullness and reclaim all that carbon. Such carbon is “irrecoverable” on the timescale — decades, not centuries — needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and keeping it locked away is crucial.</p>



<p>Now, through a new mapping project, scientists have estimated how much irrecoverable carbon resides in peatlands, mangroves, forests and elsewhere around the globe — and which areas need protection.</p>



<p>The new estimate puts the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00803-6">total amount of irrecoverable carbon at 139 gigatons</a>, researchers report November 18 in <em>Nature Sustainability.</em> That’s equivalent to about 15 years of human carbon dioxide emissions at current levels. And if all that carbon were released, it’s almost certainly enough to push the planet past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels.</p>





<p>“This is the carbon we must protect to avert climate catastrophe,” says Monica Noon, an environmental data scientist at Conservation International in Arlington, Va. Current efforts to keep global warming<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">&nbsp;below the ambitious target of 1.5 degrees C</a>&nbsp;require that we reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and that carbon stored in nature stays put (<em>SN:12/17/18</em>).&nbsp;But agriculture and other development pressures threaten some of these carbon stores.</p>



<p>To map this at-risk carbon, Noon and her colleagues combined satellite data with estimates of how much total carbon is stored in ecosystems vulnerable to human incursion. The researchers excluded areas like permafrost, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">stores lots of carbon</a> but isn’t likely to be developed (although it’s thawing due to warming), as well as tree plantations, which have already been altered (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). The researchers then calculated how much carbon would get released from land conversions, such as clearing a forest for farmland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That land might store varying amounts of carbon, depending on whether it becomes a palm oil plantation or a parking lot. To simplify, the researchers assumed cleared land was left alone, with saplings free to grow where giants once stood. That allowed the researchers to estimate how long it might take for the released carbon to be reintegrated into the land. Much of that carbon would remain in the air by 2050, the team reports, as many of these ecosystems take centuries to return to their former glory, rendering it irrecoverable on a timescale that matters for addressing climate change.</p>

<h3>Carbon-rich lands</h3>



<p>Researchers mapped the location and density of Earth’s irrecoverable carbon — carbon locked in ecosystems that is potentially vulnerable to release from human development and, if lost, could not be restored to those ecosystems by 2050. Areas of exceptionally high density of irrecoverable carbon (purple) include the Pacific Northwest, the Amazon, the Congo Basin and Borneo.</p>

<p>Releasing that 139 gigatons of irrecoverable carbon could have irrevocable consequences. For comparison, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that humans can emit only 109 more gigatons of carbon to have a two-thirds chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C. “These are the places we absolutely have to protect,” Noon says.</p>



<p>Approximately half of this irrecoverable carbon sits on just 3.3 percent of Earth’s total land area, equivalent to roughly the area of India and Mexico combined. Key areas are in the Amazon, the Pacific Northwest, and the tropical forests and mangroves of Borneo. “The fact that it’s so concentrated means we can protect it,” Noon says.</p>



<p>Roughly half of irrecoverable carbon already falls within existing protected areas or lands managed by Indigenous peoples. Adding an additional 8 million square kilometers of protected area, which is only about 5.4 percent of the planet’s land surface, would bring 75 percent of this carbon under some form of protection, Noon says.</p>



<p>“It’s really important to have spatially explicit maps of where these irrecoverable carbon stocks are,” says Kate Dooley, a geographer at the University of Melbourne in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a small percentage globally, but it’s still a lot of land.” Many of these dense stores are in places at high risk of development, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s so hard to stop this drive of deforestation,” she says, but these maps will help focus the efforts of governments, civil society groups and academics on the places that matter most for the climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-mass-binary-system-carbon-factories-space">How massive stars in binary systems turn into carbon factories</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next time you thank your lucky stars, you might want to bless the binaries. New calculations indicate that a massive star whose outer layer gets torn off by a companion star ends up shedding a lot more carbon than if the star had been born a loner.</p>



<p>“That star is making about twice as much carbon as a single star would make,” says Rob Farmer, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany.</p>



<p>All life on Earth is based on carbon, the fourth most abundant element in the cosmos, after hydrogen, helium and oxygen. Like nearly every chemical element heavier than helium, carbon is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">formed in stars</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). For many elements, astronomers have been able to pin down the main source. For example, oxygen comes almost entirely from massive stars, most of which explode, while nitrogen is made mostly in lower-mass stars, which don’t explode. In contrast, carbon arises both in massive and lower-mass stars. Astronomers would like to know exactly which types of stars forged the lion’s share of this vital element.</p>



<p>Farmer and his colleagues looked specifically at massive stars, which are at least eight times heavier than the sun, and calculated how they behave with and without partners. Nuclear reactions at the core of a massive star first turn hydrogen into helium. When the core runs out of hydrogen, the star expands, and soon the core starts converting helium into carbon.</p>





<p>But massive stars usually have companion stars, adding a twist to the storyline: When the star expands, the companion’s gravity can tear off the larger star’s outer envelope, exposing the helium core. That allows freshly minted carbon to stream into space via a flow of particles.</p>



<p>“In these very massive stars, these winds are quite strong,” Farmer says. For instance, his team’s calculations indicate that the wind of a star born 40 times as massive as the sun with a close companion ejects 1.1 solar masses of carbon before dying. In comparison, a single star born with the same mass <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04131">ejects just 0.2 solar masses worth of carbon</a>, the researchers report in a paper submitted to arXiv.org October 8 and in press at the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>If the massive star then explodes, it also can outperform a supernova from a solo massive star. That’s because, when the companion star removes the massive star’s envelope, the helium core shrinks. This contraction leaves some carbon behind, outside the core. As a result, nuclear reactions can’t convert that carbon into heavier elements such as oxygen, leaving more carbon to be cast &nbsp;into space by the explosion. Had the star been single, the core would have destroyed much of that carbon.</p>



<p>By analyzing the output from massive stars of different masses, Farmer’s team concludes that the average massive star in a binary ejects 1.4 to 2.6 times as much carbon through winds and supernova explosions as the average massive star that’s single.</p>



<p>Given how many massive stars are in binaries, astronomer Stan Woosley says emphasizing binary-star evolution, as the researchers have done, is helpful in pinning down the origin of a crucial element. But “I think they are making too strong a claim based on models that may be sensitive to uncertain physics,” says Woosley, of the University of California, Santa Cruz. In particular, he says, mass-loss rates for massive stars are not known well enough to assert a specific difference in carbon production between single and binary stars.</p>



<p>Farmer acknowledges the uncertainty, but “the overall picture is sound,” he says. “The binaries are making more [carbon].”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glitter-eco-friendly-green-alternative-cellulose-plant-color">This eco-friendly glitter gets its color from plants, not plastic</a></h4>

              
                <p>All that glitters is not green. Glitter and shimmery pigments are often made using toxic compounds or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-microplastics-travel-far-wind">pollutive microplastics</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). That makes the sparkly stuff, notoriously difficult to clean up in the house, a scourge on the environment too.</p>



<p>A new, nontoxic, biodegradable alternative could change that. In the material, cellulose — the main building block of plant cell walls — creates nanoscale patterns that give rise to vibrant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-ink-printer-butterflies-color-spectrum-microscale-pattern">structural colors</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/21</em>). Such <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01135-8">a material</a> could be used to make eco-friendly glitter and shiny pigments for paints, cosmetics or packaging, researchers report November 11 in <em>Nature Materials</em>.</p>



<p>The inspiration to harness cellulose came from the African plant <em>Pollia condensata</em>, which produces bright, iridescent blue fruits called marble berries. Tiny patterns of cellulose fibers in the berries’ cell walls reflect specific wavelengths of light to create the signature hue. “I thought, if the plants can make it, we should be able to make it,” says chemist Silvia Vignolini of the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vignolini and colleagues whipped up a watery mixture containing cellulose fibers and poured it onto plastic. As the liquid dried into a film, the rodlike fibers settled into helical structures resembling spiral staircases. Tweaking factors such as the steepness of those staircases changed which wavelengths of light the cellulose arrangements reflected, and therefore the color of the film.</p>



<p>That allowed the researchers, like fairy-tale characters spinning straw into gold, to transform their clear, plant-based slurry into meter-long shimmery ribbons in a rainbow of colors. These swaths could then be peeled off their plastic platform and ground up to make glitter.</p>

<p>“You can use any type of cellulose,” Vignolini says. Her team used cellulose from wood pulp, but could have used fruit peels or cotton fibers left over from textile production.</p>



<p>The researchers need to test the environmental impacts of their newfangled glitter. But Vignolini is optimistic that materials using such natural ingredients have a bright future.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do we change beliefs that are contrary to the scientific consensus? Given that such misperceptions can be harmful to the believers, their families, and even to broader society, research in this area is vital. Now Aart van Stekelenburg at Radboud University and colleagues report preliminary but promising work finding that a brief training exercise on the value of scientific consensus, and how to look for it, can help. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211007788">Their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> suggests that this could be a more effective approach than just communicating what the scientific consensus is — at least, for some false beliefs.</p>



<span id="more-44614"></span>



<p>For one of their studies, the team recruited 854 US-based participants who all believed that genetically engineered food is worse for our health than non-GM food. Some participants were given an infographic that explained how a scientific consensus develops and why it’s very useful in deciding whether or not a new claim is likely to be true. It also provided a three-step guide to evaluating a new claim (as might be found in a news article, say):</p>



<ul><li>Look for a statement indicating consensus</li><li>Check the source making the consensus statement</li><li>Evaluate the expertise of the consensus</li></ul>



<p>The training also included a short practice session, with feedback on how to apply these steps.</p>



<p>These participants, plus another group who were not given this three-step guide, read a 2017 news article from <em>Science</em> about a new fungus-resistant, genetically engineered banana. For some participants, the article mentioned that a survey had found that 92% of &#8220;working PhD biomedical scientists&#8221; said that GM food was just as safe to eat as non-GM food. It did, then, communicate the scientific consensus on this topic — and overall, participants who saw this statement felt more positive about GM food than those who did not. But importantly, those in the training group showed even bigger shifts in their beliefs towards the consensus that those who hadn’t received the training. The team argues that the findings represent “extreme evidence in favor of boosting consensus reasoning”, to help correct misperceptions.</p>



<p>However, when the team ran a very similar study on climate change sceptics, they did not get this result; the consensus reasoning training did not change these participants’ belief that current climate change is not primarily down to human action.</p>



<p>There are a few possible reasons for the different results, the team thinks. Trust in climate scientists in the US is relatively low; if you don’t trust the scientists in the first place, you’re presumably less likely to be interested in or swayed by any consensus. Also, the scientific consensus on climate change has been widely highlighted in regular and social media. So it’s possible that this group already knew all about the consensus, and held their beliefs anyway — while perhaps the GM food group started out less aware of the consensus that genetically engineered food is safe, and so were more responsive to the messaging, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Overall, though, there are arguments in favour of boosting consensus reasoning in any case, the team writes. One is this: rather than telling someone what they <em>should</em> believe, the training is designed to “empower individuals to be able to understand and make the best use of the available information regarding a scientific consensus”.</p>



<p>Clearly, this is preliminary research, and the results were mixed. But as what seems to be the first experimental work to test messaging about scientific consensuses among people who hold contrary beliefs, it’s a useful step forwards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">How missing data makes it harder to measure racial bias in policing</a></h4>

              
                <p>From 2012 to 2015, a team of researchers collected 2.9 million police officer patrol records in Chicago. The team’s analysis of that data, from nearly 7,000 officers, showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hispanic-female-police-use-force-less-than-white-male-officers">Black police officers were less likely to arrest</a> civilians than white police officers patrolling the same neighborhood (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/11/21</em>). Officers arrested on average eight people per shift, with Black officers making 24 percent fewer arrests than white officers. But an alternate analysis, one that excluded shifts where no arrests occurred, flipped the results. That made it appear as if Black officers issued 12 percent more arrests than white officers.</p>



<p>Failing to account for events that don’t happen — police allowing a jaywalker to pass, opting not to make an arrest (usually for minor issues like possessing a small amount of drugs) or never firing a drawn gun — is problematic, says policing expert Dean Knox of the University of Pennsylvania. “Instead of drawing the conclusion that minority officers are engaging in less enforcement,” he says of his Chicago study, “you could mistakenly conclude that they are engaging in more enforcement.” &nbsp;The flip occurred because, compared with white officers, Black officers more often went out on patrols without issuing any arrests.</p>



<p>Nonevents of this nature are commonly excluded in policing data. Though a large body of evidence suggests that police in the United States discriminate against Black people, Knox says, many police departments only collect data on a smattering of the interactions between their officers and civilians. Cell phone videos, like those of Eric Garner in a chokehold and George Floyd struggling to breathe,&nbsp;tend to emerge only when encounters have spiraled out of control. That makes it difficult to measure racial bias in policing or come up with targeted solutions to reduce that bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How, though, can researchers studying policing account for nonevents? The laborious Chicago data collection by Knox and his team is not always feasible. And even that rigorous study, reported in <em>Science </em>earlier this year, still had gaps: The team had data on when police stopped, arrested or used force on civilians, but not on minor interactions that didn’t meet the department’s recording requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>When research teams <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm3432">accept these problematic datasets at face value</a>, writes Knox in a November 4 essay in <em>Science, </em>they often arrive at contradictory conclusions. Disagreements in the literature allow public officials and the media to cherry-pick studies that support their viewpoint, whether arguing for or against implicit bias training to overcome unconscious stereotypes or prioritizing the recruitment of minority officers.</p>





<h4>A long chain of events </h4>



<p>Knox wrote the essay following the publication of a controversial, and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877">now retracted</a>, study that appeared in 2019 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> “White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers,” the authors of that study wrote. They concluded that policies aimed at increasing police diversity would do little to stem racial disparities in police killings.</p>



<p>The study gained enormous traction, especially among conservative media outlets and politicians, Knox says. “This was one of the go-to pieces that people use to deny the existence of bias in policing.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the authors’ findings were mathematically baseless, says Knox, who along with Jonathan Mummolo, a policing expert at Princeton University, wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@jon.mummolo/prominent-claims-that-policing-is-not-racially-biased-rest-on-flawed-science-6f66535dc7e5">debunking the study</a> in<em> Medium</em>. Some 800 academics and researchers signed the piece. The team failed to consider total police encounters and then measure what fraction of those encounters resulted in deadly violence, Knox says.</p>

</div>



<p>But that narrow focus on fatal police shootings, a rare occurrence that typically happens at the culmination of a long chain of events, ignores all potential biases earlier in the chain, Knox says. The first potential bias in a chain of events starts with an officer’s decision to approach a civilian or let them pass. Knox acknowledges that&nbsp;a separate layer of research is needed to&nbsp;account for societal level disparities, such as&nbsp;the presence of more officers in&nbsp;Black, often impoverished,&nbsp;neighborhoods and longstanding discriminatory practices that reduce the quality of education and other services in such neighborhoods.</p>



<p>“Even if you can’t see all the things that happened before, just acknowledging they exist is imperative,” Knox says.</p>



<p>Consider this real-life example. On July 10, 2015, Texas state trooper Brian Encinia pulled over Sandra Bland, a Black woman, for failing to signal a lane change. The exchange grew heated and culminated with Encinia arresting Bland for failing to follow orders. Bland’s subsequent death in a county jail caused public outcry.</p>



<p>Focusing solely on Bland’s arrest, and not all that happened before, would provide little information on how Bland wound up in jail for such a minor offense, or how to prevent such an outcome in the future. But because Encinia’s body camera recorded the entire exchange, policing researchers, in this case interested in tone and language, could identify key steps leading up to her arrest. For instance, the researchers reported in <em>Law and Society Review</em> in 2017, Encinia’s <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12265">language starts off polite</a> but becomes increasingly agitated as Bland refuses to comply with his orders. His once formal commands, such as “step out of the car” become informal and unprofessional: “I’m going to yank you out of here.”</p>



<p>That word “yank” indicates that Encinia is losing control of the situation, says Belén Lowrey-Kinberg, a criminologist at St. Francis College in New York City. Previous research has shown that when officers pivot from formal to informal language, violence can follow.</p>



<p>While this is a case study of a single event, the study provides “a great example of how situations can escalate,” says criminologist Justin Nix of the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>



<h4>Fixing flawed data</h4>



<p>Flawed police data does not need to be thrown out, Knox says. His team has developed an algorithm to account for gaps in the data at all points in a police-civilian interaction. The algorithm weights the various possible degrees of discrimination at each point in a chain of events — perhaps race did not factor into Encinia’s decision to pull Bland over because he could not see her face, for example, or maybe race played a large role because most drivers in that area are white. The range of values resulting from the summation of those events suggests the possible amounts of discrimination in any given scenario, Knox says.</p>



<p>The program operates on a very general principle, Knox says. “What are the data that you see?” and “What are the data that you don’t see?”</p>



<p>Thinking about the whole chain of events also points to how to collect better statistics.</p>



<p>Consider a study of police shootings by Nix and policing expert John Shjarback of Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., that appeared November 10 in <em>PLOS One.</em> The researchers were interested in racial disparities in officers’ use of force against Black and white civilians. National databases include only shootings that result in a civilian’s death. But whether someone lives or dies after being shot hinges on several factors, such as proximity to a trauma center, location of the gunshot wound and access to first aid. So researchers sought to examine all police shootings, including those that resulted in injury but not death. To do so, they relied on records from four states — California, Colorado, Florida and Texas — that have collected this information for years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Flawed police data does not need to be thrown out. An algorithm that accounts for gaps in the data operates on a very general principle. “What are the data that you see?” and “What are the data that you don’t see?”</p><cite>Dean Knox, the University of Pennsylvania</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The data revealed that some <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259024">45 percent of victims suffer nonfatal injuries</a>. Factoring in the relative populations of Black and white civilians showed that for all four states, racial disparities in injuries were higher than racial disparities in fatalities. For example, from 2009 to 2014 in Florida, Black people were roughly three times more likely than whites to be shot and killed by police, but over five times more likely to be injured. Across all four states, and for reasons that are not entirely clear, Black victims are 7 percent less likely to die of their injuries than white victims.</p>



<p>National databases that only include records of civilians who die at the hands of the police underestimate officers’ use of deadly force against Black civilians, Nix says. Death “is the end of a very long sequence of events. In our paper we backed up one link in the chain.” That is, the researchers looked at all instances where officers used deadly force and not just those that resulted in death. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Knox is now working with two police departments to break down police-civilian encounters in more detail. Those departments require officers to turn on their body cameras when they believe an interaction with a civilian will rise to the level of an official interaction. (Officers have discretion at this point in the process, Knox acknowledges, so as with the Chicago study, that first link in the chain remains elusive.) Knox and his team will analyze scripts from each encounter for language and tone, such as normal voice or shouting — a quantitative version of the approach Lowrey-Kinberg used to unpack the encounter between Encinia and Bland. Computer vision techniques will parse out gestures, such as “weapon drawn.” Knox says he hopes the data will help his team get closer to reconstructing entire interactions, including identifying nonevents in any given chain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You don’t want just the side of the story as written by an officer,” Knox says. “You want the whole interaction.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atacama-desert-comet-glass-airburst">An ancient exploding comet may explain why glass litters part of Chile</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scattered across a swath of the Atacama Desert in Chile lie twisted chunks of black and green glass. How the glass ended up there, sprinkled along a 75-kilometer-long corridor, has been a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, analyses of space dust in the glass show that the glass probably formed <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G49426.1/609354/Widespread-glasses-generated-by-cometary-fireballs">when a comet, or its remnants, exploded over the desert 12,000 years ago</a>, researchers report November 2 in <em>Geology</em>.</p>



<p>This corridor is the best evidence yet of a comet impact site on Earth, says Peter Schultz, a planetary geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I.</p>



<p>There are only about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/erosion-has-erased-most-earth-impact-craters-here-are-survivors">190 known impact craters</a> on Earth (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>). Falling space rocks carved out these sites, but none are known to have been created by a comet. That’s because comets, which are made of mostly ice and some rock, tend to explode before reaching the ground, a fate they share with some small asteroids. These fiery events — known as airbursts — are dramatic, generating massive amounts of heat and strong winds. But the effects are temporary and often fail to leave lasting imprints, like craters, behind.</p>





<p>That’s especially true in wet environments. In 1908, an airburst from an asteroid or comet over a remote part of Russia flattened trees and generated a shock wave that knocked people off their feet hundreds of kilometers away. The trees have since grown back over the site of what’s now known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tunguska-century-later">the Tunguska blast</a>, leaving just a marsh (<em>SN: 6/5/08</em>). “If it hadn’t been observed, no one would know it happened,” says Mark Boslough, a physicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who wasn’t involved in the new research.</p>



<p>The Atacama, the world’s driest desert, is better suited to preserving impact sites. And it’s full of sand — the raw material for making glass, which forms when sand is heated to high temperatures. Heat from volcanic activity is responsible for almost all of the naturally derived glass on Earth.</p>



<p>The desert’s glass corridor, however, is kilometers away from the closest volcano, suggesting the glass formed in a different type of heating event, such as an airburst. But radiocarbon dating of ancient plants in the soil around the glass seemed to indicate that the pieces didn’t all form at the same time. Because airbursts rarely occur in the same place twice, the evidence led some researchers to suggest that the glass formed during several massive grass fires.</p>



<p>That idea, Schultz says, “seemed really weird to us because there just wasn’t enough grass for fires,” even long ago when the area probably had more greenery than it does today. After examining some of the glass, he and colleagues determined that it had formed at temperatures exceeding 1700° Celsius — much hotter than grass fires.</p>



<p>What’s more, the team discovered embedded within the glass compounds found in comets sampled during <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/taste-comet-spacecraft-samples-and-views-wild-2">NASA&#8217;s Stardust mission</a> but almost never in asteroids (<em>SN: 1/7/04</em>). The only way for this space dust to have made its way into the glass is if a very old chunk of space debris, such as a comet, exploded at the moment that the glass formed, the researchers say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="300" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/111521_FK_comet-glass_inline-680.png" alt="microscope image of folds in glass" class="wp-image-3105695" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/111521_FK_comet-glass_inline-680.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/111521_FK_comet-glass_inline-680-330x146.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105695">Strong winds from an ancient comet’s explosion folded glass as it formed in what’s now the Atacama Desert, a study finds.

The yellow dot marks where the section was taken.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105695">Scott Harris/Fernbank Science Center</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s pretty clear that this is an impact,” Boslough says. “And in this case, there’s no evidence for a crater, so this event was a pure airburst.”</p>



<p>An airburst would also help explain why the glass appears twisted. “It was clear the glass had been thrown around and rolled. It was basically kneaded like bread,” Schultz says. Grass fires may melt the ground, but they rarely fling it around. Like Tunguska, the airburst probably generated strong winds that flung the glass as it formed, creating the folded look.</p>



<p>The violence of the impact would have scattered glass far across the desert and onto different layers of sediment. Because those layers formed at different times, that may have created the illusion that the glass was created during multiple events. Looking at the dating of plants that came in direct contact with the glass allowed the researchers to pin down the date of the probable comet strike to about 12,000 years ago.</p>



<p>That timing places the event about 800 years after a mysterious period of rapid cooling known as the Younger Dryas, which coincided with the extinction of many large animals. Some scientists have suggested that a comet exploding over the Northern Hemisphere set off a series of events that led to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">frigid conditions</a>, though the idea is controversial (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>).</p>



<p>The timing of the Atacama comet strike shows that it wasn’t related to the Younger Dryas event, Schultz says, but the finding does lay the groundwork for identifying other potential comet sites on Earth.</p>



<p>Even without a link to the Younger Dryas, the Atacama impact would have left a strong impression on anyone who saw it. Archaeological evidence suggests that people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago">lived in the area at the time</a> and thus may have witnessed the airburst (<em>SN: 11/30/15</em>). “It would have seemed like the entire horizon was on fire,” Schultz says. “If you weren’t religious before, you would be after.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/17/ghosting-is-more-acceptable-to-people-with-dark-triad-traits/">Ghosting Is More Acceptable To People With “Dark Triad” Traits</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Even the most shallow dater would have to concede that our personalities play a huge role in our romantic lives. How we start relationships, how we behave when we’re in them, and how they end are all intimately related to our personality traits, good and bad.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000169182100175X?dgcid=rss_sd_all#!">new study</a>, published in <em>Acta Psychologica</em>, looks closely at one way a relationship can end: through ghosting. For those lucky enough to be unfamiliar with the term, ghosting refers to the act of ending a relationship by simply ceasing to respond to the other person, removing them from social media, unmatching them on a dating app, or failing to ever text back. And Peter K. Jonason from the University of Padua and team find that this strategy is considered more acceptable by those high in the Dark Triad traits of psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism.</p>



<span id="more-44592"></span>



<p>The participants, 341 American men and women, were first given a definition of ghosting (“when a person abruptly socially disengages with someone they are romantically/sexually involved with little to no explanation”). They then undertook measures of the Dark Triad traits, agreeing or disagreeing with statements including “It’s not wise to tell your secrets”, “people see me as a natural leader” and “payback needs to be quick and nasty”.</p>



<p>Participants also indicated how much they agreed with statements that ghosting is an acceptable way to end either a short or long-term relationship — and, finally, revealed whether or not they had ghosted somebody in the past.</p>



<p>The team found people who scored higher in the Dark Triad traits tended to see ghosting as more acceptable, at least in the context of short-term relationships. Men with narcissistic traits were also more likely to see ghosting as acceptable than women with those traits, while those who had ghosted in the past had more Machiavellian and more psychopathic traits than those who had not.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, ghosting was seen by all participants as more acceptable in shorter rather than longer-term relationships, and those who had ghosted people in the past rated ghosting as more acceptable than those who had not, with short-term ghosting especially okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team suggests that lower levels of empathy among those with Dark Triad traits could help to explain the results. People who are high in psychopathy and Machiavellianism in particular tend to have lower levels of empathy, so a deficit in their ability to feel the pain caused by ghosting a partner could leave them more likely to ghost them.</p>



<p>It’s important to take the results with a grain of salt, however. No matter how frustrating or hurtful it can be to be ghosted, assigning unpleasant or impolite dating behaviour to psychopathy or narcissism is unlikely to be helpful or even particularly accurate. There are many reasons someone might ghost a romantic partner, not all of them malicious — someone might have a lot going on in their personal life, have miscommunicated how important the relationship was to them, or have been hurt themselves by the person they ghosted.</p>



<p>Seeing such behaviours as a straightforwardly narcissistic thing to do potentially belies the nuances of human relationships. Future research could look more closely at why people find ghosting acceptable and why they themselves had ghosted in practice. These results may provide more insight into why people decide to cut ties.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about a paper &quot;Complementary Codes for Odor Identity and Intensity in Olfactory Cortex&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The ability to represent both stimulus identity and intensity is
fundamental for perception. Using large-scale population recordings in
awake mice, we find distinct coding strategies facilitate non-
interfering representations of odor identity and intensity in piriform
cortex. Simply knowing which neurons were activated is sufficient to
accurately represent odor identity, with no additional information
about identity provided by spike time or spike count. Decoding
analyses indicate that cortical odor representations are not sparse.
Odorant concentration had no systematic effect on spike counts,
indicating that rate cannot encode intensity. Instead, odor intensity
can be encoded by temporal features of the population response. We
found a subpopulation of rapid, largely concentration-invariant
responses was followed by another population of responses whose
latencies systematically decreased at higher concentrations. Cortical
inhibition transforms olfactory bulb output to sharpen these dynamics.
Our data therefore reveal complementary coding strategies that can
selectively represent distinct features of a stimulus.</p>

                <p>It all happens in a snap. New high-speed video exposes the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it physics behind snapping your fingers.</p>



<p>The footage reveals the extreme speed at which the gesture occurs, and shows that friction plus the compressibility of the finger pads are <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0672">key to humans’ ability to snap</a> properly, researchers report November 17 in <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>.</p>



<p>Finger snaps last only about seven milliseconds — that’s roughly 20 times as fast as the blink of an eye, says biophysicist Saad Bhamla of Georgia Tech in Atlanta. After slipping off the thumb, the middle finger rotates at a rate up to 7.8 degrees per millisecond, nearly what a professional baseball pitcher’s arm can achieve, the team found. And a snapping finger accelerates almost three times as fast as pitchers’ arms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch high-speed video of a finger snap | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFy3uJYctZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>This high-speed video shows how a finger snap happens. The middle finger releases pent up energy as it slips off the thumb, hitting the palm at high speed roughly seven milliseconds later.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When covered with high-friction rubber or low-friction lubricant, fingers made snaps that fell flat, the team found, indicating that bare fingers have a level of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-seek-materials-defy-friction-atomic-level">friction</a> ideal for a speedy snap (<em>SN: 8/1/19</em>). That friction between thumb and middle finger allows energy to be stored before it’s suddenly unleashed. Too little friction means less pent-up energy and a slower snap. But too much friction impedes the finger’s release, also slowing the snap.</p>



<p>Bhamla and colleagues were inspired by a scene in the 2018 movie <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>. The supervillain Thanos snaps his fingers while wearing a supernatural metal glove, obliterating half of the universe’s life. The team wondered if it would be possible to snap while wearing a rigid glove. Typically, when the fingers press together in a snap, they compress, increasing the contact area and friction between them. So the researchers tested snapping with fingers covered by hard thimbles. Sure enough, the snaps were sluggish.</p>



<p>So Thanos’ snap would have been a dud. No superheroes needed: Physics saves the day.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Since anaesthetics were first used in 1846 there have been reports of sexual hallucinations during medical procedures. And, though there’s been much discussion about the relationship between anaesthesia and these hallucinations, awareness of this side effect amongst both clinicians and academics remains somewhat low. The consequences of clinicians being accused of sexual misconduct that was in actuality a hallucination can extremely be serious; some have lost their licenses to practice, despite being acquitted.</p>



<p>But even with the high-stakes consequences of sexual hallucinations, there has been relatively little published on the matter, making it difficult to understand the phenomenon as a whole. However, Alex Orchard and Ellie Heidari at Guy’s and St Thoman’s NHS Trust and King College London have synthesised the scattered existing literature on sexual hallucinations while under conscious sedation <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-021-3423-z">in their recent review</a>. The resulting paper not only theorises as to risk factors which may prompt such hallucinations, but also suggests practical ways that may help clinicians avoid and manage their occurrence.</p>



<span id="more-44588"></span>



<p>The team’s search for peer-reviewed papers covered almost five decades of publications, from 1975 to 2020, which contained references to sexual hallucinations, conscious sedation, and dentistry or anaesthetics. In all, 28 papers were included in their review, 20 of which were from the UK, four from the US, two from China, and one from both Norway and Australia.</p>



<p>A selection of sedative drugs were mentioned in the chosen articles — namely, benzodiazepines (13 papers), propofol (12 papers) and nitrous oxide (three papers) — with 15 papers mentioning use of a combination of sedatives. Some of the chosen publications also provided estimates of the prevalence of sexual hallucinations in patients under the influence of each of these drugs. These, however, vary widely. For example, an included paper from 1986 by JW Dundee estimated that a low dosage of midazolam (a benzodiazepine) would produce this side effect in one in between 50,000 and 100,000 patients. At higher doses, this same paper concluded that as many as one in 2000 patients may experience some form of sexual hallucination. Some research into propofol by Zhiyong Yang and Bin Yi in 2016 was much more generous in its estimates, stating that a high dose could produce such hallucinations in as many as 10% of patients.</p>



<p>Twelve of the papers included in this review focused on dental treatment, whereas others centred around endoscopy (six papers), gynaecological and urinary procedures (seven papers), and breast or orthopedic surgery (one each). Though this covers quite a wide array of procedures and specialities, the majority of papers make mention of a “procedure-specific stimulus” which, in combination with sedation, was associated with sexual hallucinations. For example, in the case of dentistry, suction tubes to clear saliva and blood may be misinterpreted by patients in states of altered consciousness.</p>



<p>Patients experiencing such hallucinations may behave in particular ways under sedation, such as making references to past sexual encounters, making advances towards clinicians, or declaring that the clinician is touching them inappropriately. Interestingly, though sexual hallucinations while under anaesthesia have been documented in both men and women, men tend to report more vivid and positive hallucinatory experiences than women. This may be explainable by the fact that women, generally speaking, are very aware of the dangers posed by non-consensual advances, and therefore may be more readily fearful. However, since ages and genders of those included in the literature vary so widely, it’s not yet possible to determine if these factors significantly affect the prevalence of these hallucinations.</p>



<p>The authors bring these insights from previous literature together into a theory of a relationship between sedation, stimuli, and patient risk factors. Though they believe that sedation may be enough to prompt these hallucinations on its own, there is likely an additive effect of procedure-specific stimuli (eg. vaginal swabs, suction tubes) and patient predisposition to hallucinations (eg. mental health conditions, drug use).</p>



<p>In order to protect against the occurrence of sexual hallucinations, the authors recommend adhesion to existing professional guidelines for conscious sedation. These range from conducting pre-assessments of patients for risk factors associated with hallucinations, the presence of a third party to witness procedures, and checking in with patients about their experiences after the procedure concludes. In the event that sexual hallucinations have occurred, however, the authors recommend debriefing the patient in a sensitive manner, ideally in the presence of a third party that witnessed the procedure, and recording the side effect in medical notes to inform future clinicians.</p>



<p>As this side effect is relatively rare (or at least rarely reported), the quality and strength of evidence included in this review understandably leaves something to be desired. A prime example of this is the statement that dosages exceeding 0.1mg/kg of midazolam increases the likelihood of sexual hallucinations; as the team points out, this claim has been regularly made in the literature, but originated from a single author more than 20 years ago, and has seemingly been unchecked since. The majority of peer-reviewed papers on this phenomenon also come from the UK, so future research is needed to look at its prevalence in other cultures.</p>



<p>Even so, given the high — and potentially career ending — costs associated with accusations of sexual hallucinations, this review will be welcomed by many. Not only will it undoubtedly increase awareness of the phenomenon and procedures to ensure continued patient and doctor wellbeing, it may attract some additional research to further validate and understand what causes these hallucinations to occur.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541644182">Life as We Made It</a><br><em>Beth Shapiro</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>With genetic engineering, humans have recently unleashed a surreal fantasia: pigs that excrete less environment-polluting phosphorus, ducklings hatched from chicken eggs, beagles that glow ruby red under ultraviolet light. Biotechnology poses unprecedented power and potential — but also follows a course thousands of years in the making.</p>



<p>In <em>Life as We Made It</em>, evolutionary biologist Beth Shapiro pieces together a palimpsest of human tinkering. From domesticating dogs to hybridizing endangered Florida panthers, people have been bending evolutionary trajectories for millennia. Modern-day technologies capable of swapping, altering and switching genes on and off inspire understandable unease, Shapiro writes. But they also offer opportunities to accelerate adaptation for the better — creating plague-resistant ferrets, for instance, or rendering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">disease-carrying mosquitoes sterile</a> to reduce their numbers (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>).</p>





<p>For anyone curious about the past, present and future of human interference in nature, <em>Life as We Made It</em> offers a compelling survey of the possibilities and pitfalls. Shapiro is an engaging, clear-eyed guide, leading readers through the technical tangles and ethical thickets of this not-so-new frontier. Along the way, the book glitters with lively, humorous vignettes from Shapiro’s career in ancient DNA research. Her tales are often rife with awe (and ripe with the stench of thawing mammoths and other Ice Age matter).</p>





<p>The book’s first half punctures the misconception that we “have only just begun to meddle with nature.” Humans have meddled for 50,000 years: hunting, domesticating and conserving. The second half chronicles the advent of recent biotechnologies and their often bumpy rollouts, leading to squeamishness about genetically modified food and a blunder that resulted in accidentally transgenic cattle.</p>



<p>As we teeter on a technological precipice, Shapiro contends we have a choice to make. We can learn to meddle with greater precision, wielding the sharpest tools at our disposal. Or, she writes, “we can reject our new biotechnologies” and continue directing evolutionary fates anyway, “just more slowly and with less success.” Shapiro speculates about what the future may hold if we embrace our role as tinkerers: plastic-gobbling microbes, saber-toothed house cats, agricultural crops optimized for sequestering carbon. Whether these visions will come true is anyone’s guess. But one thing is clear. No matter which route we choose, humans will continue to stir the evolutionary soup. There’s no backing out now.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rocky-planets-exotic-chemical-elements-mantle-white-dwarf-stars">Distant rocky planets may have exotic chemical makeups that don’t resemble Earth’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>If a real Captain Kirk ever blasts off for other stars in search of rocky planets like ours, he may find lots of strange new worlds whose innards actually bear no resemblance to Earth’s.</p>



<p>A smattering of heavy elements sprinkled on 23 white dwarf stars suggests that most of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26403-8">rocky planets that once orbited the stars had unusual chemical makeups</a>, researchers report online November 2 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The elements, presumably debris from busted-up worlds, provide a possible peek at the planets’ mantles, the region between their crust and core.</p>



<p>“These planets could be just utterly alien to what we’re used to thinking of,” says geologist Keith Putirka of California State University, Fresno. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But deducing what a long-gone planet was made of from what it left behind is fraught with difficulties, cautions Caltech planetary scientist David Stevenson. Rocky worlds outside of the solar system may have exotic chemical compositions, he says. “It’s just that I don’t think this paper can be used to <em>prove</em> that.”</p>





<p>After a star like the sun expands into a red giant star, it ultimately blows off its atmosphere, leaving behind its small, dense core, which becomes a white dwarf. That star’s great gravity drags heavy chemical elements into its interior, so most white dwarfs have pristine surfaces of hydrogen and helium.</p>



<p>But more than a quarter of these stars sport surfaces with heavier elements such as silicon and iron, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-dwarfs-gobble-earthlike-treats">presumably from planets that once circled the star</a> and met their ends when it expanded into a red giant (<em>SN: 8/15/11</em>). The heavy elements on these white dwarfs haven’t yet had time to sink beneath the stellar surface.</p>



<p>For that reason, Siyi Xu, an astronomer at the Gemini Observatory in Hilo, Hawaii, has long studied white dwarfs. Then she met Putirka. Because he’s a geologist, “he was like, ‘Oh! We can look at this problem from a new perspective,’” Xu says.</p>



<p>Xu had been measuring the abundances of chemical elements littered on white dwarfs by studying the wavelengths of light, or spectra, given off by the stars. Putirka realized that those measurements could indicate what rocks and minerals had made up the destroyed planets’ mantles, which constitute the bulk of a small planet’s rock, because different rocks and minerals contain different chemical elements.</p>



<p>By examining white dwarfs within 650 light-years of the sun, Putirka and Xu reached a startling conclusion about the ripped-apart rocky planets. Contrary to conventional wisdom, most of their planetary mantles didn’t resemble those of the sun’s rocky planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, the researchers say.</p>



<p>For example, some of the white dwarfs have lots of silicon. That suggests that their planets’ mantles had quartz — a mineral that in its pure form consists solely of silicon and oxygen. But there’s little, if any, quartz in Earth’s mantle. A planet with a quartz-rich mantle would probably differ greatly from Earth, Putirka says.</p>



<p>Such exotic mineral compositions might affect, for example, volcanic eruptions, continental drift and the fraction of a planet’s surface that consists of oceans versus continents. And all those phenomena might affect the development of life.</p>



<p>Stevenson, however, is skeptical of the new finding. When you measure the elemental composition of a “polluted white dwarf,” he says, “you do not know how to connect those numbers to what you started with.”</p>



<p>That’s partly because the destruction of rocky worlds around sunlike stars is complicated, Stevenson says. The planets first get blasted by the red giant’s bright light. Then they may get engulfed by the star’s expanding atmosphere and may even crash into another planet.</p>



<p>Each of these traumatic events could alter a planet’s elemental makeup, as well as possibly send some elements toward the white dwarf ahead of others. As a result, the planetary remains that end up on the star’s surface at one snapshot in time may not reflect the world’s starting composition.</p>



<p>Xu agrees that astronomers don’t know precisely how the breakup plays out or which elements wind up falling onto the white dwarf. Future theoretical studies could provide insight into the matter, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also notes that astronomers have caught asteroids disintegrating around white dwarfs, which offer a small window into the actual breakup process. And future observations of these white dwarfs, she says, could help reveal any changes in elemental composition over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-last-ice-area-climate-change">Scientists are racing to save the Last Ice Area, an Arctic Noah’s Ark</a></h4>

              
                <p>It started with polar bears.</p>



<p>In 2012, polar bear DNA revealed that the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1216424">iconic species had faced extinction before</a>, likely during a warm period 130,000 years ago, but had rebounded. For researchers, the discovery led to one burning question: Could polar bears make a comeback again?</p>



<p>Studies like this one have emboldened an ambitious plan to create a refuge where Arctic, ice-dependent species, from polar bears down to microbes, could hunker down and wait out climate change. For this, conservationists are pinning their hopes on a region in the Arctic dubbed the Last Ice Area — where ice that persists all summer long will survive the longest in a warming world.</p>



<p>Here, the Arctic will take its last stand. But how long the Last Ice Area will hold on to its summer sea ice remains unclear. A computer simulation released in September predicts that the Last Ice Area could retain its summer sea ice indefinitely if emissions from fossil fuels don’t warm the planet more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, which is the goal set by the 2015 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">Paris Climate Agreement</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). But a recent report by the United Nations found that the climate is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">set to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100</a> under current pledges to reduce emissions, spelling the end of the Arctic’s summer sea ice (<em>SN: 10/26/21</em>).</p>





<p>Nevertheless, some scientists are hoping that humankind will rally to curb emissions and implement technology to capture carbon and other greenhouse gases, which could reduce, or even reverse, the effects of climate change on sea ice. In the meantime, the Last Ice Area could buy ice-dependent species time in the race against extinction, acting as a sanctuary where they can survive climate change, and maybe one day, make their comeback.</p>





<h4>Ecosystem of the frozen sea</h4>



<p>The Last Ice Area is a vast floating landscape of solid ice extending from the northern coast of Greenland to Canada’s Banks Island in the west. This region, roughly the length of the West Coast of the United States, is home to the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic, thanks to an archipelago of islands in Canada’s far north that prevents sea ice from drifting south and melting in the Atlantic.</p>



<p>As sea ice from others part of the Arctic rams into this natural barrier, it piles up, forming long towering ice ridges that run for kilometers across the frozen landscape. From above, the area appears desolate. “It’s a pretty quiet place,” says Robert Newton, an oceanographer at Columbia University and coauthor of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF001988">recent sea ice model</a>, published September 2 in <em>Earth&#8217;s Future</em>. “A lot of the life is on the bottom of the ice.”</p>



<p>The muddy underbelly of icebergs is home to plankton and single-celled algae that evolved to grow directly on ice. These species form the backbone of an ecosystem that feeds everything from tiny crustaceans all the way up to beluga whales, ringed seals and polar bears.</p>



<p>These plankton and algae species can’t survive without ice. So as summer sea ice disappears across the Arctic, the foundation of this ecosystem is literally melting away. “Much of the habitat Arctic species depend on will become uninhabitable,” says Brandon Laforest, an Arctic expert at World Wildlife Fund Canada in Montreal. “There is nowhere else for these species to go. They’re literally being squeezed into the Last Ice Area.”</p>

<p>The last stronghold of summer ice provides an opportunity to create a floating sanctuary —an Arctic ark if you will — for the polar bears and many other species that depend on summer ice to survive. For over a decade, WWF Canada and a coalition of researchers and Indigenous communities have lobbied for the area to be protected from another threat: development by industries that may be interested in the region’s oil and mineral resources.</p>



<p>“The tragedy would be if we had an area where these animals could survive this bottleneck, but they don’t because it’s been developed commercially,” Newton says.</p>



<p>But for Laforest, protecting the Last Ice Area is not only a question of safeguarding arctic creatures. Sea ice is also an important tool in climate regulation, as the white surface reflects sunlight back into space, helping to cool the planet. In a vicious cycle, losing sea ice helps speed up warming, which in turn melts more ice.</p>



<p>And for the people who call the Arctic home, sea ice is crucial for food security, transportation and cultural survival, wrote Inuit Circumpolar Council Chair Okalik Eegeesiak in a 2017 <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/arctic-ocean-and-sea-ice-our-nuna">article for the United Nations</a>. “Our entire cultures and identity are based on free movement on land, sea ice and the Arctic Ocean,” Eegeesiak wrote. “Our highway is sea ice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efforts of these groups have borne some fruit. In 2019, the Canadian government moved to set aside nearly a third of the Last Ice Area as protected spaces called marine preserves. Until 2024, all commercial activity within the boundaries of the preserves is forbidden, with provisions for Indigenous peoples. Conservationists are now asking these marine preserves to be put under permanent protection.</p>



<h4>Rifts in the ice</h4>



<p>However, there are some troubling signs that the sea ice in the region is already precarious. Most worrisome was the appearance in May 2020 of a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL095099">Rhode Island—sized rift in the ice</a> at the heart of the Last Ice Area. Kent Moore, a geophysicist at the University of Toronto, says that these unusual events may become more frequent as the ice thins. This suggests that the Last Ice Area may not be as resilient as we thought, he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something that worries Laforest. He and others are skeptical that reversing climate change and repopulating the Arctic with ice-dependent species will be possible. “I would love to live in a world where we eventually reverse warming and promote sea ice regeneration,” he says. “But stabilization seems like a daunting task on its own.”</p>



<p>Still, hope remains. “All the models show that if you were to bring temperatures back down, sea ice will revert to its historical pattern within several years,” says Newton.</p>



<p>To save the last sea ice — and the creatures that depend on it — removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will be essential, says oceanographer Stephanie Pfirman of Arizona State University in Tempe, who coauthored the study on sea ice with Newton. Technology to capture carbon, and prevent more carbon from entering the atmosphere, already exists. The largest carbon capture plant is in Iceland, but projects like that one have yet to be implemented on a major scale.</p>



<p>Without such intervention, the Arctic is set to lose the last of its summer ice before the end of the century. It would mean the end of life on the ice. But Pfirman, who suggested making the Last Ice Area a World Heritage Site in 2008, says that humankind has undergone big economic and social changes — like the kind needed to reduce emissions and prevent warming — in the past. “I was in Germany when the [Berlin] wall came down, and people hadn’t expected <em>that </em>to happen,” she says.</p>



<p>Protecting the Last Ice Area is about buying time to protect sea ice and species, says Pfirman. The longer we can hold on to summer sea ice, she says, the better chance we have at bringing arctic species —from plankton to polar bears — back from the brink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-analogies-can-make-complex-science-clear">How analogies can make complex science clear</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many writers and editors at <em>Science News</em> have advanced degrees in the sciences. I am not one of them. So when I read an article on a subject like epigenetics or quantum physics, I expect that I’ve got my work cut out for me.</p>



<p>Fortunately, our journalists are adept at explaining complex concepts in ways that are clear and engaging without dumbing them down. This issue’s cover story, “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-isotope-elements-new-particle-accelerator-atom-nucleus">In search of extreme nuclei</a>,” is a prime example. It’s about physicists building a new particle accelerator in a quest to find rare isotopes of elements — a fascinating tale but one that I’m guessing many of us are hearing for the first time.</p>



<p>As I read the story, I was struck by how physics writer Emily Conover, one of our senior writers, used metaphors to guide me through this alien territory. I never felt lost, and the journey was a delight. For instance, when describing the neutron drip line, a boundary beyond which an atom’s nucleus has more neutrons than it can contain, Conover writes: “Imagine a greedy chipmunk with its cheeks so full of nuts that when it tries to shove in one more, another nut pops right back out.”</p>



<p>I asked Conover how she came up with this delightful analogy, and she said it just popped into her head. “I had recently watched a YouTube video of a chipmunk greedily stuffing nuts into its mouth,” she said. “But then there are other times when you have to sit down and think of something to compare, because you have such a complex topic you really need an analogy for people to grasp what you’re talking about.”</p>





<p>Sometimes the scientists help out. The simile comparing the difficulty of accelerating ions to herding cats came from Thomas Glasmacher, the laboratory director for the new particle accelerator, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. “They also have to explain their very complicated research to the public,” Conover said. “I’ll take their tricks when they give them to me.” Conover had fun with the concept, carrying the notion even further by adding that “rather than cat food, electromagnetic forces get [the ions] moving en masse.”</p>



<p>Conover is trained as a particle physicist, and she takes care to remember that most of our readers don’t share her level of expertise. “I try to step back all the time when I’m writing to keep in mind the perspective of someone who doesn’t know anything about this topic. I have to be like, ‘Oh yeah, a normal person does not know this.’ ”</p>



<p>And she makes sure any analogy she uses passes muster with the scientists too. “It can’t be something that a physicist would read and say, ‘No, it’s not like that.’ You’re making it clear for the reader while also making it correct.”</p>



<p>I’ll end with a vexing logistical update. Global supply chain disruptions have made it difficult for us to get the usual paper stock for <em>Science News</em>. Thus the pages in this issue are a bit glossier than usual. Paper shortages and postal delays may also hold up the magazine’s arrival. We’re doing our best to get it to you ASAP.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-isotope-elements-new-particle-accelerator-atom-nucleus">A new particle accelerator aims to unlock secrets of bizarre atomic nuclei</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inscribed on an Italian family’s 15th century coat of arms and decorating an ancient Japanese shrine, the Borromean rings are symbolically potent. Remove one ring from the trio of linked circles and the other two fall apart. It’s only when all three are entwined that the structure holds. The rings have represented the concepts of unity, the Christian Holy Trinity and even certain exotic atomic nuclei.</p>



<p>A rare variety, or isotope, of lithium has a nucleus that is made of three conjoined parts. Lithium-11’s nucleus is separated into a main cluster of protons and neutrons flanked by two neutrons, which form a halo around the core. Remove any one piece and the trio disbands, much like the Borromean rings.</p>



<p>Not only that, lithium-11’s nucleus is enormous. With its wide halo, it is the same size as a lead nucleus, despite having nearly 200 fewer protons and neutrons. The discovery of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physics-77">lithium-11’s expansive halo</a> in the mid-1980s shocked scientists (<em>SN: 8/20/88, p. 124</em>), as did its Borromean nature. “There wasn’t a prediction of this,” says nuclear theorist Filomena Nunes of Michigan State University in East Lansing. “This was one of those discoveries that was like, ‘What? What’s going on?’ ”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="450" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-450x450.png" alt="Borromean rings" class="wp-image-3105570" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-450x450.png 450w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-383x383.png 383w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-186x186.png 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-580x580.png 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680-214x214.png 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-1_680.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105570">Remove one of the three Borromean rings and the whole structure falls apart. Some atomic nuclei have the same property.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105570">T. Tibbitts</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Lithium-11 is just one example of what happens when nuclei get weird. Such nuclei, Nunes says, “have properties that are mind-blowing.” They can become <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atoms-core-gets-pear-shaped">distorted into unusual shapes</a>, such as a pear (<em>SN: 6/15/13, p. 14</em>). Or they can be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-thick-neutron-skin-atom-nucleus-new-measure-physics">sheathed in a skin of neutrons</a> — like a peel on an inedible nuclear fruit (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 5</em>).</p>



<p>A new tool will soon help scientists pluck these peculiar fruits from the atomic vine. Researchers are queuing up to use a particle accelerator at Michigan State to study some of the rarest atomic nuclei. When it opens in early 2022, the <a href="https://frib.msu.edu/">Facility for Rare Isotope Beams</a>, or FRIB (pronounced “eff-rib”), will strip electrons off of atoms to make ions, rev them up to high speeds and then send them crashing into a target to make the special nuclei that scientists want to study.</p>





<p>Experiments at FRIB will probe the limits of nuclei, examining how many neutrons can be crammed into a given nucleus, and studying what happens when nuclei stray far from the stable configurations found in everyday matter. With FRIB data, scientists aim to piece together a theory that explains the properties of all nuclei, even the oddballs. Another central target: pinning down the origin story for chemical elements birthed in the extreme environments of space.</p>



<p>And if scientists are lucky, new mind-blowing nuclear enigmas, perhaps even weirder than lithium-11, will emerge. “We’re going to have a new look into an unexplored territory,” says nuclear physicist Brad Sherrill, scientific director of FRIB. “We think we know what we’ll find, but it’s unlikely that things are going to be as we expect.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>Curious halo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Lithium-11’s nucleus has a center packed with protons and neutrons, surrounded by two neutrons in a broad halo. If one of those three components is removed, the nucleus can’t stay bound, what’s known as a Borromean nucleus.</p>

<h4>Exploring instability</h4>



<p>Atomic nuclei come in a dizzying number of varieties. Scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periodic-table-elements-chemistry-fun-facts-history">discovered 118 chemical elements</a>, distinguished by the number of protons in their nuclei (<em>SN: 1/19/19, p. 18</em>). Each of those elements has a variety of isotopes, different versions of the element formed by switching up the number of neutrons inside the nucleus. Scientists have predicted the existence of about 8,000 isotopes of known elements, but only about 3,300 have made an appearance in detectors. Researchers expect FRIB will make a sizable dent in the missing isotopes. It may identify 80 percent of possible isotopes for all the elements up through uranium, including many never seen before.</p>



<p>The most familiar nuclei are those of the roughly 250 isotopes that are stable: They don’t decay to other types of atoms. The ranks of stable isotopes include the nitrogen-14 and oxygen-16 in the air we breathe and the carbon-12 found in all known living things. The number following the element’s name indicates the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</p>



<p>Stable nuclei have just the right combination of protons and neutrons. Too many or too few neutrons <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periodic-table-life-spans-unstable-radioactive-elements">causes a nucleus to decay</a>, sometimes slowly over billions of years, other times in mere fractions of a second (<em>SN: 3/2/19, p. 32</em>). To understand what goes on inside these unstable nuclei, scientists study them before they decay. In general, as the proton-neutron balance gets more and more off-kilter, a nucleus gets further from stability, and its properties tend to get stranger.</p>



<p>Such exotic specimens test the limits of scientists’ theories of the atomic nucleus. While a given theory might correctly explain nuclei that are near stability, it may fail for more unusual nuclei. But physicists want a theory that can explain the most unusual to the most banal.</p>



<p>“We would like to understand how the atomic nucleus is built, how it works,” says theoretical nuclear physicist Witold Nazarewicz, FRIB’s chief scientist.</p>





<h4>A fast clip</h4>



<p>Accelerating beams of ions in FRIB is like herding cats.</p>



<p>In the beginning, “it’s just a gaggle of cats,” says Thomas Glasmacher, FRIB’s laboratory director. The cats meander this way or that, but if you can nudge the unruly bunch in a particular direction — maybe you open a can of cat food — then the cats start moving together, despite their natural tendency to wander. “Pretty soon, it’s a stream of cats,” he says.</p>



<p>In FRIB’s case, the cats are ions — atoms with some or all of their electrons stripped off. And rather than cat food, electromagnetic forces get them moving en masse.</p>



<p>The journey starts in one of FRIB’s two ion sources, where elements are vaporized and ionized. After some initial acceleration to get the ions moving, the beam enters the linear accelerator, which is what sets the particles really cruising. The linear accelerator looks like a scaled-down freight train — a line of 46 boxes the color of pistachio ice cream, each about 2.5 meters tall, of varying lengths. But the accelerator sends the beam moving much faster than a cargo-filled train — up to about half the speed of light.</p>



<p>Within the green boxes, called cryomodules, superconducting cavities are cooled to just a few kelvins, a smidge above absolute zero. At those temperatures, the cavities can accelerate the ions using rapidly oscillating electromagnetic fields. The chain of pistachio modules wends around the facility in the shape of a paper clip, a contortion necessary so that the approximately 450-meter-long accelerator fits in the 150-meter-long tunnel that houses it.</p>



<p>When the beam is fully accelerated, it’s slammed into a graphite target. That hard hit knocks protons and neutrons off the nuclei of the incoming ions, forming new, rarer isotopes. Then, the specific one that a scientist wants to study is separated from the riffraff by magnets that redirect particles based on their mass and electric charge. The particles of interest are then sent to the experimental area, where scientists can use various detectors to study how the particles decay, measure their properties or determine what reactions they undergo.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Up to speed&nbsp;</h3>



<p>FRIB’s accelerator is bent into a paper clip shape to fit the full 450-meter length of the apparatus in the tunnel where it is housed. Forty-six cryomodules (green boxes) contain superconducting cavities that accelerate particles. Once the ions are accelerated, they are slammed into a target to create new isotopes. Farther down the line, magnets separate out the specific isotopes that scientists want to study.</p>

Tibbitts</span><span class="credit desktop-caption wp-credit-3105584">T. Tibbitts</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The energy of FRIB’s beam is carefully selected for producing rare isotopes. Too much energy would blow the nuclei apart when they collide with the target. So FRIB is designed to reach less than a hundredth the energy of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, the world’s most energetic accelerator.</p>



<p>Instead, the new accelerator’s potential rests on its juiced-up intensity: Essentially, it has lots and lots of particles in its beam. For example, FRIB will be able to slam 50 trillion uranium ions per second into its target. As a result, it will produce more intense streams of rare isotopes than its predecessors could.</p>



<p>For isotopes that are relatively easily produced, FRIB will churn out about a trillion per second; plenty to study. That opens prospects for scrutinizing isotopes that are more difficult to make. Those isotopes might pop up once a week in FRIB, but that’s still much more often than in a weaker beam. It’s like a case of low water pressure in the bathroom: “You can’t have a shower if it’s just trickling,” says Nunes, who is one of the leaders of a coalition of theoretical physicists supporting research at FRIB. Now, “FRIB is going to come in with a fire hose.”</p>

<h4>Dripping with neutrons</h4>



<p>That fire hose will also come in handy for pinpointing a crucial boundary known as the neutron drip line.</p>



<p>Try to stuff too many neutrons in a nucleus, and it will decay almost immediately by spitting out a neutron. Imagine a greedy chipmunk with its cheeks so full of nuts that when it tries to shove in one more, another nut pops right back out. The threshold at which nuclei decay in this way marks the ultimate limits for bound nuclei. On a chart of the known elements and their isotopes, this boundary traces out a line, the neutron drip line. So far, scientists know the location of this crucial demarcation up through, at most, the 10th element on the periodic table, neon.</p>



<p>“FRIB is going to be the only way to go heavier and far enough out to define that drip line,” says nuclear physicist Heather Crawford of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. FRIB is expected to determine the neutron drip line up to the 30th element, zinc, and maybe even farther.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Nuclear limits</h3>



<p>Scientists have discovered a slew of isotopes of chemical elements (green). FRIB is expected to find new ones (turquoise) within the full range of predicted isotopes (gold). The neutron drip line, the bottom edge of the colored region, marks the limits of nuclei, but scientists don’t know exactly where it lies.</p>

<p>Near that drip line, where neutrons greatly outnumber protons, is where nuclei get especially strange. Lithium-11, with its capacious halo, sits right next to the drip line. Crawford focuses on magnesium isotopes that are close to the drip line. The most common stable magnesium isotope has 12 protons and 12 neutrons. Crawford’s main target, magnesium-40, has 12 protons and more than double that number of neutrons — 28 — in its nucleus.</p>



<p>“That’s right out at the limits of existence,” Crawford says. Out there, theories that predict the properties of nuclei are no longer reliable. Theoretical physicists can’t always be sure what size and shape a given nucleus in this realm might be, or even whether it qualifies as a bound nucleus. A given theory might also fall short when predicting how much energy is needed to bump the nucleus into its various energized states. The spacing of these energy levels acts as a kind of fingerprint of an atomic nucleus, one that’s highly sensitive to the details of the nucleus’ shape and other properties.</p>



<p>Sure enough, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.052501">magnesium-40 behaves unexpectedly</a>, Crawford and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. While theories predicted its energy levels would match those of magnesium isotopes with slightly fewer neutrons, magnesium-40’s energy levels were significantly lower than its neighbors’.</p>



<p>In August, Crawford learned that she will be one of the first scientists to use FRIB. Two experiments she and colleagues proposed were selected for the first round of about 30 experiments to take place over FRIB’s first two years. She’ll take a closer look at magnesium-40, which, like lithium-11, has a Borromean nucleus. Crawford now aims to determine if her chosen isotope also has a haloed nucleus. That’s one possible explanation for magnesium-40’s oddness. Despite the fact that nuclei with halos have been known for decades, theories still can’t reliably predict which nuclei will be festooned with them. Understanding magnesium-40 could help scientists firm up their accounting of nuclei’s neutron adornments.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Nucleus possibilities&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Unstable magnesium-40 has a nucleus packed with many more neutrons (blue) than the more common, stable magnesium-24, although both have the same number of protons (red). Scientists want to know if magnesium-40 has a typical nucleus or one with a large neutron halo.</p>

<h4>Elemental origins</h4>



<p>Physicists want to be able to poke around, like mechanics under the hood, to understand the cosmic nuclear reactions that make the universe go. “Nuclear physics is like the engine of a sports car. It’s what happens in the engine that determines how well the car performs,” says nuclear physicist Ani Aprahamian of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.</p>



<p>The cosmos powered by that engine can be a violent place for nuclei, punctuated with dramatic stellar explosions and extreme conditions, including matter crammed into ultratight quarters by crushing gravity. These environments beget wonders of nuclear physics unlike those normally seen on Earth. FRIB will let scientists get a glimpse at some of those processes.</p>



<p>For example, physicists think that certain neutron-rich environments are the cauldron where many of the universe’s chemical elements are cooked. This cosmic connection allowed nuclear physicist Jolie Cizewski to make good on a childhood dream.</p>



<p>When Cizewski was a little girl, she caught the astronomy bug, she says. “I decided I was going to become an astronomer so I could go into space.” It might seem that she took a left turn from her childhood obsession. She never made it to orbit and she didn’t become an astronomer.</p>



<p>But echoes of that childhood dream now anchor her research. Instead of peering at the stars with a telescope, she’ll soon be using FRIB to reveal secrets of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Cizewski, of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., is working to unveil details of the cosmic nuclear reactions responsible for the nuclei that surround us. “I’m trying to understand how the elements, in particular those heavier than iron, have been synthesized,” she says.</p>



<p>Many of the elements around us — and in us — formed within stars. As large stars age, they fuse progressively larger atomic nuclei together in their cores, creating elements farther along the periodic table — oxygen, carbon, neon and others. But the process halts at iron. The rest of the elements must be born another way.</p>



<p>A process called the rapid neutron capture process, or r-process, is responsible for many of those other elements found in nature. In the r-process, atomic nuclei quickly soak up neutrons and bulk up to large masses. The neutronfest is interspersed with radioactive decays that form new elements. The sighting of two neutron stars merging in 2017 revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">such collisions are one place where the r-process occurs</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/17, p. 6</em>). But scientists suspect it might happen in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dying-stars-called-collapsars-may-forge-much-universe-gold">other cosmic locales</a> as well (<em>SN: 6/8/19, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Cizewski and colleagues are studying an abbreviated form of the r-process that might thrive in supernovas, which may not have enough oomph for the full r-process. The team has zeroed in on germanium-80, which plays a pivotal role in the weak r-process. Physicists want to know how likely this nucleus is to capture another neutron to become germanium-81. At FRIB, Cizewski will slam a beam of germanium-80 into deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. Knowing how often germanium-80 captures the neutron will help scientists nail down the neutron-slurping chain of the weak r-process, wherever it might crop up.</p>

<h4>A Borromean bent</h4>



<p>Like the interlinked Borromean rings, different facets of nuclear physics are closely entwined, from mysteries of the cosmos to the inner workings of nuclei. The exotic nuclei that FRIB cooks up could also allow physicists to tap into the very bedrock of physics by testing certain fundamental laws of nature. And there’s a practical side to the facility as well. Scientists could collect some of the isotopes FRIB produces for use in medical procedures, for example.</p>



<p>Physicists are ready for surprises. “Every time we build such a facility, new discoveries come and breakthroughs in science come,” Nazarewicz says. Like the 1980s discovery of lithium-11’s Borromean nucleus, scientists may find something totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Along with studying atomic nuclei at extremes and exploring nuclear physics of the stars, scientists hope to use FRIB to make progress in two other key areas.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="80" height="80" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112021_isotopes_inline-10-tb.png" alt="Terbium icon showing abbreviation and atomic number" class="wp-image-3105560" /></figure></div>



<h5>Harvesting useful nuclei</h5>



<p>Scientists plan to collect isotopes produced in FRIB for societal applications. In medicine, for example, certain isotopes, such as terbium-149, can be used for radiation treatment or medical imaging.</p>



<p>When this isotope of the rare earth metal terbium decays, it can emit alpha particles (helium nuclei) that can kill cancer cells. Its half-life of 4.1 hours is in a sweet spot: fast enough to have an effect — it doesn’t take hundreds of years to decay — but not so fast that it’s gone within seconds, before it can do its work.</p>

<h5>Testing laws of nature</h5>



<p>Scientists plan to check certain physics rules, for example, the idea that matter and antimatter behave as mirror images. Certain hypothetical physics effects could cause particles to flout this rule, and that could help explain why there’s more matter than antimatter in the universe.</p>



<p>Effects that could make matter and antimatter behave differently might also cause electric charge in atoms to separate, with slightly more positive charge on one side of the atom and more negative on the other. In most atoms, this separation may be too tiny to measure. But in radium-225, which has a pear-shaped nucleus, the effect would be stronger, as the nucleus’ asymmetry should enhance the asymmetry of the atom’s charge. </p>

<h4>Surf’s up</h4>



<p><em>A laser experiment suggests that protons in outer space can accelerate by surfing shock waves within plasma, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-surfing-shock-wave-physics-particle-laser">Shock waves give protons a boost</a>” (</em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 7<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Norma Frank</strong> wanted to know why the protons surf shock waves at all.</p>



<p>Protons in the presence of such cosmic shock waves don’t have much choice, <strong>Conover </strong>says. “The electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of the shock wave create forces that push and pull the protons, according to the laws of physics,” she says. “That’s what causes the particles to surf.”</p>





<h4>Mind the map</h4>



<p><em>Humans tend to arrange abstract ideas such as numbers or time spatially, but we don’t all use the same directions, <strong>Sujata Gupta</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-number-line-space-map-different-directions">Culture shapes humans’ mental maps</a>” (</em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>John Strand </strong>asked whether native languages influence the direction in which people map objects.</p>



<p>Written language may influence directionality, <strong>Gupta</strong> says. A study published in 2005 in the <em>Journal of Cognition and Culture</em> examined how Arabic speakers, who read from right to left, arrange numbers in a line. That study revealed that people who read only in Arabic <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/5/1-2/article-p165_7.xml">tend to place lower magnitude items on the right</a> — the opposite of native English speakers. This tendency was weaker for people who could read in both Arabic and English, and was not observed in Arabic speakers who couldn’t read, the researchers found.</p>



<h4>Reckoning with racism in science</h4>



<p><em>Some everyday names for animals and plants contain racist or offensive connotations. A movement to change those monikers is growing within the scientific community,<strong> Jaime Chambers</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">Racist legacies lurk in common names</a>” (</em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>“Bravo to this initiative!” wrote reader <strong>Fatimah L.C. Jackson</strong>, a biologist at Howard University in Washington, D.C. “This is an important step to making the world a better place.”</p>



<h4>Bidding brows adieu</h4>



<p><em>The last century of paleoanthropology has sketched out a rough timeline of how human evolution played out, centering its early roots in Africa, <strong>Erin Wayman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">Tracing the origins of humans</a>” (</em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 20<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Elizabeth Hatcher</strong> wondered when and why humans lost the prominent brow ridges sported by many early human ancestors.</p>



<p>“No one knows for sure why humans lost big, heavy brow ridges,” <strong>Wayman</strong> says. One recent idea is that the loss was a consequence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-facial-development-hints-humans-domesticated-themselves">human “self-domestication”</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/20, p. 16</em>). Sometime over the last few hundred thousand years, the theory goes, humans became more cooperative and peaceful, favoring the friendly over the aggressive. Selecting for “tameness” among each other also resulted in genetic changes that affected our appearance, leading to small, flatter faces — akin to how selecting for tame wolves as our companions tens of thousands of years ago led to the floppy-eared, curly-tailed dogs we know today.</p>



<p>An offshoot of this idea suggests that smaller brow ridges allowed for the development of mobile eyebrows that could express a range of emotions, <strong>Wayman</strong> says. Being able to communicate even subtle feelings and intentions may have been advantageous at a time when human social relationships were becoming increasingly complex. “Of course, like many things in human evolution, these ideas are controversial,” she says.</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Rick Doughty</strong> praised how <strong>Wayman’s</strong> story put into perspective the last century of efforts to understand human origins. “I remember reading in <em>Science News</em> about the ‘latest news and findings’ that were coming to light in the 1960s and 1970s,” <strong>Doughty</strong> wrote. “I now have a better understanding of the field and also an appreciation for how far we have come in 100 years (and also how much still remains unresolved).”</p>

<h4>Birds of poetry</h4>



<p>Unusually bright plumage (shown below) on some female white-necked jacobin hummingbirds may help them avoid harassment, <strong>Carolyn Wilke</strong> reported in “Female hummingbirds go undercover” (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 11</em>). While the story doesn’t evoke romance, it reminded Twitter user <strong>@vekerim </strong>of Raymond Carver’s poem “Hummingbird,” which he wrote for his wife, Tess Gallagher, a fellow poet: </p>



<p>Suppose I say <em>summer</em>, / write the word “hummingbird,” / put it in an envelope, / take it down the hill / to the box. When you open / my letter you will recall / those days and how much, / just how much, I love you.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/15/we-enjoy-deep-conversations-with-strangers-much-more-than-we-expect-to/">We Enjoy Deep Conversations With Strangers Much More Than We Expect To</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Sometimes the most meaningful conversations come at surprising times: with someone you meet on a train and never see again, with a friend of a friend who you’ve only just met. Conversely, conversations with our closest friends and family can often be difficult, and we sometimes fail to share our deepest thoughts and feelings with those we love the most.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-88608-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,</em> finds that we seriously benefit from these deep conversations with strangers. But, despite this, we sometimes remain reluctant to engage in them, overestimating their awkwardness and underplaying their advantages even when we enjoy them more.</p>



<span id="more-44576"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants read that they would be randomly paired with another person, who they would discuss several questions with. Topics included things in life they felt grateful about and times they had cried in front of another person. They then estimated how much they would be interested in the other person and how interested the other would be in them, how awkward they would feel during the conversation, and how strong a bond they would feel towards them. After having the conversation, they rated their actual experience of the conversation using these same metrics.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants had underestimated how interested they would be in the other person — and how interested that person was in them. They also underestimated how connected they would feel with their partner, and <em>over</em>estimated how awkward the conversation would be.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first — only this time, half of the pairs of participants had shallow conversations about TV, lifestyles, and haircuts while half responded to the meaningful questions. Again, participants overestimated how awkward the conversation would be and underestimated how connected they would feel. Those who answered deep questions overestimated the awkwardness significantly more than those who had shallow conversations — and ultimately felt more connected than pairings in the shallow condition. A follow-up study, in which participants picked their own deep questions to discuss, replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In a fourth study, participants reported how much they thought they would care about their partner and vice versa before speaking to them on either shallow or deep topics. Participants expected to care more about their own responses than their partner would, particularly in the deep condition, though this wasn’t the case: across both conditions, conversational partners cared more about answers to both shallow and deep questions than was anticipated.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants engaged in both shallow and deep conversations, reporting their expectations and responses as in previous studies. And despite expecting to prefer the shallow conversation to the deep one, participants actually preferred the deep one, again significantly underestimating how much they would enjoy it. Participants were also better at anticipating how conversations with loved ones would go versus strangers, suggesting we &#8220;miscalibrate&#8221; how much people we don’t know are interested in our lives.</p>



<p><a></a>Over the course of seven studies, the results demonstrated that people enjoy deep conversations despite not expecting to. Deep conversations made participants feel more connected to their conversational partners, and were significantly less awkward than anticipated.</p>



<p>This could prevent us from having conversations with all kinds of benefits — because we expect deep conversations with strangers to be painful, and because we expect strangers not to care, we may be avoiding them altogether. But in fact, this study suggests that we care deeply about one another. Remembering this fact, particularly after a year and a half where many of us have been physically alienated from one another, could ultimately lead to better, or at least unexpected, conversations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-shrinking-birds-tropical">Climate change may be shrinking tropical birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a remote corner of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, researchers have spent decades catching and measuring birds in a large swath of forest unmarred by roads or deforestation. An exemplar of the Amazon’s dazzling diversity, the experimental plot was to act as a baseline that would reveal how habitat fragmentation, from logging or roads, can hollow out rainforests’ wild menagerie.</p>



<p>But in this pristine pocket of wilderness, a more subtle shift is happening: The birds are shrinking.</p>



<p>Over 40 years, dozens of Amazonian bird species have declined in mass. Many species have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk1743?_ga=2.158979514.1693468232.1636375617-964207880.1635952783">lost nearly 2 percent of their average body weight</a> each decade, researchers report November 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. What’s more, some species have grown longer wings. The changes coincide with a hotter, more variable climate, which could put a premium on leaner, more efficient bodies that help birds stay cool, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“Climate change isn’t something of the future. It’s happening now and has been happening and has effects we haven’t thought of,” says Ben Winger, an ornithologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the research but has documented similar shrinkage in migratory birds. Seeing the same patterns in so many bird species across widely different contexts “speaks to a more universal phenomenon,” he says.</p>





<p>Biologists have long linked body size and temperature. In colder climates, it pays to be big because having a smaller surface area relative to one’s volume reduces heat loss through the skin and keeps the body warmer. As the climate warms, “you’d expect shrinking body sizes to help organisms off-load heat better,” says Vitek Jirinec, an ecologist at the Integral Ecology Research Center in Blue Lake, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many species of North American migratory birds <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13434">are getting smaller</a>, Winger and colleagues reported in 2020 in <em>Ecology Letters</em>. Climate change is the likely culprit, Winger says, but since migrators experience a wide range of conditions while globe-trotting, other factors such as degraded habitats that birds may encounter can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>To see if birds that stay put have also been shrinking, Jirinec and colleagues analyzed data on nonmigratory birds collected from 1979 to 2019 in an intact region of the Amazon that spans 43 kilometers. The dataset includes measurements such as mass and wing length for over 11,000 individual birds of 77 species. The researchers also examined climate data for the region.</p>

<p>All species declined in mass over this period, the researchers found, including birds as different as the Rufous-capped antthrush (<em>Formicarius colma</em>), which snatches insects off the forest floor, and the Amazonian motmot (<em>Momotus momota</em>)<em>, </em>which scarfs down fruit up in trees. Species lost from about 0.1 percent to nearly 2 percent of their average body weight each decade. The motmot, for example, shrunk from 133 grams to about 127 grams over the study period.</p>



<p>These changes coincided with an overall increase in the average temperature of 1 degree Celsius in the wet season and 1.65 degrees C in the dry season. Temperature and precipitation also became more variable over the time period, and these short-term fluctuations, such as an especially hot or dry season, better explained the size trends than the steady increase in temperature.</p>



<p>“The dry season is really stressful for birds,” Jirinec says. Birds’ mass decreased the most in the year or two after especially hot and dry spells, which tracks with the idea that birds are getting smaller to deal with heat stress.</p>



<p>Other factors, like decreased food availability, could also lead to smaller sizes. But since birds with widely different diets all declined in mass, a more pervasive force like climate change is the likely cause, Jirinec says.</p>



<p>Wing length also grew for 61 species, with a maximum increase of about 1 percent per decade. Jirinec thinks that longer wings make for more efficient, and thus cooler, fliers. For instance, a fighter jet, with its heavy body and compact wings, takes enormous power to maneuver. A light and long-winged glider, by contrast, can cruise along much more efficiently.</p>



<p>“Longer wings may be helping [birds] fly more efficiently and produce less metabolic heat,” which can be beneficial in hotter conditions, he says. “But that’s just a hypothesis.” This body change was most pronounced in birds that spend their time higher up in the canopy, where conditions are hotter and drier than the forest floor.</p>



<p>Whether these changes in shape and size represent an evolutionary adaptation to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">climate change</a>, or simply a physiological response to warmer temperatures, remains unclear (<em>SN: 5/8/20</em>). Whichever is the case, Jirinec suggests that the change shows the pernicious power of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">human activity</a> (<em>SN: 10/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>“The Amazon rainforest is mysterious, remote and teeming with biodiversity,” he says. “This study suggests that even in places like this, far removed from civilization, you can see signatures of climate change.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Hallucinatory experiences are pretty common, despite widespread beliefs to the contrary. Researchers estimate that around 40% of the population regularly experience hallucinations to some degree, whether that be feeling your phone vibrate only to find no notifications, or a full-on out of body experience.</p>



<p>Though hallucinations are common, some are harder to study than others. One of the trickiest has been autoscopic hallucinations, during which people experience a doppelganger of all or part of their body in the space around them.</p>



<p>Though this hallucination has been reported to clinicians, its rarity has made it difficult to observe in an experimental setting — so researchers have instead attempted to induce the phenomenon in the lab. Now, Marte Roel Lesur and team at the University of Zurich have developed a way to experimentally induce it in people who have no history of hallucinations using only auditory cues.</p>



<span id="more-44546"></span>



<p>Previous research has placed significant emphasis on the role of vision in producing these hallucinations, and some visual methods have even been developed to induce these kinds of experiences experimentally. For example, in 2007 researchers at University College London were able to shift participants’ perceptions of where their bodies were in space using a virtual reality video feed of their backs, positioned a few metres behind where they were sitting. But people sometimes also report auditory hallucinations during this phenomenon, leading the team in Zurich to develop a new method that relies on audio cues alone.</p>



<p>In this study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810021001495">published in <em>Consciousness</em></a><em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810021001495"> and Cognition</a></em>,  participants (N=25) produced a series of tightly controlled binaural recordings of themselves walking into a room and reading excerpts from The Little Prince. One set of microphones were placed in the ears of a dummy sitting across the room from the participants, in order to create recordings with true-to-life location cues. Another set of microphones recorded from the ears of the participants themselves.</p>



<p>Participants then sat with their head in the same location and position as the dummy head used for the recordings. While watching a virtual empty room through a VR headset, the participants were played three binaural audio recordings as separate conditions: the recording that had been taken from their own ears, in which they heard themselves from their own location (the self-egocentric condition); the recording that had been taken from the dummy, in which they heard themselves from across the room (the self-allocentric condition); and a recording that had been taken of a gender-matched person speaking from across the room (the other-allocentric condition). After each of these conditions, they answered a 14-point questionnaire measuring how closely participants felt that there was another presence in the room, and how closely they identified it as themselves.</p>



<p>In the second block, participants were played audio of either themselves or matched others navigating around the room, reading from an experimental script — “One, two, three, four, five, point at my feet.” Participants were then asked to point a virtual laser pointer to the floor of the location they heard the audio originating from, in order to give a measure of perceived distance from the speaker. After all the trials were done, they answered two questions to assess if they’d had any previous hallucinatory experiences.</p>



<p>Data collected from the 14-item questionnaire indicated that participants strongly felt a presence walking around them while the self-allocentric audio played (they didn’t report a very strong sense of a doppelganger during the self-egocentric audio). Participants also self-identified with that presence, feeling a sense of body ownership and agency when it was linked to their own voice, as opposed to that of the gender-matched others.</p>



<p>These results suggest that some aspects of bodily self-consciousness can be affected by audio in those with no history of psychiatric or neurological issues. These participants experience what the authors describe as an &#8220;auditory doppelganger&#8221;, with whom they strongly self-identify. One participant even went so far as to report that they felt “as if I was going around myself.” This effect may offer a new avenue through which to investigate bodily self-consciousness in experimental settings.</p>



<p>Perhaps most interesting, however, is that when asked to point to the locations voices originated from, those with no history of hallucinations perceived their own voice in the allocentric condition as originating closer to them than the voice of another person. Conversely, those with a history of hallucinations tended to locate their own allocentric voices as further away from themselves than the voices of others.</p>



<p>Though the authors of this paper emphasise that their findings are preliminary, and based on a very small sample in the hallucinator group (N=4), they offer some speculation as to why this difference may exist, citing previous research on patients with psychosis showing reduced capacity to recognise their own voice. However, even if those in the hallucinator group experienced difficulties in distinguishing their own voice, it’s unclear why they would estimate their voice to be <em>further away</em> than the voice of another person. As this finding was contrary to the team’s original expectations, this issue is likely to be more fully explored by future research.</p>



<p>The study was quite small, which may raise questions as to validity and generalisability of these results. Similarly, sorting of participants into those with and without a history of hallucinations was done using two questions, which is perhaps lacking in the detail required to conduct this kind of group separation. Temperature and electro-cardiac measurements taken from participants during the blocks did not differ significantly between conditions, which may also indicate that the experience of a doppelganger was not particularly strong. This research is preliminary in nature, though, and these points can be improved in further studies.</p>
