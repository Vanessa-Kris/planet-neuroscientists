            <p>All successful organisations ensure that their corporate IT strategy is fully and continuously aligned with their business strategy from vision and mission statements, through corporate objectives, business planning and management accounting to individual staff objectives.  Day to day synchronisation of all of these components across all organisational departments, for example Finance, Sales, Delivery, Customer Support, Human Resources and Marketing, is a key objective of corporate IT implementations.  Exploiting the latest technological developments challenges the IT function, however, change (under control) is a positive driver for businesses, usually generating their most profitable business.  I will discuss the component parts of organisations and how they work together and how cognisance and understanding of this is career beneficial, how change is the norm and what personal strategies are key to success.</p>

<p>Our political leanings to the right or left reveal a fundamental aspect of our psyche: how much we’re drawn to stability and security versus change and uncertainty. This manifests in our attitudes and personality traits. For instance, on average, conservatives tend to prefer established hierarchy and are more conscientious. Liberals favour equality and are more open to new experiences. Now in the journal <em>Political Psychology</em> a group led by Aleksandra Cichocka at the University of Kent has <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12327/abstract?campaign=woletoc">extended this line of work</a> by showing the link between political orientation and desire for certainty is reflected at even the most basic of levels: how much we like to use nouns.</p>
<p>Across two initial studies, featuring Polish-speaking survey participants in Poland and Arabic-speaking participants in the Lebanon, the research showed that people with more socially conservative leanings tended to favour nouns over adjectives. For instance, participants with a conservative orientation were more likely to say they’d choose to end the sentence “Magda had no doubts about the success of her business. Magda …” with the noun phrase “is an optimist” than with the adjective phrase “is optimistic”.</p>
<p>This fits with the established link between having a conservative orientation and desiring stability because using a noun to describe someone implies more certainty and permanence about their state of being (past research has shown that even five-year-olds infer more permanence from noun descriptions than adjectival descriptions). Indeed, in the new surveys, the link between conservatism and noun preference seemed to be explained by participants’ relative “need for structure” with high scorers on this measure expressing a dislike of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Cichocka and her colleagues, including John Jost at New York University who is responsible for much of the research in this field, also analysed 101 key speeches delivered by 13 US Presidents, from Roosevelt’s Inaugural Address through to Obama’s State of the Union Address in 2014. They found speeches by Republican presidents featured a greater proportion of nouns compared with their Democrat counterparts.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers said their results “are compatible with previous work suggesting that language reflects, among other things, the individual’s goals and motives, including his or her political goals.”</p>

            Two new papers urge scientists to make research more reproducible.



First off, Russ Poldrack and colleagues writing in Nature Reviews Neuroscience discuss how to achieve transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research. Neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, are enormously powerful tools for neuroscientists but, Poldrack et al. say, they are at risk of "a ‘perfect storm’ of irreproducible results", driven by the "high dimensionality of fMRI data, the relatively low power of most fMRI

<p>Work is getting stale, and you’ve recently been courted by an exciting new company for a great role, the one drawback being a slight pay cut. Before you’ve made up your mind, your manager asks you whether you have plans to go elsewhere. If you wanted to avoid showing your hand, you could lie blatantly. You could change the topic. Or, you could palter: use a truthful statement to create a misleading impression.</p>
<p>“Financially, you’re treating me really well and I don’t think there’s anything out there that could match that.”</p>
<p>Paltering is the topic of a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-59847-001/">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. The authors, Todd Rogers and others at Harvard University, focused on negotiation situations, where access to accurate information had concrete consequences. They found that paltering is fairly common – real-life negotiators reported doing it more frequently then telling a lie, and as commonly as neglecting to share information – and that one reason for this is that they believed it wasn’t such a big deal as lying. In this, they were sadly mistaken.</p>
<p><span id="more-16859"></span></p>
<p>In one experiment, 130 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website imagined trying to use eBay to sell a car with generally positive features but that sometimes mysteriously failed to start. When a prospective customer asked if there were any engine problems, the researchers told some participants to imagine that they parried the question by using a palter: emphasising the (true) fact that the car mostly ran very smoothly. Other participants were asked to play the role of the customer, and to imagine their feelings after discovering this deception post-purchase.</p>
<p>When asked to rate their own honesty in the negotiation, the seller participants rated themselves as 3.4, not too far below the mid-point on the 7-point rating scale. But the buyer participants rated the same transaction as significantly less honest, an average of just 2.5. This makes sense because unlike an outright liar, a palterer has recourse to the justification “I didn’t actually say anything untrue” to maintain their self-image as basically decent, but the victim has the same harsh experience of being deceived, regardless of the method. A follow-up study showed that people feel less comfortable paltering when responding to a direct question, conscious of the fact that their counterpart was explicitly seeking information that was then deliberately denied. But they felt that slipping in misdirection as part of a broader patter was easier to excuse.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at the material consequences of paltering as a form of deception, this time in a more complex negotiation with all participants acting as a seller and subjected to paltering by the buyer. The participants’ task was to sell a plot of land, the worth of which depended on whether it was to be used residentially or for (much more profitable) commercial use. A research assistant acted as a prospective buyer, and participants were encouraged to use part of the discussion to find out what the buyer would use the plot for. The buyer’s true aim was indeed commercial, and in one condition they openly admitted this in response to questioning. In another condition, the buyer overtly lied, claiming the use would be for residential building. And in a third key condition, the buyer paltered: emphasising the true fact that they had only been involved in residential developments to date.</p>
<p>Participants had to make a secret offer, hoping to get the highest sale price they could but knowing that it would be automatically rejected if it was beyond the buyer’s budget. When met with a lie or palter, participants made weaker, more tentative bids, and afterwards reported their suspicion that the buyer didn’t have the budget associated with a commercial bid. When the truth was revealed – the buyer had commercial plans and a big budget – participants judged both acts of deception as equally bad, expressing a disinclination to enter business relations with either type of dissembler in the future. Paltering paid off in the short term, but got punished.</p>
<p>Paltering then, is a form of deception that’s effective at actively leading other parties to false conclusions, just like straight-out lying. Perpetrators can enjoy a sense of plausible deniability, as the statements are technically true, but the harm they cause to their relationships is no less palpable.</p>

 Spliceosome rearrangements facilitated by RNA helicase Prp16 before catalytic step 2 of splicing are poorly understood. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human spliceosomal C complex stalled directly after Prp16 action (C*). The architecture of the catalytic U2-U6 RNP core of the human C* spliceosome is highly similar to that of the yeast pre-Prp16 C complex. However, in C* the branched intron region is separated (by ~20 Å) from the catalytic centre, and its position close to the U6 snRNA ACAGA box is stabilised by interactions with the Prp8 RNase H-like and Prp17 WD40 domains. RNA helicase Prp22 is located about 100 Å from the catalytic centre, suggesting that it destabilises the spliced mRNA after step 2 from a distance. Comparison of the structure of the yeast C and human C* complexes reveals numerous RNP rearrangements that are likely to be facilitated by Prp16, including a large-scale movement of the U2 snRNP.

 The spliceosome excises introns from pre-mRNAs in two sequential trans-esterifications – branching and exon ligation1 – catalysed at a single catalytic metal site in U6 snRNA2,3. The recent structures of the spliceosomal C complex4,5 with the cleaved 5’-exon and lariat—3’-exon bound to the catalytic centre revealed that branching-specific factors such as Cwc25 lock the branch helix into position for nucleophilic attack of the branch adenosine at the 5’-splice site. Furthermore, the ATPase Prp16 is positioned to bind and translocate the intron downstream of the branch point to destabilize branching-specific factors and release the branch helix from the active site4. Here we present the 3.8 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome stalled after Prp16-mediated remodelling but prior to exon ligation. While the U6 snRNA catalytic core remains firmly held in the active site cavity of Prp8 by proteins common to both steps, the branch helix has rotated by 75 degrees compared to complex C and is stabilized into a new position by Prp17, Cef1, and the reoriented Prp8 RNaseH domain. This rotation of the branch helix removes the branch adenosine from the catalytic core, creates a space for 3’-exon docking, and restructures the pairing of the 5’-splice site with the U6 snRNA ACAGAGA region. Slu7 and Prp18, which promote exon ligation, bind together to the Prp8 RNaseH domain. The ATPase Prp22, bound to Prp8 in place of Prp16, could interact with the 3’-exon, suggesting a possible basis for mRNA release after exon ligation6,7. Together with the C complex structure4, our new C* complex structure reveals the two major conformations of the spliceosome during the catalytic stages of splicing.

            <p>Quality control mechanisms intervene appropriately when defective translation events occur, in order to preserve the integrity of protein synthesis. Rescue of ribosomes translating on messenger RNAs that lack stop codons is one of the co-translational quality control pathways. In many bacteria, ArfA recognizes stalled ribosomes and recruits the release factor RF2, which catalyses the termination of protein synthesis. Although an induced-fit mechanism of nonstop mRNA surveillance mediated by ArfA and RF2 has been reported, the molecular interaction between ArfA and RF2 in the ribosome that is responsible for the mechanism is unknown. Here we report an electron cryo-microscopy structure of ArfA and RF2 in complex with the 70S ribosome bound to a nonstop mRNA. The structure, which is consistent with our kinetic and biochemical data, reveals the molecular interactions that enable ArfA to specifically recruit RF2, not RF1, into the ribosome and to enable RF2 to release the truncated protein product in this co-translational quality control pathway. The positively charged C-terminal domain of ArfA anchors in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. Furthermore, binding of ArfA and RF2 induces conformational changes in the ribosomal decoding centre that are similar to those seen in other protein-involved decoding processes. Specific interactions between residues in the N-terminal domain of ArfA and RF2 help RF2 to adopt a catalytically competent conformation for peptide release. Our findings provide a framework for understanding recognition of the translational state of the ribosome by new proteins, and expand our knowledge of the decoding potential of the ribosome.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21053">doi: 10.1038/nature21053</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/rqgQ2n-Uk8Q" width="1" />

 We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects tumour initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the transition from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of inducible SOX2, which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers, we show that despite widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, certain oncogenic mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation factor eIF2A is essential for cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation at these upstream sites, differentially skewing translation and protein expression. Our findings unveil a role for the translation of 5′ untranslated regions in cancer, and expose new targets for therapeutic intervention.

 Picornaviruses are a leading cause of human and veterinary infections that result in various diseases, including polio and the common cold. As archetypical non-enveloped viruses, their biology has been extensively studied. Although a range of different cell-surface receptors are bound by different picornaviruses, it is unclear whether common host factors are needed for them to reach the cytoplasm. Using genome-wide haploid genetic screens, here we identify the lipid-modifying enzyme PLA2G16 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) as a picornavirus host factor that is required for a previously unknown event in the viral life cycle. We find that PLA2G16 functions early during infection, enabling virion-mediated genome delivery into the cytoplasm, but not in any virion-assigned step, such as cell binding, endosomal trafficking or pore formation. To resolve this paradox, we screened for suppressors of the ΔPLA2G16 phenotype and identified a mechanism previously implicated in the clearance of intracellular bacteria. The sensor of this mechanism, galectin-8 (encoded by LGALS8), detects permeated endosomes and marks them for autophagic degradation, whereas PLA2G16 facilitates viral genome translocation and prevents clearance. This study uncovers two competing processes triggered by virus entry: activation of a pore-activated clearance pathway and recruitment of a phospholipase to enable genome release.

 The origin and cellular complexity of eukaryotes represent a major enigma in biology. Current data support scenarios in which an archaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial (mitochondrial) endosymbiont merged together, resulting in the first eukaryotic cell. The host cell is related to Lokiarchaeota, an archaeal phylum with many eukaryotic features. The emergence of the structural complexity that characterizes eukaryotic cells remains unclear. Here we describe the ‘Asgard’ superphylum, a group of uncultivated archaea that, as well as Lokiarchaeota, includes Thor-, Odin- and Heimdallarchaeota. Asgard archaea affiliate with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and their genomes are enriched for proteins formerly considered specific to eukaryotes. Notably, thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains. Furthermore, we identify thorarchaeal proteins with similar features to eukaryotic coat proteins involved in vesicle biogenesis. Our results expand the known repertoire of ‘eukaryote-specific’ proteins in Archaea, indicating that the archaeal host cell already contained many key components that govern eukaryotic cellular complexity.

 The human large intestine is populated by a high density of microorganisms, collectively termed the colonic microbiota, which has an important role in human health and nutrition. The survival of microbiota members from the dominant Gram-negative phylum Bacteroidetes depends on their ability to degrade dietary glycans that cannot be metabolized by the host. The genes encoding proteins involved in the degradation of specific glycans are organized into co-regulated polysaccharide utilization loci, with the archetypal locus sus (for starch utilisation system) encoding seven proteins, SusA–SusG. Glycan degradation mainly occurs intracellularly and depends on the import of oligosaccharides by an outer membrane protein complex composed of an extracellular SusD-like lipoprotein and an integral membrane SusC-like TonB-dependent transporter. The presence of the partner SusD-like lipoprotein is the major feature that distinguishes SusC-like proteins from previously characterized TonB-dependent transporters. Many sequenced gut Bacteroides spp. encode over 100 SusCD pairs, of which the majority have unknown functions and substrate specificities. The mechanism by which extracellular substrate binding by SusD proteins is coupled to outer membrane passage through their cognate SusC transporter is unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of two functionally distinct SusCD complexes purified from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and derive a general model for substrate translocation. The SusC transporters form homodimers, with each β-barrel protomer tightly capped by SusD. Ligands are bound at the SusC–SusD interface in a large solvent-excluded cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations and single-channel electrophysiology reveal a ‘pedal bin’ mechanism, in which SusD moves away from SusC in a hinge-like fashion in the absence of ligand to expose the substrate-binding site to the extracellular milieu. These data provide mechanistic insights into outer membrane nutrient import by members of the microbiota, an area of major importance for understanding human–microbiota symbiosis.

            <p>Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical role in many cell-signalling pathways but is often difficult to define or predict. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 α-helical oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT, one of the proteins with the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand, bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus sugar transporter SemiSWEET, another protein with low oligomeric stability, cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and stable interactions within a range of α-helical membrane proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors.</p><p>Nature  1 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20820">doi: 10.1038/nature20820</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/tqAHMTxX-iE" width="1" />

            <p>
 As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their microenvironment and can activate autophagy, a catabolic process which provides nutrients during starvation. How tumours regulate autophagy in vivo and whether autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial. Here we demonstrate, using a well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model, that non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically restrained using autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion are genetically dependent on autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. Induction of autophagy is mediated by Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed tumour cells, whereas tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that dormant growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous growth when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts. We conclude that transformed cells engage surrounding normal cells as active and essential microenvironmental contributors to early tumour growth through nutrient-generating autophagy.

 Hyoliths are abundant and globally distributed ‘shelly’ fossils that appear early in the Cambrian period and can be found throughout the 280 million year span of Palaeozoic strata. The ecological and evolutionary importance of this group has remained unresolved, largely because of their poorly constrained soft anatomy and idiosyncratic scleritome, which comprises an operculum, a conical shell and, in some taxa, a pair of lateral spines (helens). Since their first description over 175 years ago, hyoliths have most often been regarded as incertae sedis, related to molluscs or assigned to their own phylum. Here we examine over 1,500 specimens of the mid-Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerstätten. We reconstruct Haplophrentis as a semi-sessile, epibenthic suspension feeder that could use its helens to elevate its tubular body above the sea floor. Exceptionally preserved soft tissues include an extendable, gullwing-shaped, tentacle-bearing organ surrounding a central mouth, which we interpret as a lophophore, and a U-shaped digestive tract ending in a dorsolateral anus. Together with opposing bilateral sclerites and a deep ventral visceral cavity, these features indicate an affinity with the lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids and tommotiids), substantially increasing the morphological disparity of this prominent group.

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/795530330052493312">recently reported</a> that <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/14/037549">one of my papers</a> has been rejected by PLoS Computational Biology after 10 months and 4 revisions, on the ground of general interest. This has generated a little buzz. A colleague mentioned it on his blog. As a result, the editor of my paper contacted him directly to tell his version of the story, which my colleague has now <a href="https://medium.com/@drmdhumphries/thats-another-fine-mess-you-ve-got-us-into-peer-review-b75a9aa11034">reported on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the editor’s story is “misleading”, to be polite. It is a shame that the review process is confidential, as it allows the journal to hide what actually happens behind their closed doors. Nevertheless, I have asked the journal for the authorization to publish the content of my appeal and their response, where I explain what happened in more detail (and more accurately). They have accepted. I have removed names of the persons involved. This illustrates one of the flaws of the current peer-review system (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/my-new-year-resolution-to-help-move-science-to-the-post-journal-world/">this post</a> for how it could work better).</p>
<p>(Just one note: the editor has apparently told my colleague that the third reviewer was a collaborator, so they could not take into account his review. Well, that’s a lie. I know because he chose to sign his review. The "collaboration" was the scientist sending me published data.)</p>
<p>So here it is.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Re: Manuscript PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00007R4</p>
<p>So after 10 months and 4 revisions, our paper has been rejected, following the recommendation of one reviewer, because it is not considered of broad enough interest. I quote from the final editorial message: “We regret that the specific hypothesis that your manuscript is geared to dispute does not reach that level of general interest.”.</p>
<p>These facts being recalled, it should be obvious enough that the editorial process has gone very wrong. There were no more technical criticisms already after revision 2, on July 8th, 4 months ago, and the paper should have been accepted then. I have repeatedly asked the editors to explain why we were required to justify novelty and significance after having been required to do so much work on technical aspects. But the editors have refused to answer this simple query. Frankly, I was expecting a bit more respect for the authors that make this journal, and I do not think that explaining the journal’s policy and the decisions is so much to ask. All I know is Michael Eisen’s view, founding editor of this journal, who has cared to comment “I agree - a paper going out for review should mean it is of interest”.</p>
<p>This editorial process has gone beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my career in terms of absurdity and waste. Why scientists (“peers”) would voluntarily make each other’s life so unnecessarily hard instead of cooperating and debating is beyond my understanding. In the end it appears that the ego of one (important?) reviewer matters more than science, and that is very sad. This being said, I have been notified that appeals are only considered when “a) a reviewer or editor is thought to have made a significant factual error” or “b) his/her objectivity is compromised by a documented competing interest”, and since bureaucracy apparently beats reason and ethics, I will now explain how this applies.</p>
<p>I have already explained at length the factual errors of the first reviewer, who is apparently the only one that is trusted by the editors. This editorial message repeats some of them (no, we are not criticizing simulation results of a particular model, but the biophysical interpretation (what goes on physically), and we did so in several state-of-the-art biophysical models, not one). I will therefore focus on case (b), and attach my previous letter to the editors for reference; please also read the responses to reviewers as regards case (a), in particular to reviewer-editor Dr. YYY who has unfortunately not cared to reply to our point-by-point response that he had required from us. The editorial decisions that have led to rejecting the paper on the basis of general interest after 10 months are so bizarre that I am compelled to question senior editor Dr. YYY’s objectivity – I presume that Dr. XXX, who sent the paper for review in the first place, does consider the paper of interest. The sequence of facts speaks for itself:</p>
<p>- On June 6th (revision #2), the editorial message reads “We understand that Reviewer 2 was very enthusiastic, and Reviewer 3 had relatively minor comments, but we both stress that addressing Reviewer 1's reservations are essential. Indeed, it is only fair to say that it seems to us that it will be challenging to address these comments in the context of the presented results.”. The exclusive reliance on one reviewer and the presumption that we could not address the comments is rather surprising. Nonetheless, the editorial message that followed was exclusively about the match with experimental data, not about interest (“the reviewer's point about (apparently) unrealistic voltage dependencies of the currents […]”). We did successfully address these comments, pointing out that the reviewer had made factual errors (such as misreading the figure he was commenting, and discussing the results of an experimental paper he had not opened).</p>
<p>- On July 8th (revision #3), the editorial message was now asking to explain the novelty compared to what we had done in the past (and published in the same journal), blindly following the 3-sentence report of reviewer #1, and making no mention whatsoever to the fact that we had just answered the major (and flawed) criticisms on experimental observations, which constituted the previous editorial message. At this point we complained that we were asked to justify the novelty of our study 7 months after submission, especially when it was explicit in the introduction; nonetheless, we complied and explained again.</p>
<p>- On August 25th (revision #4), we were appalled to read that, instead of finally accepting the paper, senior editor Dr. YYY decided to nominate himself as a reviewer, admitting that “the latest revision is first one he has had the chance to read”. The report was not an assessment of the novelty of the paper, as would have been logical since this was what the previous editorial message was about. Instead, it was a 6 pages long report full of technical queries, making negative criticisms that, for most of them, had already been addressed in previous reports, and asking for substantial modifications of the paper.</p>
<p>- At this point, I replied to the editorial message and obtained no response; as the message stated “If you would like to discuss anything, please don't hesitate to contact either of us directly”, I emailed Dr. YYY, and he started his response as follows: “To answer your email, allow me to be brief, because this sort of exchange should really be going through the journal, and indeed that will be the case from now on.”. Nonetheless, we exchanged a few emails, in which he offered no explanation; in the end we agreed that I would write a point-by-point response to his six-page review, but not modify the paper. I submitted it, together with a response to the first reviewer, and a letter to the editors, on September 22nd.</p>
<p>- Three weeks later, on October 10th, I received a message where I was asked to edit the letter so that it could be passed on to the reviewers. Apparently the editors had not noticed the response to reviewers. It still took them three weeks to read a letter, which, considering the history of this paper, does not strike me as very respectful. I complained to Dr. YYY, who replied “We believe that you have been adequately notified by the PLoS administrative team concerning the status of your revision.”. I had to exchange several emails with Dr. XXX who realized the error. I received no apology from Dr. YYY.</p>
<p>- On November 11th, I received the reject decision, together with the response of reviewer #1 and, oddly enough, of reviewer #3 to which I had not replied (since there was no remaining comment). He also was surprised, since he wrote “I don’t have the expertise, authority or, honestly, the time to judge whether the new comments from Reviewers 1 &amp; 4 are fair, or whether the authors’ responses have fully addressed them – this is clearly a job for the Editors (although hopefully not for the Editor who just became a Reviewer)”. But, editor-reviewer #4 Dr. YYY did not bother replying to my point-by-point response, which he had explicitly required.</p>
<p>- The final decision comes with excuses that are frankly hard to swallow. One is that the editors had failed to see the word “models” in the title. In 10 months and 4 revisions! Who can seriously believe that? And yes, the paper is about models – it is a computational biology journal (note that we have also successfully related the models to experimental observations, on request of the editors). The other excuse is that an anonymous reviewer (reviewer #2) had a conflict of interest and his reviews had to be dismissed. I am of course fine with that decision (let me simply state for the record that none of reviewers I have suggested are in such a position). But this happened in April, more than 6 months ago. Quite appropriately, the editor Dr. XXX asked for another reviewer who identified himself (Dr. ZZZ). Dr. ZZZ wrote a positive review, and in addition he read our responses to the other reviewers and wrote “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.”. At this point, given that no objection had been raised by any reviewer or editor on methods, results or clarity, the paper should have been accepted. Instead, the editors decided to follow a nonsensical comment from reviewer #1 alone: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists”, which was not even consistent with his/her own first positive assessment (“this is an interesting paper”). Given that Dr. XXX sent the paper for review in the first place, this decision must originate from Dr. YYY (who at this point had not read the paper, by his own admission). I am compelled to conclude that Dr. YYY has not been objective, and in fact has been actively blocking our paper. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I witness the questionable attitude of Dr. YYY, as he has recently been a reviewer for an essay I wrote. The review process was extremely long, went over multiple rounds with massive lists of requests, where Dr. YYY basically wanted to rewrite the text to follow his own views and style. During the review process, Dr. YYY contacted me directly by email to discuss the paper, going so far as asking for co-authorship (“Indeed, the level of suggestions are approaching collaboration on this paper- something I would be happy with but I assume is not what you have in mind.”). In the same email, and while the review process was not over, he asked me for an experimental collaboration – which of course I have not followed up. I had to ask the editor to intervene to stop the madness – which he did: “Indeed your paper has been unduly delayed and I have asked the reviewer to answer me within 24 hours.”. I apologize for disclosing these email excerpts, but I have no other choice since I am asked to provide documentation. It is clear that, had I imagined that Dr. YYY could be chosen as a reviewer (which seemed unlikely given his recent track record), I would have opposed him. But I did not anticipate that he would nominate himself, or overthrow the editor’s decision without even reading my paper (by his own admission).</p>
<p>Therefore, I am asking that Dr. YYY is replaced by a new senior editor with a more reasonable attitude.</p>
<p>As far as I can see: 1) the three reviewers were initially positive on the interest of the paper; 2) the editor Dr. XXX, who as far as I can tell is the only scientist involved in this process who is a member of the computational biology community, supported our paper since he sent it for review; 3) one reviewer, who seems to be an experimental electrophysiologist (unfortunately he or she has decided to remain anonymous), reverted his subjective opinion on the paper’s interest after we have pointed out the errors in his/her report, and even then, still judged the paper interesting for the computational neuroscience community. I have failed to see to how the decision is “not trivial to reach”.</p>

<p>Attached: Letter to the editors from September 16th</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Letter to the editors, September 16th</strong></p>
<p>Dear Editors,</p>
<p>In the previous revision, I raised serious objections regarding the abusive attitude of reviewer #1. These objections have apparently been completely dismissed, but what I have been most disappointed about is the total lack of response to these objections. I am writing this letter in the hope that this time it will be given some consideration.</p>
<p>This manuscript has been submitted 8 months ago. This is the fourth major revision that we have been asked to make. The responses are now totaling more than 25 pages, much longer than the article itself. We have now entered a phase where a large part of the responses consist in citing previous revisions where the issues have already been addressed. This revision reaches a new level, where a fourth reviewer is added and repeats mostly questions that we have already answered in previous revisions. Why a fourth reviewer is considered necessary after 8 months of revision is not clear, when none of the three reviewers has raised any serious concern.</p>
<p>I have officially asked a detailed explanation for this peculiar decision. The only response I have obtained so far is that there was “a tie” between “conflicting reviews”. So apparently the editorial decision has been based on a vote between reviewers. This is yet what I read on the journal’s website:</p>
<p><i>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comment that may help the editors to make a decision. That said, decisions are not necessarily made according to majority rule. Instead, the editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers. </i></p>
<p>If one followed this process, then one would realize that:</p>
<p>- None of the three reviewers has any remaining objection about results, methods, or clarity of the text.</p>
<p>- Reviewer #2 and #3 have an overall very positive assessment of the paper and in particular of its interest. Rev #2: “This is a great revision. The authors have clarified and addressed all my previous concerns. […] I strongly believe the study is publishable as it stands”; Rev# 3: “This is a very clear and logically presented manuscript dealing with a key question in fundamental cellular neuroscience”.</p>
<p>- On his/her first report, reviewer #1 also made a positive assessment of the paper and of its interest: “This is a clearly written manuscript that addresses an interesting question regarding the nature of spike initiation. Specifically, the authors propose a plausible explanation […] This is an interesting paper.”.</p>
<p>- After two rounds of technical revisions, in which we pointed out the reviewer’s errors and to which no objection has been made, reviewer #1 changed his mood and now concludes, without any argument: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (sic).</p>
<p>- Reviewer #3 has read our responses to the two other reviewers and concluded: “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.” From these facts, it appears clearly that there are in fact 3 convergent reviews. All 3 reviewers have concluded that results and methods are rigorous and the text is well written. All 3 reviewers have found the paper interesting. It might be that reviewer #1 has “voted” negatively; however I would expect the editorial decision to be based on the content of reviews and responses, which in this case is convergent, and not on the mood of one reviewer, which in this case is inconsistent between the reports. It is my understanding that an editorial decision should be based on arguments and facts, not on the reviewer’s emotions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have replied in detail, again, to all criticisms. We have pointed out in particular the factual errors of reviewer #1. To help the editors, we have underlined the important points. We would appreciate if the editors checked for themselves whether reviewer #1 is right or not. We have also replied to reviewer/senior editor Dr YYY, although I deeply regret that this fourth version is “the first one he has had the chance to read”.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to call your attention on the conclusion of reviewer #1, on which his/her recommendation is based, which requires in my opinion a clarification from the journal: “Finally, now in their third revision, the authors acknowledge that this work strongly builds on the previous resistive-coupling hypothesis, and tests whether this hypothesis is compatible with sharp spike onset (a view they have already proposed), vs the alternative proposed by Yu, of back propagation. This very specific theoretical result I feel is unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (Please see also our response, pointing out that the said acknowledgement was clear already in the very first version.)</p>
<p>This recommendation makes some important presumptions about this journal’s editorial views. Therefore I would very much like to know if this journal:</p>
<p>- also considers that proposing a hypothesis is more important than testing one, and that only the former should be published;</p>
<p>- considers that interesting computational neuroscience studies do not belong to this journal. I would also very much like to know if this journal considers that it is ok for a reviewer to ask for substantial technical revisions when he/she has already decided that the paper should not be published anyway. This has been indeed a lot of work for a decision ultimately based on the mood of one reviewer.</p>
<p>As I have argued in this letter, it is very clear that, given the content of the reports of the 3 reviewers and of our responses, this manuscript should have been accepted already. After 8 months and 4 revisions, and no serious objection on the manuscript, I can only hope very much that this journal does not confuse rigorous peer review with author harassment.</p>
<p>Again, I am hoping that this letter will be seriously taken into consideration, and even perhaps responded to.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Romain Brette</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Response of the editors-in-chief</strong></p>
<p>Dear Dr. Brette,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response to the recent decision on your paper “The Basis of Sharp Spike Onset in Standard Biophysical Models”. The manuscript and your appeal letter have been carefully evaluated by Dr. XXX and the journal’s Editors-in-Chief.</p>
<p>We understand your frustration regarding the length and complexity of the review process, and we would like to apologize for the time taken to reach a final decision.</p>
<p>We would like to provide some further clarification on how the editorial decision was reached. The manuscript addresses the issue - how do cortical neuronal action potentials rise so sharply? – and after an initial evaluation, Dr. XXX found it interesting enough to merit sending out for review, so that the reviewers could assess the technical solidity of the work and the conceptual advance proposed. The paper received mixed reviews, and hence merited a revision. After several rounds of revision, Reviewer 1 remained unconvinced. In order to aid the review process, Dr. YYY volunteered to evaluate the paper in depth, and his opinion concurred with that of Reviewer 1. Dr. XXX also re-read the paper and came to the conclusion that this manuscript is critically close conceptually to the previous PLOS publications - in fact the idea was laid out clearly and beautifully in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers. The present manuscript is an implementation of this idea, showing that other biophysically realistic models used to examine the spike sharpness issue show the mechanism that was suggested in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers.</p>
<p>We regret that this did not become fully clear before the third revision, and we understand your disappointment with the final outcome.</p>
<p>However, we agree that the findings of the paper are not significant enough for PLOS Computational Biology, and we will not be reconsidering the paper. We are sorry not to be more encouraging, but we hope that you can understand the reasons for this decision.</p>

White-tailed deer, for example, are found from Central America to southern Canada. Another example is the grey wolf, which historically ranged throughout most of North America, Asia, and Europe, from the high arctic to the sub-tropics. These broad distributions suggest a tolerance to environmental differences on the part of large-bodied species.</p>
<p>An interesting and perplexing pattern in the palaeoecological record is that large-bodied dinosaurs, at least in the Cretaceous of North America, do not appear to have followed this trend of very broad distributions. During this time, North America was often bisected by a large shallow sea (the Western Interior Seaway), and dinosaurs in western North America lived on a relatively narrow strip of land (sometimes referred to as Laramidia).</p>

<p>A long-standing explanation for the high diversity of dinosaurs across this relatively small landmass is that they were highly sensitive to environmental differences (particularly distance from the sea), and as a result different large-bodied species would share non-overlapping ranges despite sometimes being found less than a few hundred kilometres apart.</p>
<p>Our goal was to test this hypothesis of dinosaur environmental sensitivity. We wanted to see if in two environmentally different, but time equivalent settings, dinosaurs showed ecologically distinct trends in occurrence and abundance. To do this, we needed to show what the overall pattern in vertebrate community structure was in these two settings, and in the broader context of environmental change over time in this region.</p>
<p>We collected data from dozens of vertebrate microfossil sites (or microsites for short). Microsites are concentrations of small vertebrate fossils representing a palaeocommunity from a short time interval, and are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/origins-of-microfossil-bonebeds-insights-from-the-upper-cretaceous-judith-river-formation-of-north-central-montana/06F4B6D9881C06B6D98EBC94F5C43C04">thought to have formed in low energy ponds and rivers</a>, acting as sink for material from the region. The relative abundance of different groups can be counted and compared between sites to identify how the community is changing temporally, geographically, and environmentally.</p>
<p>All of the microsites we analyzed were collected from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, in two geographically distinct sampling areas, and all from a geological unit called the <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/e93-016#.WCX0fOErJE4">Belly River Group</a>. Sediments of this unit record a transition from marine to terrestrial setting, which is followed by a mostly terrestrial component (reconstructed primarily as an upper coastal plain, like inland Louisiana today), and finally a shift back to more marine influence (a lower coastal plain, similar to the Mississippi delta of southern Louisiana).</p>
<p>Due to the depositional history of the area, there is a time-equivalent interval where one of the sampling regions records a lower coastal plain environment, and the other sampling region records an upper coastal plain environment. This provides the temporally equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in which to test our hypotheses.</p>
<p>We found that the relative abundances of vertebrates in the palaeocommunities preserved in these microsites changed in response to fluctuations in sea level. The largest change was an inverse shift in abundance between sharks/rays and amphibians, with the former dominant in marine-influenced intervals and the latter dominant in terrestrial-influenced intervals. While not surprising, that result confirms that these communities are responding to environmental changes, and that our analyses can detect that.</p>
<p>The next step was to analyze sub-sets of the data, specifically the time-equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in the two sampling areas. We found that dinosaurs, and particularly large-bodied groups, did not vary to any noticeable degree in their relative abundances through this time-equivalent interval. In fact they were highly similar in abundances in both environments.</p>

<p>Our results indicate that this long held notion of dinosaurs being highly sensitive to environment and sea-level may not be correct. But then what explains the high diversity of large-bodied dinosaur species present across the Cretaceous of North America? Some of the distant regions of western North America may <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rCDYCQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=sullivan+lucas+2006&amp;ots=c__sAkVIJ2&amp;sig=KnMPdsSfJwEc-TzKgLbSxA6N5XM#v=onepage&amp;q=sullivan%20lucas%202006&amp;f=false">not be as geologically time-equivalent as we currently think</a>, or were isolated geographically in some way that prevented migration.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that despite not being particularly sensitive environmentally, that dinosaurs were partitioning their ecological niches in other ways that allowed for this diversity, such as a <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6785-13-14">restriction on feeding heights</a> or a dietary preference for particular plants. Perhaps primary productivity during this time was sufficiently high that competition was lower and strict niche partitioning was not required.</p>
<p>Our study addresses a long-standing question in dinosaur ecology, though it alone cannot provide the full answer. Many dinosaur teeth can only be diagnosed to the family or subfamily, not the species. So while we focused on trends in major dinosaur groups, additional work must be done to locate more of the much rarer dinosaur macrofossils in order to completely address what is driving dinosaur species distributions.</p>

<p>The traffic lights turn amber: should you brake or accelerate on through? If there’s a teenager at the wheel, the chances are he or she will put their foot down and keep going. Teenagers love taking risks, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896475/">more so than any other age group</a>. This is partly down to the immaturity of the teen brain: they do not yet show the same connectivity between frontal decision making areas and deeper reward-related brain areas, as compared with adults. But there’s also a social element. When an adult is around, teens tend to take fewer risks, and their brains show less reward-related activity after taking a risk, a phenomenon that psychologists call “social scaffolding” because it is as if the adult presence is helping the teen to attain adult-like behaviour. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12484/abstract">new study</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em> builds on these findings and makes the claim that a teenager’s brain is influenced to a greater extent by the presence of his or her mother than by an unfamiliar adult. <span id="more-16708"></span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<p>João Moreira and his colleagues scanned the brains of 23 15-year-olds (9 girls) while they played a risk-based game that involved going through a set of 26 traffic lights as quickly as possible and deciding at each set whether to accelerate or brake as the lights turned amber. Accelerating saved time usually, but also carried the risk of a crash which would lead to a greater delay than braking. The teens played the game twice: once in the presence of their mother who was located in the scan control room, and the other time in the presence of an unfamiliar female professor who was described as an expert in adolescent driving behaviour (some played the game with mum present first, others with the stranger present first).</p>
<p>There was a tendency for the teens to take fewer risks when their mum was present, as compared with the professor, but this difference didn’t reach statistical significance. However, at a neural level there were statistically significant differences between the conditions: when mum was present, the teens’ brains showed more reward-related brain activity after making safe decisions and less reward-related brain activity after making risky decisions. Mum’s supervision seemed to make caution a more pleasurable approach, at least at a neural level.</p>
<p>There was also an important difference between conditions in terms of the functional connectivity between decision making and reward-related brain regions in the brain. In the mum condition, but not the adult stranger condition, there was a negative correlation in the activity between these regions: a more mature pattern typical of that seen in adults.</p>
<p>Finally, the teens’ brains showed more activity in regions associated with perspective-taking when taking risks in the mum condition, perhaps suggesting they were concerned with what she might think.</p>
<p>The researchers interpreted their findings as suggesting there is something unique about the influence of a parent (or a mother, at least) on the way a teenager’s brain processes risk, which could have practical implications. For example risk-prevention educational programmes for teenagers, which often struggle to make a difference, might be more likely to be effective if parents are directly involved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study is hampered by several methodological issues such as the small sample size and the lack of a baseline control condition: the latter means it’s not clear if differences between the conditions are caused by the benefits of a mother’s presence or the opposite effect of an unfamiliar adult. Also, many issues are left unanswered, such as: would a father have the same apparent effect as a mother? And does the quality of the parent-teen relationship matter?</p>

<p>As one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in clinical practice, neck pain is a common topic in <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em>. However, this case report by Mourad and colleagues describes a patient presenting with neck pain, occipital headache and dizziness, which diagnostic imaging revealed to be caused by a basilar impression (an upward displacement of vertebral elements into the foramen magnum as a result of bone softening) rather than a musculoskeletal cause. Although fairly uncommon it can be dangerous as congenital basilar impression often remains asymptomatic and undiagnosed into adulthood. When symptomatic, neck pain is one of its most ubiquitous symptoms occurring in 59% of patients. This case report highlights the importance of considering non-musculoskeletal, rare pathologic disorders such as basilar impression within the screening and differential diagnosis of neck pain. It also demonstrates the capability of physiotherapists to screen for pathologic medical conditions and identify when patient’s symptoms are beyond the scope of physiotherapy.</p>

<p>In January, Dunning and colleagues published the first randomized control trial which compared the effectiveness of manipulation versus mobilization paired with cranio-cervical flexion exercise in ameliorating symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache (headaches arising from musculoskeletal dysfunctions in the cervical spine). The study investigated the issue of best practice in the treatment of these headaches, which has been contentious due to the potential risks associated with manipulation.</p>
<p>The findings demonstrated that manipulation produced significantly greater reductions in headache intensity, frequency and duration as well as reductions in disability and medication intake when compared with mobilization and exercise. The study provides a baseline for treatment of cervicogenic headache, which suggests manipulation as the more efficacious in terms of symptom reduction, and also indicates the need for further research to determine the relative effectiveness of different types and dosages of manipulation.</p>

This systematic review synthesized evidence from 13 observational studies (417 shoulders) on intra- and peri-articular pathophysiologic changes seen in patients affected by primary frozen shoulder. The findings highlight that the anterior shoulder structures are the areas of greatest pathologic change in this condition. However, the study also identified that a lack of evidence with a low risk of bias, non-standardized inclusion criteria and poorly reported study characteristics preclude the production of comparable results and therefore a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of primary frozen shoulder. Ryan and colleagues suggest that a consensus regarding inclusion criteria is required before future studies can investigate tissue changes at defined stages to better understand the disease continuum and inform stage-specific management of this condition.</p>

<p>Khan et al. described the results of a longitudinal cohort study and provided the first independent longitudinal association between increasing severity of meniscal tears and worsening knee pain. It also validated previous studies by demonstrating the majority of meniscal tears (55/63) affected the medial meniscus, where the medial posterior site was the most prevalent tear location. Additionally, this study identified risk factors for tear worsening, including high BMI and osteophytes at first visit, which provides a baseline for recognizing patients where tears are likely to increase in severity. Significantly, this study showed that 16% of tears consistently increased in severity over the 8 year follow-up period, highlighting the importance of early effective management.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that patients with medially located tendon pain and a thickened plantaris close the medial Achilles tendon were often unresponsive to standard scraping treatment. Masci and colleagues demonstrated the effective use of a novel imaging technique [Ultrasound Tissue Characterization (UTC)] to diagnose involvement of the plantaris tendon in patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The UTC algorithms allow quantification of the tendon integrity by categorizing grey scale changes into 4 different echo-types related to matrix integrity. These are then characterized on a scale from intact to completely disorganized. This is visualized in the figure below from the publication, which shows focal disorganized echopixels medially (in images A and B), while image C shows the less frequent observation of general disorganized echopixels in both medial and lateral parts.</p>
<p>Although ultrasound and color Doppler indicated plantaris tendon involvement in 20/23 cases, UTC revealed disorganized changes in the medial Achilles midportion in all patients. These changes may indirectly indicate involvement of the plantaris tendon due to its compression on the medial aspect of the Achilles tendon. This study demonstrated the effective utilization of a novel technology (UTC) and addressed the need to diagnose plantaris tendon involvement to inform future clinical management of patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy.</p>

<p>It’s that time of year when many of us are trying our best to begin a new exercise habit. One psychological factor affecting our chances is how we think we’ll feel during the exercise, and how that compares to the way we actually feel when we get going, and how we feel afterwards. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991804">new study</a> in <em>Health Psychology</em> has explored whether it’s possible to increase people’s adherence to a new exercise regime by making their expectations more positive. While the main intervention was a disappointment, there is an encouraging message in the results: moderate-to-vigorous exercise is likely to be more enjoyable than you think, and simply knowing this will probably help you enjoy your exercise even more.</p>
<p><span id="more-16600"></span></p>
<p>Bethany Kwan at University of Colorado School of Medicine and her colleagues recruited 101 healthy young men and women aged 18 to 45. None of them were elite or professional athletes. Their initial challenge was to run for 30 minutes on a treadmill in the lab (at a sustained target intensity of 90 to 100 per cent of their heart rate when first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilatory_threshold">out of breath</a>), and to say how they were feeling at several points throughout and afterwards. The researchers then asked them to repeat the same amount of exercise each day for the next seven days, with their adherence assessed via a heart monitor.</p>
<p>Before the participants began, the researchers asked them how they expected to feel during the exercise. Crucially, the researchers manipulated the expectations of one third of the participants in a positive manner by telling them that most people exercising at this intensity feel good and energised, and then relaxed afterward. In contrast, they told another third of the participants that most people find this intensity of exercise negative and unpleasant, and then they feel tired afterward. The expectations of the remainder of the participants was not manipulated and they acted as controls. After their lab run, the participants said how strongly they intended to keep up the week-long regimen of exercise.</p>
<p>Kwan and her team had hoped that by increasing the positivity of participants’ exercise expectations that these individuals would not only find the lab exercise more positive during and afterwards, but would then show stronger intentions to exercise and better adherence to the regimen. The results were a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Overall, participants found the lab run more pleasant than they thought they would. But participants who were manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable did not exercise more through the following week. In this sense, the main intervention was a failure.</p>
<p>However, participants manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable showed greater increases in positive feelings through the run compared to the negatively manipulated participants; moreover, compared with control participants, they remembered the run as less fatiguing. This last effect, though tentative, could be important because the more positively participants remembered the lab run, the more they tended to run through the ensuing week. This supports the common sense idea that when you’ve finished your exercise, it could be beneficial to focus on those aspects of the experience you enjoyed: doing so might increase the likelihood you’ll give it another go.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results suggest that “healthy individuals will likely find a moderate-to-vigorous exercise stimulus to be more pleasant than they expect it to be” and that encouraging exercisers to focus on the positive aspects of the exercise experience will likely “yield an overall more positive affective experience”. Hopefully the mere act of reading this article will help, by raising your expectations for your own new regime!</p>

 Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted for ubiquitination and Ddb1–cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is, YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate.

            <p>Males of many polygynous species compete for access to fertile females without providing them with resources other than sperm and without investing in care for the offspring (male dominance polygyny). In such systems, local competition for access to females is intense and typically only a few males obtain matings, leading to strong sexual selection. Sampling multiple breeding areas could then provide a mechanism for males to increase their chances to reproduce. However, little is known about such sampling behaviour and about the spatial scale at which males compete. Here we show that most males of a migratory, polygynous shorebird, the pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), that arrived at a known breeding location in northern Alaska subsequently moved through a considerable part of the entire species’ breeding range (up to 13,045 km in a four-week period), sampling as many as 23 additional potential breeding sites. Our data suggest that males do not have a final breeding destination after migration from their wintering quarters, but make nomadic movements that are probably not a consequence of breeding failure. Tenure, the duration of stay at a site, correlated strongly with the number of breeding females at the site, suggesting that decisions to leave are dependent on local mating opportunities. Nomadic movements may allow males to display and sire offspring at multiple sites within a single breeding season. Sexual selection may then favour high-performance males that are able to reduce sleep to compete locally and to fly long distances between breeding sites, leading to a population with unrestricted interbreeding and without local adaptation and speciation.</p><p>Nature  1 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20813">doi: 10.1038/nature20813</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/8GAdgazZlu4" width="1" />

            <p>Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization—a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl–B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib—a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis—was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20800">doi: 10.1038/nature20800</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/vAQPhs6sNjs" width="1" />

 Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.

<p>A little humor in the workplace appears broadly beneficial: it can increase <a href="http://www.apple.com">productivity</a> and creativity and helps to <a href="http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/laugh-and-workplace-laughs-with-you.html">build trust</a>. But before you get too carried away attempting to stun your colleagues with your wit, you might want to heed the findings from <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-54537-001/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, which focused on the effect of humour attempts on our personal status. The work shows that while a well-judged gag can cover us in glory, misses can have negative consequences. What’s more, this risky nature partly explains why we hold funny people in esteem.</p>
<p><span id="more-16584"></span></p>
<p>An initial study had a decidedly scatological bent. The researchers Brad Bitterly, Alison Wood Brooks, and Maurice Schweitzer asked participants to make up customer testimonials for a company that specialised in pet waste removal. Afterwards each participant listened to testimonials supposedly made up by other participants and judged the calibre of the person who’d written them. For instance, one testimonial began: “Very professional. After cleaning up the poop, they weren’t even upset when they found out that I don’t have a pet!” Participants gave higher ratings of status, competence and confidence to participants who delivered a funny “faecestimonial”, compared to their straight-faced counterparts.</p>
<p>Next the researchers investigated what happens when jokes fall flat. Nearly 300 participants read about a hypothetical job interview where a candidate responded to a question either with a straight answer or with an attempt at humour. When the humour was successful – the manager laughed – the candidate was perceived as higher status, but there was no advantage when the moment was followed by stony silence. It seems a flopped joke doesn’t help your status, but doesn’t lower it either. But what happens when the humour isn’t just weak, but also inappropriate?</p>
<p>In another study – a rehash of the job interview scenario – a cheeky candidate replied to a question with a tasteless “that’s what she said” sexual innuendo. Candidates that attempted the joke and were met with silence were judged the most harshly, rated as low status and incompetent. Those who won a laugh (suggesting the attempt wasn’t entirely misjudged) were still rated lower than candidates who didn’t make a crass joke. A repeat of the experiment with a different tasteless joke reinforced the finding: inappropriate humour is a poor gambit that leaves you worse off than forgoing the opportunity.</p>
<p>According to Bitterly and his colleagues, the fact that joke-telling harbours risk is partly why it commands our appreciation. To correctly gauge the right humour for your audience and nail the delivery requires competence. Moreover, the mere act of attempting a joke betrays confidence because of the fact that it can easily backfire. Indeed, jokers were always rated as more confident, even when the jokes were misjudged and failed to produce their intended effect. To some extent, this explains why failed jokes (when in good taste) didn’t significantly change status, as they betray low competence but redress this somewhat through showing confidence.</p>
<p>Bitterly’s team suggest that “many individuals may be missing opportunities to project confidence, demonstrate their competence, and increase their status” by making attempts at tasteful humour. But how to avoid backfires? Humour usually involves some break with the expected or permitted, most often a social norm, but also absurdist humour that subverts reality itself, like Mitch Hedberg’s “My fake plants died, because I did not pretend to water them”. According to Bitterly’s group (<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/3/407/">and other humour scholars</a>), the key to successful joke telling is to ensure your audience understands the threat is benign, rather than indicating genuine anti-social or confused thinking. When the joke leads people to wonder if you endorse the sentiment, or that you are providing cover for people that do, then they are liable to think less of you… even if you’ve perfected your comic</p>
<p>– timing.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-015-0580-1">Genomic signatures of domestication on neurogenetic genes in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></a></p>
<p>A considerable body of research exists on the evolution of the species domesticated by humans over the last few thousand years. But what about those species that scientists have domesticated much more recently, such as the classic laboratory model species <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>?</p>
<p>Craig Stanley Jr. and Rob Kulathinal at Temple University conducted the first study of behavioural differences between wild and lab-strains of <em>Drosophila</em>. They confirmed that lab-reared flies are considerably less active than wild-caught flies. Genomic comparisons of five lab strains with the wild-type genome suggests these changes are not just due to accumulations of deleterious mutations caused by inbreeding. Instead, a distinct pattern of genetic changes across the five strains supports the idea that these traits have been selected for. Early geneticists may have unconsciously selected for flies with lower activity by breeding the individuals that were easiest for them to catch and manipulate, creating the distinct domestic phenotype we see today.</p>
<p>Rob Kulathinal discussed the research in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/01/26/the-taming-of-the-fly/">on our blog</a> in January.</p>
<p><strong>Survival of the oldest</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0646-8">Why are some species older than others? A large-scale study of vertebrates</a></p>
<p>Why do some species persist for longer than others? ‘Living fossils’ like the coelacanth and the frilled shark have survived for tens of millions of years, yet many other species arise and become extinct in far shorter periods of time. A team of researchers at the University of Lausanne sought to discover common factors shared by long-lived species.</p>
<p>Comparing 600 vertebrate species, the researchers compared species age with a number of life-history factors, while controlling for evolutionary relationships. Species with varying colored individuals, those that give birth to live young, and/or those that live at low latitudes were the most resilient to past environmental changes.</p>
<p>Aside from satisfying our evolutionary curiosities, this research could also be useful to conservationists. Species which have persisted through long periods of past climatic changes will, presumably, be more resilient to future climatic changes. Conversely then, we can predict that species lacking the life-history factors common to many long-lived species are potentially the most vulnerable to the effects of future climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Hawk vs. goose</strong></p>

<p>The black sparrowhawk has successfully colonised the urban environment of South Africa’s Cape Town in recent years, with around 50 pairs now breeding there. Their new environment has brought challenges however, including a particularly aggressive neighbour: the Egyptian goose. Egyptian geese find black sparrowhawk nests ideal to lay their own eggs in and will often take over occupied nests; at twice their size, and with an aggressive temperament, there is little a sparrowhawk can do to prevent a goose from usurping their nest.</p>
<p>In response, sparrowhawks have developed a new tactic to deal with covetous geese: build a lot of nests. Sparrowhawks in territories that had previously experienced nest usurpation by geese built significantly more nests than pairs with no experience of usurpation. This tactic seems to be successful; sparrowhawks that build multiple nests largely overcome the deficit in reproductive success experienced by other individuals breeding in territories with geese activity that do not build multiple nests.</p>
<p>We discussed this research in more detail <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/05/09/hawk-vs-goose-cope-unpleasant-neighbour/">on our blog</a> in May.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic tug-of-war linked to evolution of gay beetles</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0658-4">Sexually antagonistic selection on genetic variation underlying both male and female same-sex sexual behaviour</a></p>
<p>Same-sex sexual behaviors (SSBs) do not readily conform to classical evolutionary models: what adaptive benefit can such behavior have? SSBs are often explained as perception errors; males mistake other males for females and attempt to mate with them. This is less of a persuasive argument in species, like the seed beetle, where females also engage in SSBs. Instead, researchers at the University of Uppsala presented evidence that SSBs in these beetles reflect an underlying evolutionary tug-of-war between the sexes.</p>
<p>The researchers selectively bred beetle lines that exhibited higher rates of SSBs. Both males and females in these lines showed higher mobility than wild-type beetles. For males this resulted in higher reproductive success, presumably as they could mate with more females. For females though, the opposite was true; higher mobility was linked to lower reproductive success.</p>
<p>This suggests that there is a pleiotropic effect underlying the evolution of SSBs; the same genes linked to SSBs are also linked to increased mobility and so, for males, can be adaptive. Presumably this evolutionary benefit for males outweighs the damage it does to their sisters, who show SSBs without any accompanying adaptive benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Female chimps give out mixed messages</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0691-3">Mixed messages: wild female bonobos show high variability in the timing of ovulation in relation to sexual swelling patterns</a></p>
<p>In many primate species, females signal their willingness to mate through sexual swellings of their genitalia. In most primates these sexual swellings are an honest signal of a female’s ability to conceive, enabling males to focus their reproductive efforts on receptive females. In bonobo chimps however, these signals appear to be rather less honest.</p>
<p>Researchers tracked the timing and duration of sexual swellings in wild bonobo females and, by also collecting urine samples during this time, examined their correlation with the actual time of ovulation. Duration of sexual swellings varied considerably (from 1-31 days) and, moreover, there was no correlation between ovulation and the maximal swelling period.</p>
<p>In bonobos then, female sexual swellings are not an honest signal to males. This may explain why bonobo males do not engage in aggressive guarding of females during their swelling period, as is the case with other primates. In turn, this could be one of the reasons behind bonobo’s famously peaceful society: lies help to keep the peace.</p>
<p>Lead author Pamela Heidi Douglas discussed her research in more detail <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/06/30/female-bonobo-sexualswellings-mixed-messages/">on our blog</a> in June.</p>
<p><strong>Crickets have solid social networks</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0726-9">Wild cricket social networks show stability across generations</a></p>
<p>The study of animal social networks continues to grow, with research across a range of taxa addressing a wealth of different questions. One limitation of these studies is that they generally cannot determine if social network structures persist across multiple generations. If they do not, then evolutionary processes, such as the evolution of cooperation, could not take place; a cooperative strategy that exploits aspects of the social network in one generation might not be successful in the next, preventing it from persisting in the population.</p>
<p>The difficulty of testing cross-generation social network stability partly arises from the species being studied, often long-lived mammals like whales and primates. To follow the social structure of these species through multiple generations would be a considerable challenge. This is why the research group of Tom Tregenza at Exeter University focused on crickets for their study of social network stability.</p>
<p>Do crickets have social networks? Yes, in the sense of networks of social interactions between individuals that either mate with or fight each other. Tracking a population of wild crickets across eight generations, the researchers found that the social networks in any given year were able to predict the structure of networks in other years, regardless of how far apart those years were in time. Thus, it appears that cricket social structures are indeed persistent across generations and that evolutionary processes relying on network structure could take place.</p>
<p>While the researchers caution that their methods may not scale up to larger population sizes, this work was a big step forward for the study of animal social networks.</p>
<p><strong>Teeth, teeth everywhere</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0721-1">Ontogeny reveals function and evolution of the hadrosaurid dinosaur dental battery</a></p>
<p>Hadrosaur dinosaurs, the dominant herbivores of the late Cretaceous period, had arguably the most complex dentition of any vertebrate that has ever existed. Each jaw ramus contained a battery of up to 300 teeth consisting of multiple generations of small, vertically-stacked teeth interlocked with neighbouring teeth. Surprisingly though, the development of these batteries conforms to a simple evolutionary model.</p>
<p>Aaron LeBlanc and colleagues undertook the first comprehensive, tissue-level study of dental ontogeny in hadrosaurids. They made use of modern techniques to create a three-dimensional view of the arrangements of the enamel and dental attachment tissues in unworn teeth in order to understand the development and function of the dental battery.</p>
<p>Their findings show that the complex teeth batteries did not involve the evolution of any unique dental tissues. Instead the novelty of hadrosaur dentition came in how ancestral reptilian dental tissues were utilised in the interactions between individual teeth and between families of teeth; in a way somewhat analogous to how medieval chain mail was constructed.</p>
<p><strong>Male and female cats respond differently to distressed kittens</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0718-9">Female cats, but not males, adjust responsiveness to arousal in the voice of kittens</a></p>
<p>Like many mammals, when separated from their mother kittens begin to cry. Previous research by a team led by Marina Scheumann at Hannover University demonstrated that the auditory content of these messages varies between a ‘low arousal’ state (when a kitten is just spatially separated from its mother) and a ‘high arousal’ state (when a kitten is also manipulated by the researchers). In this new paper, they looked to see if these changes in the kitten distress call are actually detectable by their mothers.</p>
<p>Female cats did indeed modify their response to recordings of kitten cries according to their urgency, responding around 10% faster to high arousal calls. Surprisingly, experience with actually raising kittens did not affect this; virgin female cats responded as quickly as experienced mothers did.</p>
<p>Another surprising finding of the study was that male cats – who play no role in rearing offspring – reacted as quickly as females to cries of kittens in the low arousal state. However, unlike females, male cats did not respond more quickly to urgent, high arousal calls. This implies an inbuilt genetic difference in how the sexes respond to the emotional content of a kitten distress call.</p>
<p><strong>In the blink of an evolutionary eye</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0786-x">Phylogenomic analysis of carangimorph fishes reveals flatfish asymmetry arose in the blink of an evolutionary eye</a></p>
<p>Flatfish might appear to possess one of the more unique evolutionary adaptations, an extreme cranial asymmetry resulting in both eyes being on one side of their head. Yet some recent phylogenetic studies had suggested that this adaptation evolved independently in two groups of flatfish, although other studies supported the traditional view that the cranial asymmetry evolved only once in an ancestor shared by all modern flatfish.</p>
<p>This confusion mainly results from uncertainties in the evolutionary relationships of the wider fish group flatfish belong to, the caringimorpharia. A team of researchers led by Matt Friedman at Oxford University used ultra-conserved DNA elements to produce the most robust phylogeny of the caringimorpharia yet assembled.</p>
<p>This new evolutionary tree supports a single evolutionary origin of the (indeed unique) flatfish cranial asymmetry. It also suggests that the reason for the conflicting results of previous studies was the remarkably quick speed at which this adaptation evolved; just 2.9 million years. Flatfish seem to be remarkable not just for their unique morphology but also for having undergone such drastic morphological changes in nothing more than the blink of an evolutionary eye.</p>

The frog, going under the scientific name <em>Hyla japonica</em>, is certainly found in Japan, but also in other parts of East Asia like Russia, China, and South Korea. Recently however, some have suggested that <em>H. japonica</em> populations in mainland Asia and in Japan should be considered as two or more separate species.<img alt="hyla-japonica" class="alignright wp-image-8311 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Hyla-japonica-184x300.jpg" title="Public Domain" width="184" /></p>
<p>A multi-national team of researchers, including collaborators from Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, South Korea and China, pooled genetic data on <em>H. japonica </em>and related species from across the East-Asian peninsula. This allowed them to determine both the genetic similarities among these disparate populations and to infer how the evolution and distribution of these frogs was affected by past climatic changes and major geological events.</p>
<p>They found that current patterns of diversity were likely triggered by tectonic activities during the Miocene (5-23 million years ago) and by more recent glacial periods, which caused the formation and disappearance of land-bridges between Japan and the main Asian continent. They also found evidence for cryptic speciation within <em>H. japonica</em>, with significant enough genetic diversity between Japanese and mainland populations for the authors to argue they should indeed be considered separate species.</p>
<p>Curiously, due to the arcane rules of taxonomy, if <em>Hyla japonica</em> were to be split into multiple species the name <em>japonica</em> – literally meaning ‘things related to Japan’ – might have to be assigned to the mainland frog population. So the Japanese tree frog might end up not being Japanese after all.</p>

            <img alt="Retail food stores and supermarkets are important environmental settings for promoting healthy food choices." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/supermarket-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>One of the most recurrent New Year’s resolutions is to lose weight. Nevertheless, year after year only very few of us achieve this noble objective despite our good intentions. As a result, obesity and overweight have not been declining. Clearly, this is a complicated subject and many factors can be attributed to why it is not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain it. Earlier, it has been highlighted how obesogenic environments coupled with our human/psychological flaws undermine our plans to maintain a healthy body weight. In a recent <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3985-x">systematic review</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health,</em> we considered one important environmental factor that plays a major role in calories consumed: the food store. We surveyed and then evaluated health interventions aiming to promote healthy food purchase behavior at food stores and among targeted populations. We assessed not only the effectiveness of various strategies, but we also put the methodological quality of the addressed studies to test. Following is a summary of the main findings from our review.</p>
<p><strong>What characterizes effective food store health interventions?</strong></p>
<p>The general finding of our review is the efficacy of in-store/point-of-purchase healthy food interventions, despite some articles with low methodological quality. Furthermore, the effectiveness of food store health interventions depends on several factors including the type and number of intervention components, employed incentive structure for participating store owners as well as targeted population of consumers, stakeholder involvement and approval, community/consumer engagement, and depth of intervention implementation.</p>
<p>Interventions with multiple strategies are to be preferred as they complement each other. In addition, we found that price incentives receive the strongest response in terms of outcome. This holds true for direct price discounts, vouchers for healthy foods, and subsidies of certain nutritious foods. Incentives work not only for consumers, but also for participating food stores. Example of successful incentives for food stores include the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program in the United States, which incentivizes eligible stores to stock certain promoted healthy foods, and a national discount program in South Africa (Vitality HealthyFood program) that targets households who are members of an insurance company and offers them a discount of up to 25% on healthier foods at more than 800 supermarkets throughout the country. Due to their large scale, both these programs create incentives for supermarkets as well as targeted consumer groups to show pro-health behavior. It should be noted that stores could also be brought on board by incentives other than monetary. Some stores may be interested in building their reputation and as such they can be convinced to promote pro-health food stocking strategies as part of their corporate social responsibility.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8363" style="width: 250px;"><img alt="With obesity on the rise, it's important that grocery stores play a role in reversing the epidemic." class="size-full wp-image-8363" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/obesity.jpg" width="240" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">With obesity on the rise, it’s important that grocery stores play a role in reversing the epidemic.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: Sandra Cohen Rose and Colin Rose</div></figure>
<p>Moreover, engaging consumers and creating an interactive environment for them, in addition to posters and shelf labels, seems to be more helpful than mere labels or nutrition information. Examples of successful consumer engagement include cooking demonstrations/taste tests, and interactive education.</p>
<p><strong>What could be improved in the future?</strong></p>
<p>With regards to research quality, we found that, according to the chosen assessment tool, the methodological quality scores of the papers range from the lowest score of 42.9% to the highest score of 92.9%, yielding an average quality score for all papers of 65.0%. A major takeaway from this result is the need for more high quality studies. Unlike other settings, such as studies reporting school-based interventions, the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is limited for food store settings, albeit with encouraging progress recently. Therefore, more high quality studies in the form of RCTs are called for.</p>
<p>Although price interventions have the strongest impact on the outcome of healthful food purchase, we note, however, important observations. It is not trivial to implement price incentives on a large scale and for sustained periods. Therefore, it needs more persuasion than other interventions (such as information campaigns) as someone has to bear costs associated with subsidizing healthier foods (or higher prices for less healthier foods). The difficulty is even more pronounced if their implementation is not cost-neutral, as someone has to finance the difference due to changes in the original prices. In certain cases, storeowners may be convinced that, due to economies of scale, they will not incur losses despite price reductions of healthier foods. In most cases sustained price interventions need political solutions, and as such research should be disseminated in a way that motivates political action.</p>
<p>A related observation when conducting this review is the limited number of studies that use the currently influential concept of nudging which is believed to be a low-cost alternative to other intervention approaches. For example, few studies demonstrate the effect of using shelf space management to promote healthy foods in prime in-store locations. It is particularly interesting as some prime locations like the checkout area are currently used for promoting high calorie foods. Therefore, more experiments with nudging and other innovative intervention methods in grocery settings are needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more focus should be given to both healthy and unhealthy foods and substitution behavior. The majority of current interventions focus on F&amp;V as the promoted healthy food. While these interventions are rightly justified as most people in many countries do not meet F&amp;V dietary guidelines, there is also a need to consider interventions to limit the consumption of less healthy foods, e.g. high energy items such as sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) and salty snacks. If possible, total food store sales should be used to judge the overall effect of the intervention (including substitution effects). Although differences in studies are unavoidable and understandable, adopting some common outcome measures would be useful to enhance comparability of studies. Moreover, food frequency questionnaires used in some studies, if possible, should be supplemented with objective sales data.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings also highlight the challenges involved with in-store healthy food interventions. We cannot stress enough the importance of stakeholder management and the use of correct incentives for these agents, particularly the food stores whose support is critical for any effort in this direction. It is important to show store managers how their stores can benefit from the proposed intervention, and not just present them with how the intervention benefits research or even the target group. Show them what is in it for them.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="A white voodoo doll with five red pins in it" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16577" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/thinkstockphotos-139957598.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>When we feel ostracised, we’re more likely to behave aggressively. Previous research suggests that vengeance on those who we think have wronged us <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/13/what-makes-revenge-sweet/">can be driven by a sense of justice</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/02/03/brain-scans-reveal-revenge-is-sweet-for-men-but-not-women/">may activate neural reward centres</a>. But being ostracised can also lead to generalised aggression, even lashing out at unrelated people, so there seems to be more going on. In new research in <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, David Chester and C. Nathan DeWall tested the idea that social rejection, by making us feel wounded and unwanted, triggers a need to repair our mood by whatever means available, including through the satisfaction of causing harm to those who have made us suffer. They found that aggression can indeed be a viable method of mood repair.</p>
<p><span id="more-16568"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked 156 participants to write an essay on a personal topic, then to swap their essays with other participants to receive feedback on what they’d written. One group of participants received nasty feedback (actually composed by the researchers): “one of the worst essays I have EVER read”. Chester and DeWall measured mood before and after participants were given the chance to express a symbolic form of aggression: sticking pins in a virtual voodoo doll imagined as the person who had given them mean feedback. This act of (un)sympathetic magic did indeed repair mood for the rejected participants, to the point where their mood was indistinguishable from participants who’d received nice feedback.</p>
<p>But just because revenge can boost our mood doesn’t mean that we behave aggressively because we’re seeking that better mood. To investigate motives, the researchers next invited 154 participants to the lab and gave each a pill, telling them it would enhance their thinking for the tests to come. Some of the participants were further told that the pill had a peculiar side-effect: once it kicked in, their mood would become fixed and unchanging (all these claims about the pill were a fiction, it was an inert placebo).</p>
<p>Next, all the participants took part in a computer-based game where they and two other players passed a ball back and forth. Those in the “Rejection condition” experienced a cold shoulder from their two playmates (actually pre-programmed computer responses), receiving only three of the 30 passes, compared to an equal share of passes in the “Accepted condition”.</p>
<p>After the game, participants rated how rejected they felt, then they had the chance to take revenge in a second game against one of their previous playmates. The game was a simple ‘first to the buzzer’ reaction race, but each round the slower player was always punished by a blast of noise through their headphones. When participants were faster, they could adjust the intensity of the noise suffered by their opponent, up to 105 decibels: the volume of a jackhammer or a helicopter hovering at 100 feet.</p>
<p>Most of the time, participants who’d suffered earlier rejection chose to inflict louder sound blasts on their opponent (who’d rejected them earlier). But this wasn’t true of the participants who’d earlier been told that the pill had the side-effect of fixing their mood. In the break between games, these participants were alerted that the drug was by now fully active and their mood would stay as it was for an hour. These participants restricted their sound blasts to the lower levels administered by participants who hadn’t suffered earlier rejection. It wasn’t that the “fixed mood” participants were unaffected by their snubbing: their ratings of rejection were just as high as the other rejected participants. But thanks to the pill, they presumably believed they had no prospect of improving mood, so there would be no point in lashing out.</p>
<p>The results suggest that even seemingly pointless aggression can have a purpose and deliver a desired outcome. Although this research focused on rejection-inspired aggression, it could explain other situations where aggression appears to us to be a plausible route to alleviating our bad mood. Chester and DeWall speculated that “to obtain the positive affect associated with retaliatory aggression, individuals may actively seek out provocation in their daily lives” and they suggested that we consider better alternatives: reflection, meditation and the like. The relief that anger provides is a wretched consolation, and it’s a habit worth kicking.</p>

            <img alt="Spines" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Spines-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Long-term exposure to environmental pollutants is worldwide acknowledged as a major risk factor for health diseases. Indeed, pollution has become a plague. Many clinical studies have focused on the impact of pollution on vital organs such as the lungs and heart. Strong positive correlations between pollutants and cancer (just to make an unfortunate example) are not mysteries anymore. However, new results provide strong evidence that nanoparticles, which can easily find their way into the central nervous system, may lead to severe brain problems. In fact, chronic exposure to harmful metal nanoparticles such as lead, cadmium or iron may impact the normal functioning of our nervous system, eventually leading to cognitive decline as well as to neurodevelopmental dysfunctions.</p>
<p>Lead (Pb) is a well-established environmental pollutant and, because of its high affinity to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Pb can modify basic cellular properties such as cell communication, neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity. Importantly, alteration of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be detrimental for learning and memory processes.</p>
<p>In a recent article published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167401">PLOS ONE</a>, Yang and colleagues report that beta-asarone, a natural compound found in Chinese herbal formulas, such as <em>Kai-Xin-San</em> and <em>Chong-Myung-Tang</em>, was able to ameliorate behavioral and cellular alterations observed in Pb-induced cognitive dysfunctions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>beta-asarone reverses Pb-induced structural and behavioral alterations.</strong></p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnana.2016.00038/full">Golgi-Cox staining technique</a>, the authors report that Pb exposure significantly decreased spine density in the hippocampus, a brain region highly involved in learning and memory functions. Surprisingly, this detrimental effect induced by lead was significantly reduced when rats were treated with beta-asarone. “<em>This result indicated that beta-asarone treatments repaired Pb-induced impairments in spine formation in developmental hippocampus</em>”, says Qian-Qian Yang, the leading author of the study. Dendritic spines arise as small protrusions from the dendritic shaft of various types of neurons and receive inputs from excitatory axons. They contain neurotransmitter receptors, organelles, and signaling systems essential for synaptic function and plasticity.</p>
<p>In order to correlate the results obtained on dendritic synaptogenesis with a possible behavioral phenotype, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task">Morris Water-Maze test</a> was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory in rats. Interestingly, Pb-exposed rats showed a dramatic reduction of spatial memory functions, while beta-asarone treatment was able to retrieve the Pb-induced spatial memory deficits in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether these data suggest that beta-asarone may act as a neuroprotective agent. How that might happen?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>beta-asarone reverses Pb-induced molecular modifications.</strong></p>
<p>Several proteins are involved in the regulation of dendritic spines structure and formation, such as Arc/Arg3.1 and Wnt7a. In addition, such factors are closely related to the activation of the glutamate receptors NMDA-R and AMPA-R. The authors observed that NR2B (a specific subunit of the NMDA receptor) was reduced after Pb exposure in the rat hippocampus, while beta-asarone supplement restored the reduction in a dose-dependent manner. Parallel to that, also the levels of the immediate-early gene Arc/Arg3.1 were found to be restored following beta-asarone treatment. It must be noted that Arc/Arg3.1 is a key molecule to maintain efficient and intact synaptic plasticity, a form of cellular learning.</p>
<p>Another signaling pathway involved in synaptogenesis is the Wnt signaling cascade. This pathway is one of the central morphogenic signaling pathways regulating early neuronal development and Wnt7a preferentially stimulates excitatory dendritic spine formation. “<em>In the present study</em>”, says Dr. Chen, the senior author of the study, “<em>the relative expression of Wnt7a in hippocampal CA1 area of Pb-exposed rats significantly decreased by 43.2%, which is consistent with our previous results, while beta-asarone treatment dose-dependently recovered the decreasing</em>”.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, beta-asarone has been also reported to reverse decreased BDNF and promote hippocampal neurogenesis in chronic unpredictable mild stress exposed rats (Dong H et al., 2014) and to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a critical kinase involved in neurogenesis (Mao J et al., 2015). “<em>These reports together with our results suggest BDNF/Wnt signaling pathway might represent a key target for various neurogenesis agents, including beta-asarone</em>”, concludes Qian-Qian Yang.</p>
<p>Although the study tries to dig into the intimate cellular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective action of beta-asarone, the authors were not able to point to a direct mechanism by which this natural compound may be the key actor for the structural and behavioral effects observed. In agreement with this last point, the authors state that “<em>Although the exact molecular targets of beta-asarone in promoting neurogenesis are still unclear, our study provided preliminary hints for their underlying mechanisms</em>”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>In a world where environmental pollution has become a serious and dramatic health problem, investing in basic research may lead to the discovery of natural agents able to reduce pollutants’ side effects. Obviously, such pharmacological strategies will be completely useless and unfortunate if not paralleled by drastic changes in environmental regulation and policy.<br />
