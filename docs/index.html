<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="54" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/OS-email_Dec.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>This blog is part of our series on the Future of Open Science. Read previous posts <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/">here</a>. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/preregistration-can-bring-science-back-to-its-roots/">last post</a>, we talked about how preregistration can help facilitate a more objective and transparent assessment of science before authors even begin their investigation. In this piece, we explore the components of that investigation that can support reproducibility by making research more easily verifiable: data, code, and protocols.</span></p>
<p><strong>Easily reproducible science removes barriers to advancement</strong></p>
<p>Science is said to be facing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">replication crisis</a>, but increased openness of data, code, and protocols may help turn the tide.</p>
<p>Replication studies <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584?ijkey=b46fa089bb3e108ad507ef6767db0ad0c04eb69a&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha#sec-10">like this one</a> have found that articles which made data, code, and protocols appropriately accessible, led to reproducible results. The availability of open data is also important to researchers when preparing their own work. More than 70% of respondents to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9980783.v2">2019 State of Open Data researcher survey</a> reported that they are likely to reuse open datasets in their future research, and some rely on them to validate their own findings, increase collaboration, and avoid duplication.</p>
<p>Openly sharing data, protocols and code eliminates barriers for future researchers to replicate and build upon a previous study’s findings. Shared research outputs can stimulate new fields of enquiry, and even lead to <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/78307">an increase in the number of papers that research projects produce</a> and are even associated with higher citation rates for the articles they describe.</p>
<p>However, while many studies confirm the efficacy of sharing practices, they also demonstrate large gaps in the accessibility of these outputs, even in journals with strong data sharing policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Promoting increased transparency </strong></p>
<p>The good news is, favorable attitudes toward greater transparency appear to be on the rise. More and more researchers willing to curate and/or share their data while many publishers, like PLOS, have committed to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">data availability policies</a> that require authors to make their data, code, and protocols accessible for their published research and promote more open culture.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from our own community that they are ready and willing to participate in increased transparency. Researchers who met with us at conferences from Neuroscience to ASM Microbe have told us more options for open data and protocols sharing is the biggest change they want to see in Open Science.</p>

<p>So why isn’t sharing already the norm?</p>
<p>Some data sharing concerns are inherent to the research itself: patient records or data affecting vulnerable populations that cannot be shared publicly, privately funded research may encounter intellectual property issues. But <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Survey_of_Wellcome_researchers_and_their_attitudes_to_open_research/4055448/1">researchers indicated</a> that major barriers to sharing data and code are lack of resources (including time, funding, and organization skills) to do so, as well as uncertainty around receiving credit for their work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reproducibility is all of our responsibility</strong></p>
<p>… And that includes institutions and publishers who play a major role in the creation of incentives for researchers to share more of their work. A significant amount of work has gone into obtaining and analyzing the data, designing the study protocol, and testing new code. Not to mention curating and storing each of these pieces for sharing. Researchers should be recognized for the time and energy they’ve put into this work.</p>
<p>External tools like <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a>, <a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean,</a> <a href="http://plos.figshare.com/">figshare</a> and other enable researchers to document, collaborate, and share products of their research – with unique DOIs – as their work progresses. Publishers also play a key role in promoting these tools alongside developing consistent approaches to reporting transparency and providing resources and <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/request-for-comments-on-data-repository-selection-criteria-that-matter/">guidelines</a> that make it easier for authors to share and get credit for their work. But there’s more we can do.</p>
<p>In order to further transparency at every stage of the research process, we’re asking ourselves how we can empower researchers to make their work more open, receive recognition for their contributions, and increase the discoverability of knowledge that we can all benefit from.</p>
<p>Researchers are telling us they want to see a change in how we share science. We want to see that too and we’ll keep looking for ways to make that possible. Check back in with our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/">Future of Open Science </a>series next month where we’ll look at new outputs that increase the transparency of the research process.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/old-woman_hearing_2019_2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Hearing and vision impairment are increasingly common as people age. After the age of 70 years, over two-thirds of people have a significant hearing and/or vision problems. Dementia is also strongly linked with age; more than one third of people over 90 years have dementia. Unfortunately, hearing and vision impairments are under-identified and under-treated in people with dementia. When sensory impairments co-occur with cognitive difficulties, the impact on the individual is magnified: dependency may increase, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/47/4/575/4985483" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cognitive decline may be more rapid</a>, and communication problems are greater. This <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1064748119304415" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increases the risk of social isolation</a> as well of as developing delirium (confusional states) and challenging behaviors (e.g. agitation, aggression). Ultimately, the quality of life for the person with dementia declines, and the cost of care increases. Despite this, the opportunity to address hearing and vision impairment as a cost-effective way to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-psychogeriatrics/article/interventions-for-hearing-and-vision-impairment-to-improve-outcomes-for-people-with-dementia-a-scoping-review/EB0CB8FD9E85FE28687E14868ABA91EB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">improve outcomes</a> for older adults is significant. Ameliorating sensory impairments to improve mental well-being is a key aim of our European Commission-funded Horizon 2020 program ‘<a href="http://www.sense-cog.eu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SENSE-Cog</a>’.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<p>Our journey with SENSE-Cog started in 2016 in the response to the call for proposals under the banner of ‘Mental Wellbeing for Older People.’ Based on this, we gathered 27 investigators from across Europe, representing a range of disciplines, including hearing, vision, and cognitive health, and the fields of epidemiology, health economics, biostatistics, and clinical trial design. Together, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/48/4/580/5272748" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we decided to examine the links</a> among hearing, vision, and cognitive health, with a view to clinical applications. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1336-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new study</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we consulted with people living with dementia (n=18) and their care partners (n=15) in the UK, Cyprus, and France to determine the best approach to improving the lives of people with dementia with co-occurring hearing and vision problems. Several key themes emerged, including: (1) the need to improve our methods of assessment of cognition in people with hearing and vision problems and (2) the possibility of improving quality of life in dementia by improving hearing and vision health.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lack of valid and reliable assessment tools … was a significant unmet need.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Challenges identified</strong></h3>
<p>Our qualitative data revealed three areas of difficulty for persons with dementia (PwD) and their care partners,  illustrated here with quotations.</p>
<p>First, hearing, vision, and cognitive assessments were not appropriately addressed to the complex needs of PwD and sensory comorbidity:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I know what she got it wrong [in the assessment], I knew the ones she can’t do […], you’ve got to draw a diagram, which will be inside a box, and […] I know she can’t do it, she can’t. But I mean that’s it, I got nothing, I got nothing else. Just a score. </em>(Care partner)</p>
<p>Second, PwD commonly experienced challenges in communication and conveying unmet needs and concerns to care partners and professionals, across domains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It [my condition] has taught me to listen to people. If they’re talking to me, you know, really listen to what they say, which I think some, some, I don’t say generalised but some people don’t listen to what you say to them. So if I want to know I’ve got to listen.</em> (PwD)</p>
<p>Third, information about and guidance regarding support for the condition was not adequate in the assessments:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Researcher: <em>so there wasn’t much of an explanation?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Care partner: <em>[…] yes more explanatory, this might have happened because there are different doctors and they are very busy…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Researcher: <em>neither for how to take care…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Care partner: <em>They have to inform us more.</em></p>
<p>From our consultations, it was clear that the lack of valid and reliable assessment tools for assessing cognition in people with sensory impairments and for assessing hearing and vision in people with cognitive impairments was a significant unmet need.</p>
<p>People at risk of or with dementia often do not report hearing and vision impairments. Likewise, people with hearing and vision problems often have difficulty completing cognitive assessment tests, since <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-psychogeriatrics/article/screening-tools-for-the-identification-of-dementia-for-adults-with-agerelated-acquired-hearing-or-vision-impairment-a-scoping-review/26E3D0F85316DA0B64A6C47BC9368F59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most of these tests</a> rely on intact hearing and vision.</p>
<h3><strong>Responding to unmet needs</strong></h3>
<p>We then attempted to address these outstanding needs by (i) developing and validating new cognitive assessments specifically adapted for people with hearing or vision impairment and (ii) developing and evaluating a home-based ‘sensory support intervention’ to improve quality of life and other outcomes for people with dementia.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11499 size-medium alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/eyes_2019-300x300.jpg" width="300" />
<p>The assessment development work centers around alternative forms of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e026246" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">being developed and validated</a> for people with either hearing or vision impairment. The home-based intervention involves assessment of hearing and vision linked to individualized sensory support for people with dementia, delivered by a sensory support worker. The additional support from the therapist helps with uptake, correct use, and maintenance of hearing aids and glasses. The therapist also provides advice on improving the sensory environment in people’s homes; this might involve better lighting, noise reduction, or addressing problems with acoustics. Finally, the therapist also teaches communication skills for care partners and directs the person with dementia to community supports and services, if needed. The intervention was developed with the input of several stakeholders and field-trialed in three countries. It is now being evaluated in a definitive <a href="https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-018-2973-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">randomized controlled clinical</a> trial in five European countries.</p>
<p>Throughout the SENSE-Cog program, the needs and perspectives of patients and their care partners have been central. The design and conduct of all of the work is informed by a network of ‘Research User Groups’ in five European cities, <a href="https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40900-018-0128-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comprising people living with dementia or sensory impairment and their care partner(s)</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>
<p>SENSE-Cog will provide validated cognitive assessments adapted for hearing and vision impairment to improve the reliability of diagnoses. It will also provide an evidence base for sensory-based interventions to improve outcomes for people with dementia and inform clinical practice guidelines for clinicians and care workers in hearing, vision, and cognitive health. In addition, the SENSE-Cog project is creating momentum and interest in the worldwide research and clinical community in the growing field of sensory-cognitive health. Our future work includes translating the sensory support intervention to other settings, including low- and middle-income countries (SENSE-Cog ASIA) and care (nursing) home settings (SENSE-Cog CARE).</p>

<p>When you have a disagreement with your boss, how do you respond? Do you consider that you might be at fault and try to consider the other’s viewpoint? Or do you dig in your heels and demand that other people come around to your way of thinking? In other words, do you make wise, practical decisions, or are you prone to being stubborn and petty in the face of criticism? <span id="more-38762"></span></p>
<p>As I describe in my recent book,<img alt="The Intelligence Trap Cover" class="  wp-image-36610 alignright" data-attachment-id="36610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="The Intelligence Trap Cover" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/the-intelligence-trap-cover.jpg?w=421" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/the-intelligence-trap-cover.jpg?w=194" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/the-intelligence-trap-cover.jpg" data-orig-size="421,650" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/the-intelligence-trap-cover/" height="223" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/the-intelligence-trap-cover.jpg?w=144&amp;h=223" width="144" /> The Intelligence Trap, a whole new field of “<a href="https://evidencebasedwisdom.com/">evidence-</a><a href="https://evidencebasedwisdom.com/">based wisdom</a>” aims to measure these kinds of differences in people’s thinking and <span>behaviour, and to understand the reasons for them. Taking inspiration from </span><span>philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates, these psychologists argue that wise reasoning involves five qualities: intellectual humility (recognising the limits of your knowledge); a recognition of uncertainty about how a situation may unfold; a recognition of others’ perspectives; the use of an outsider’s viewpoint; and the search for compromise. There are now various measures of these ways of thinking, including self-report questionnaires and more involved laboratory experiments. And researchers have begun to study how wise</span><span> reasoning is related to other individual differences: for instance, these measures </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594053/">appear to predict well-being above and beyond other cognitive traits (like IQ)</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Igor Grossmann at the University of Waterloo has been at the forefront of this work, and his latest paper, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ack8n/">available as a preprint at <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>, examines whether people’s level of “rejection sensitivity” might determine some of the individual differences in wisdom. Working with Anna Dorfman and Harrison Oakes, he hypothesised that the threat of rejection could lead some people to become more self-defensive as they strive to protect their own ego, potentially reducing their willingness to accept their mistakes, see others’ viewpoints, and look for compromise — their capacity for wise reasoning, in other words.</p>
<p>To find out if that were true, the trio conducted a series of six experiments that asked a total of 1,617 participants to consider how they would respond to various workplace conflicts, such as excessive criticism from a colleague. After they had thought through their reactions, the participants were asked to rate how much they had engaged in each of the five qualities of wise reasoning (such as intellectual humility) described above.</p>
<p>They were also tested on more general “rejection sensitivity”, using a <a href="http://www.midss.org/content/rejection-sensitivity-rs-adult-questionnaire-rsq">standard questionnaire</a>. Participants were asked to rate how anxious they would feel before inviting family members to an important event, in case they refused to come, and in various other situations.</p>
<p>As Grossmann’s team had hypothesised, the people who were more sensitive to rejection did indeed tend to score lower on all five of the qualities associated with wise reasoning when faced with the conflict: they reacted in a more defensive and closed-minded way, for instance, and were less intellectually humble. Interestingly, this was true even when the researchers controlled for personality traits, including neuroticism and narcissism — the fear of rejection was an independent factor in explaining the differences in wise reasoning. Given the importance of wise reasoning in resolving conflicts, these results also suggest that people who fear rejection may be less likely to find an amicable resolution to these kinds of situations.</p>
<p>When designing the scenarios, the team had also tried to manipulate the power dynamics within the conflict — some participants were told they were a supervisor, for instance, while others were a subordinate. Perhaps a sense of power makes you more ego-centric, the researchers theorised, which would mean you are less wise. However, the participants’ position with the company had little effect on the <em>overall</em> scores of wise reasoning, though it did influence some of the individual qualities. Imagining themselves in a more subordinate position increased people’s intellectual humility, for instance, while the high-flyers were more likely to see the other’s perspective. Your boss may seem aloof and uninterested in your feelings, but perhaps they are more capable of seeing your viewpoint than you think.</p>
<p>Like much of the research on evidence-based wisdom, this new finding gives us plenty of food for thought about our own actions and the dynamics of our relationships. It remains to be seen whether there are ways to overcome our sensitivity to rejection to increase our wisdom in these difficult situations. For those of us who struggle to take knocks to our confidence, old habits die hard.</p>
<p>Grossmann’s previous research suggests it should be possible, though. As <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/24/a-new-trial-of-an-ancient-rhetorical-trick-finds-it-can-make-you-wiser/">I’ve written for <em>Research Digest</em> previously</a>, a technique called “self-distancing”, in which you describe your dilemma in the third person (“David was angry that…”), can help us to become less immersed in the feelings of threat or upset, which allows us to take a slightly more dispassionate attitude — almost as if we are talking through someone else’s problem, rather than our own. You may feel like Elmo or even Donald Trump, but that slight detachment encourages more open-minded and humble thinking, leading to higher scores on the wise reasoning tests.</p>
<p>Future research may suggest other ways of dealing with the fear of rejection, to reduce self-defensive and closed-minded behaviour during conflict. For now, the best approach would be to take a deep breath and try to advise yourself as if you were your best friend.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/12/10/arxivs-accessibility-goals/">arXiv’s Accessibility Goals</a></h4>

<p>The goal of accessibility is to provide access to as many users as possible, including those who use assistive technologies, and is a natural and important extension of arXiv’s core mission.</p>
<p>We have recently posted our <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/accessibility">accessibility statement</a> to the website that defines our thinking and roadmap for achieving an accessible arXiv. We welcome feedback from the community as we move forward on this path.</p>
<p>While we continue to make accessibility updates to the existing legacy codebase, our arXiv NG project will help us achieve a new level of access. It is “born accessible”—built with accessibility in mind from the ground up—and makes use of structural, semantic HTML as the best way to support assistive technologies and beyond.</p>
<p>Accessibility is good business practice in every way. It opens arXiv to a wider number of users, moves us towards semantically resilient code, clarifies content and meaning, not to mention minimizing legal risk. The accessibility statement on the website covers our goals in fuller details, but here are a few of the benefits to the arXiv community as we make progress towards accessibility and inclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>arXiv is free and open to everyone from all over the world. An accessible website demonstrates arXiv’s commitment to open access knowledge.</li>
<li>Accessible design offers clear and direct benefits to arXiv’s extremely diverse and international user base. Accessible design is, by its nature, flexible and allows content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems.</li>
<li>Accessible websites, through their emphasis on core meaning and their rejection of superfluous content, greatly benefit those with a slow internet connection or limited bandwidth.</li>
<li>Moderators and administrators are a critical part of arXiv’s longevity and success. To ensure arXiv is open to the most qualified moderators and administrators the interfaces that they use must be accessible.</li>
<li>Of course, avoiding legal risk is critical to all organizations. Accessibility is not just a great business practice and the right thing to do, it is a legal requirement and a Cornell mandate. But when we shift our thinking from minimum compliance to focus instead on the opportunity and creative challenge of building better experiences for everyone we can create a more sustainable, user friendly platform for the entire community.</li>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Last year we published a list of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/">ten psychology findings that reveal the worst of human nature</a>. Research has shown us to be dogmatic and over-confident, we wrote, with a tendency to look down on minorities and assume that the downtrodden deserve their fate. Even young children take pleasure in the suffering of others, we pointed out.</p>
<p>But that’s only half of the story. Every day, people around the world <span>fight against injustices, </span><span>dedicate time and resources to helping those less fortunate than them, or just perform simple acts of kindness that brighten the lives of those around them. And psychology has as much to say about this brighter side of humanity as it does the darker one. So here we explore some of the research that demonstrates just how kind and compassionate we can be.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-38740"></span></p>
<p><strong>Kids as young as two are surprisingly selfless…</strong></p>
<p>We tend to think of toddlers as selfish creatures — but it seems that even very young children are more prosocial than we give them credit for. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/">In one study</a>, pairs of two-year-olds were given a set of marbles that made a nice sound when put into a box. Children this age are not exactly renowned for sharing — yet the team found that about half the time, the kids divided up the marbles fairly. Only in 19% of trials did one child selfishly take all of the toys for themselves. In a variation of the study, one of the pair started out with three marbles, while the other received just one. Even in this case, the luckier child willingly gave one of their marbles to the less fortunate kid in about a third of trials. And toddlers even seem to enjoy helping others. Two-year-olds <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/10/two-year-olds-seem-to-find-helping-others-as-rewarding-as-helping-themselves/">show positive body language and emotions</a> after doing a task which benefits someone else — in fact, helping others seems just as rewarding to the children as helping themselves.</p>
<p><strong>..and some theories suggest that we are all, in fact, altruistic by nature</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just toddlers: we’re all predisposed to help others, according to some researchers. Even in the presence of strangers who we may never see again, we regularly act for the benefit of the group and punish those who don’t, even if it comes at a personal expense — a behaviour sometimes called “<a href="https://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/strongr.pdf">strong reciprocity</a>”. This could explain why people often co-operate rather than act selfishly in the kinds of tasks psychologists use to study economic behaviour — and why people will even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/07/06/was-altruism-borne-out-of-a-universal-willingness-to-punish/">forgo some of their winnings to punish those who act unfairly</a>. It could even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170320-we-hate-to-admit-it-but-brits-arent-the-best-at-queuing">account for the fact that we love to queue</a> (and shout at those who skip the line).</p>
<p><strong>Our personalities have “light” dimensions — they just haven’t been studied as much as the dark ones</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of papers have been published on the so-called “Dark Triad” of traits: narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, all associated with undesirable behaviours like manipulation, egotism and callousness. But this focus on the undesirable side of our personalities “misrepresents the full capacities of humanity,” according to Scott Barry Kaufmann and colleagues. Earlier this year, the team <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/22/psychopaths-and-narcissists-have-hogged-the-limelight-now-its-time-to-explore-the-saintlier-side-of-human-personality-say-researchers-as-they-announce-a-test-of-the-light-triad-traits/">published a new scale to measure what they call the “Light Triad</a>”, made up of humanism, “Kantianism” (treating people not as a means to an end, but as an end itself), and faith in humanity. The work was exploratory and it’s still early days, but the team found that high scores on the Light Triad traits were associated with a greater quality of life — and overall, people generally scored higher on the Light Triad than the Dark Triad.</p>
<p><strong>When it comes to the environment, children have a profound sense of right and wrong</strong></p>
<p>That’s according to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/16/childrens-moral-judgments-about-environmental-harm/">a 2011 study</a> in which children were presented various scenarios in which a person displayed bad manners, performed some moral transgression like stealing, or made an environmentally harmful action, like damaging a tree. The kids rated harm to the environment as worse than bad manners, and they overwhelmingly gave “biocentric” rather than “anthropocentric” explanations for their ratings: they believed that the environment <em>per se</em> is worthy of respect, not just because it provides sustenance to humans.  Of course, this finding will probably come as no surprise to most of us eight years later, where children are leading a global movement to demand action against climate change.</p>
<p><strong>We place more value on someone else’s physical suffering than our own</strong></p>
<p>We all know about Stanley Milgram’s experiments, in which participants were convinced by an authority figure to administer electric shocks to another person. But not only has the classic interpretation of these studies <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">been questioned</a> — other work has also found that we’re really not that keen for another person to experience physical suffering. In a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/28/a-shocking-result-people-are-more-willing-to-hurt-themselves-than-others-for-profit/">2014 study</a>, researchers gave participants cash rewards for electric shocks, with the opportunity to increase the intensity of the shock for extra money. The twist? Sometimes the participants themselves received the shock, but in other cases a stranger in another room was the victim. Surprisingly, the team found that people were much more willing to give themselves a larger shock for extra money: they needed twice the cash incentive to raise the pain level for the stranger.</p>
<p><strong>“Paying it forward” is a real thing</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it sounds just like the plot of an <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223897/">overly-sentimental, early-2000s film</a>, but it turns out that when we are nice to people, they really do pass on the goodwill to others. Researchers asked a small group of employees to perform simple acts of kindness to their co-workers for four weeks. By the end of the study period, levels of morale and happiness increased amongst those who had been on the receiving end of those acts. But, importantly, these receivers also reported <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/04/small-acts-of-kindness-at-work-benefit-the-giver-the-receiver-and-the-whole-organisation/">that they themselves had begun engaging in more positive behaviours towards others</a>.  “Our study suggests that although everyday prosocial acts may be small, they are not insignificant,” <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2017-24716-001.pdf">the researchers conclude</a>. “The benefits of prosociality do multiply, favoring not only those who give but also those who receive and observe.”</p>
<p><strong>One of our </strong><strong>guiltiest pleasures may be motivated by feelings of empathy and compassion</strong></p>
<p><span>The rise of reality TV might seem like a sure sign of the worst excesses of humanity. The fact that we will spend our free time watching strangers’ relationships fall apart or people having their dreams crushed in front of an audience of millions doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in our species. And yet, </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/24/why-do-we-enjoy-reality-tv-researchers-say-its-more-about-empathy-than-humiliation/">according to a 2016 study</a><span>, our drive to watch reality TV might have altogether more positive origins. Researchers gauged participants’ opinions on reality shows like </span><em>Big Brother </em><span>and </span><em>MasterChef</em><span>, and asked how much they would like to participate in these shows and what they’d think if a family member wanted to take part. The more that people enjoyed watching the shows, the happier they said they’d be for themselves or a loved one to participate. The authors say that the findings suggest people watch reality TV because they empathise with the contestants, not because they like to see people being humiliated — otherwise they would surely be against their loved ones taking part. Perhaps that conclusion should be taken with a pinch of salt, but at the very least the research does imply that our motivations may not always be as unpleasant as we instinctively believe.</span></p>
<p><strong>Although we think we’re more selfish when we’re hungry, we’re actually not</strong></p>
<p>Everyone can relate to the feeling of being “hangry”. But it turns out that even when we haven’t eaten in a while, we actually remain pretty helpful and co-operative towards others. That’s according to a 2019 paper which found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/11/when-were-hungry-we-remain-surprisingly-helpful-and-co-operative/">hungry people were just as likely as those who had recently eaten to contribute money to a shared pot</a>, or agree to participate in a future study. Yet people <em>expected </em>others <span>—</span> and even themselves <span>—</span> to be less co-operative when hungry. The authors say that’s due to the “myth of self-interest”: the mistaken belief that we are all inherently selfish. And while a 2011 study famously found that judges <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.short#sec-1">make fewer favourable rulings as they get increasingly hungry</a>, that finding has also <a href="https://mindhacks.com/2016/12/08/rational-judges-not-extraneous-factors-in-decisions/">since been debunked</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Those of us who have suffered the most show the greatest compassion towards others</strong></p>
<p>Experiencing trauma can be devastating and have a range of negative repercussions. But people who have had more adverse experiences also tend to be more empathetic, according to research from Daniel Lim and David DeStono. The pair has found that those who have been through a greater number of negative experiences like disasters, bereavements and injuries <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/20/people-who-have-experienced-more-adversity-show-more-compassion/">display more empathy and are more willing to give to charity</a>. That seems to be because they <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/23/how-personal-experience-of-adversity-influences-our-feelings-of-compassion-towards-others/">have a stronger belief in their ability to make a difference to others who are suffering</a>. This isn’t to say that adversity is a positive thing <span>—</span> but it does suggest that out of the darkness, something good can sometimes emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, many “classic” studies that seem to reveal the worst of human nature have been challenged </strong></p>
<p>There are a handful of classic social psychology findings that every student learns about <span>—</span> and which, more often than not, tell us something awful about the human condition. But the textbook account of these studies doesn’t always stand up to scrutiny. Take the Stanford Prison Experiment, in which volunteers assigned to the role of prison guards began to abuse those in the role of prisoners. Recently, psychologists have challenged this traditional account: one analysis of recordings from the experiment suggests that the researchers <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/time-change-story">took a much more active role</a> in encouraging the guards to behave in a tough way than they originally claimed, undermining the gloomy conclusion normally drawn from that study. Another example is the bystander effect, which most textbooks will illustrate using the case of Kitty Genovese <span>—</span> except the description of that horrific case that most of us have read <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/23/the-truth-behind-the-story-of-kitty-genovese-and-the-bystander-effect/">is not exactly correct</a>. So while the bystander effect is undoubtedly real, and although there are plenty of terrible examples throughout history of people using their position of authority to cause harm, it’s also clear that human nature is far more nuanced than we learn about in PSYC101.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of widely available smart phones, there has been uncertainty surrounding possible association between smart phone use and declining mental health among children and young people (CYP). This follows a 68% increase in rates of self harm in the UK since 2011 when smart phones first became widely available. Recent studies has provided conflicting results with some studies finding significant interactions where others may not, suggesting it may not be smartphone use or screen time that is associated with poor mental health but rather smartphone addiction. This is characterized by a new term: Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) which encompasses several concepts of behavioral addiction:  tolerance, withdrawal (dysphoria when the battery dies), preoccupation, neglect of other activities, subjective loss of control and continued use despite evidence of harm.</p>
<p>By conducting a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis the authors of this paper found some harmful interactions between mental health and smartphone use. It showed the prevalence of PSU to range between 10%-30%, with females in the 17-19 year-old age group most likely to exhibit symptoms of PSU. The study also identified a significant association between PSU and depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress and poor education attainment as well as identifying similarities between PSU and substance abuse disorders. Like alcohol, smartphone use is socially acceptable and widely available posing a different and arguably more pressing public health problem than substances of abuse. With 1 in 4 CYP demonstrating problematic smartphone use and patterns of behavioral addiction that mirror substance use addiction, urgent policy reform is required to prevent the possible long term and widespread impact on current and future generations’ mental health and well-being.</p>

<p>With an increasing number of tests available for the diagnosis of women with symptomatic ovarian cancer and 200,000 women per year being diagnosed with ovarian cancer globally, it has become increasingly important to understand and evaluate differences in policy and guidance for testing strategy across systems. By conducting a systematic review the authors of this manuscript identified that most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until the onset of clinical symptoms. Their results also identified significant differences between international guidelines for identification of ovarian cancer. Since differences persist not only in the clinical features suggested to trigger the suspicion of ovarian cancer but also in the initial examinations and investigations these guidelines advocate.</p>
<p>Significantly positive correlations are already known to exist between the national survival and primary care practitioner’s readiness to investigate or refer women presenting with possible symptoms of ovarian cancer, variation in international guidelines could be influential in the timeliness of ovarian cancer diagnosis and survival. The study found significant correlation between the complexity of tests performed and the specialty of the clinician performing the initial assessment, suggesting that in countries such as the UK, Ireland, Australia and Scandinavia, where general practitioners (GPs) act as gatekeepers to more specialist referrals, testing available for ovarian cancer was much more limited, potentially increasing the time to diagnosis. The authors conclude that documents and guidelines, especially related to healthcare system (national or private) are suggested to significantly influence the likelihood of timely ovarian cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p>Child maltreatment has been linked to lower health, education, and income later in life, and is associated with increased engagement in delinquent or criminal behaviors. With 9 out of every 1000 children in the United States experiencing maltreatment resulting in their involvement in the child welfare system, this study aimed to explore trajectories of behavior from adolescence into early adulthood and how maltreatment during childhood may act as a predictor. Using a sample of more than 10,000 U.S. adolescents, the authors aimed to test the effect of maltreatment on behavior and the associations between them with special focus on the effect of physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse, exploitation or neglect perpetrated by individuals in positions of power.</p>
<p>The study finds that individuals exposed to maltreatment had higher levels of violent offending, progressively increasing with continued exposure to maltreatment frequency. It also found a positive relationship between individuals identifying as LGBQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Queer) and the level of non-violent offending frequency as compared with non-LGBQ individuals. In addition, the study identified that the relationship between maltreatment and predicted non-violent offending is stronger for males compared to females, with teenage maltreated males having the greatest predicted non-violent offense frequency. The authors conclude that better understanding the differences in experiences between males and females may be particularly important as increasing numbers of females become engaged in the juvenile justice system. Further, they state an increased need to teach males, in particular, how understanding and identifying stress responses could decrease the need for externalizing responses.</p>

With developmental stages of the oocyte from stem cell to egg depending on vast cellular processes and bio-electrical properties, the authors of this paper aimed to study the connections between electrochemical signals and the patterns of basal microfilaments and microtubules. By selectively inhibiting several ion-transport mechanisms, the authors were able to determine that stage-specific bioelectrical patterns are in fact simulated by changes of pHi- and V<sub>mem</sub>-gradients that occur within the cell naturally. These changes in intracellular gradients and thus in bioelectrical properties also result in observed cytoskeletal changes during differential states of the follicle-cell epithelium (FCE), instrumental in the regulation and organisation of cell and tissue architecture.</p>

<p>With 3.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies resulting from mental-health related causes, mental disorders are one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity for women during the perinatal period, with 101 women dying by suicide in the UK and Ireland between 2009 and 2013 alone. This represents one in seven of all maternal deaths. However, whilst maternal suicide is the highest cause of mortality in perinatal women, it is not the only mental-health related outcome, with perinatal depression, anxiety and psychosis being other serious effects of mental disorders during the perinatal period. Previous studies have found that women with a history of severe mental illness commonly experienced a relapse or deterioration of their condition during the perinatal period, with 43% of women experiencing a relapse of a major depressive disorder and up to 50% experiencing a major bipolar disorder. Other examples of commonly observed relapses include psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders. These are also further confounded by substance misuse or intimate partner violence. Declining mental health of pregnant women has also been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, finding strong associations between mothers with depression and the lower preterm birth of the neonate. Similar interactions are observed in women with maternal schizophrenia where the child is more likely to be born with congenital abnormalities, identifying serious impacts of maternal mental health on pregnancy outcomes. This study highlighted that out of a cohort of over 140,000 pregnancies, one fifth reported a history of a mental disorder, of which 80% of women had no access to specialist perinatal mental health services. This paper emphasizes the critical importance of routine enquiry regarding the psychiatric history of women presenting to maternal services.</p>

<p>We’re all familiar with the concept that with ageing comes a gradual loss of bone density and reduced size and strength of our muscles.</p>
<p>Some loss of muscle and bone density is normal, but losing too much leads to frailty and increased risk of injury.</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the idea that ageing is associated with cognitive decline – a gradual loss of memory and slowed ‘thinking’ and reaction times.</p>
<p>But here’s an idea that may be new: <em>cognitive decline and muscle loss may be linked.</em></p>
<p>Understanding how muscle loss and cognition influence one another is crucial towards pinpointing the mechanisms that underlie both dementia and the muscle-wasting disease of ageing, sarcopenia.</p>
<h2>The muscle-wasting disease ‘sarcopenia’ may have its origins in the brain</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/the-muscle-wasting-condition-sarcopenia-is-now-a-recognised-disease-but-we-can-all-protect-ourselves-119458">Sarcopenia</a> is to our muscles what osteoporosis is to our bones.</p>
<p>Sarcopenia is defined by a continuous loss of skeletal muscle mass that interferes with an individual’s ability to function independently. It is the reason why older adults lose their strength as they age, and it appears to accelerate after the fourth decade of life in both men and women.</p>
<p>Muscle loss is often attributed to hormonal and inflammatory processes. However, preclinical evidence links neuron death to muscle loss. As the specific neurons that innervated muscle — so-called motor neurons — degenerate, muscle, in turn, loses strength and mobility.</p>
<p>University of Otago neuroscientist <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/bhrc/staff/otago040510.html">Associated Professor Phil Sheard</a>, is interested in sarcopenia (and he also happens to be Sarah’s Honours thesis advisor … “Hi Phil”!!).</p>
<p>Sheard is investigating the role of the neuromuscular junction because progressive withdrawal of the motor nerve from the muscle fibre seems to be a conspicuous feature of elderly muscle. He’s curious about the ‘chicken and egg’ scenario — is motor nerve withdrawal a cause of muscle fibre death, or a consequence of it.</p>
<p>Sheard says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Muscle does nothing on its own, all muscle function is initiated by the central nervous system.</p>
<p>If the drive from the CNS is taken away, then muscle falls immediately silent.</p></blockquote>
<p>If our ageing neurons are one reason why we losing strength with age, how can we preserve both?</p>
<h2>Exercise mediates neuronal death in ageing models of sarcopenia</h2>
<p>The elixir is exercise!</p>
<p>Sheard and colleagues have published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5964256/">research</a> which shows that exercise prevents age-related motor neuron death and age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass.</p>
<blockquote><p>Endurance exercise delays the onset or slows the progress of these degenerative processes, thereby keeping motoneurons alive and preserving neuromuscular integrity and innervation status.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sheard explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>What does exercise mean for a neuron? For upper and lower motor neurons, exercise is just a change in the number and pattern of action potentials.</p></blockquote>
<p>‘Action potential’ is another term to describe neural electrical activity or neural ‘firing’. Thus, a case can be made for stimulating neurons to continually fire action potentials in order to stave off their eventual death. Sheard has demonstrated that exercise slows the degeneration of neurons in the peripheral nervous system, and believes it holds true for neurons within the brain too.</p>
<p>Engaging neurons in the CNS (brain) can be done with both exercise <em>and</em> other forms of sensory stimulation including enriched intellectual and social experiences. We have evidence of the anti-ageing effect of social and intellectual engagement on the brain (<a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/9-lessons-from-people-whove-lived-the-longest/">see here</a>). And conversely, we have evidence withdrawal from social activities is a hallmark of worsening cognitive outcomes.</p>
<p>In once sense, our CNS has many tools to remain healthy and efficient well into our later years.</p>
<h2>Neurons <em>and</em> muscles benefit from being active</h2>
<p>It is important to clarify that while muscle loss and cognitive decline are related. The exact mechanism linking the two requires further study. For example, individuals in impeccable physical health can still develop dementia.</p>
<p>Questions Sheard and others are asking include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the processes that lead to both sarcopenia and dementia inherently related at a cellular, multifactorial level?</li>
<li>Does sarcopenia increase risk for cognitive decline by virtue of CNS decay alone, or the fact that as frail individuals lose independence, they withdraw from social and intellectual engagement?</li>
<li>Are the methods for keeping neurons healthy throughout our bodies pretty much the same, or is there more to it?</li>
</ul>
<p>With these closing questions, I encourage you to look into the vast conversation surrounding neuroscience and physiological outcomes. Our muscles are important, and keeping them healthy may mean saving our brains.</p>
<p>As Sheard sums up,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Muscles and neurons are benefited by the same thing: being active.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to disagree as emerging evidence suggests stimulation, exercise and engagement improve outcomes throughout our entire nervous system.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS is part of a group of affiliate journals that have agreed to consider submissions with transferred reviews from Review Commons without restarting the review process. All of our journals within scope — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Pathogens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — now welcome submissions reviewed at Review Commons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors can submit preprints or unpublished manuscripts to Review Commons for expert peer review coordinated by </span><a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/faq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional editors at EMBO Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Authors can then decide the best home for this Refereed Preprint which contains the manuscript, the reviewers’ reports plus any author responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By engaging with preprints and related initiatives like Review Commons, PLOS empowers authors to share more of their work, earlier, so that they can start receiving feedback, credit and citations sooner, in addition to making the scholarly communication process run more efficiently. Researchers in the life sciences are clearly engaged with preprints, and we believe engaging with initiatives like Review Commons puts researchers first, and helps make research more fair, equitable, and accessible for more people. By submitting to Review Commons, authors will spend less time re-submitting their papers to multiple journals and can make informed decisions more quickly, without having to start the process from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also support the notion that with Review Commons, reviewers can focus on reviewing for science and not on specific journal “fit” — we talk more about this idea in our post from November,  </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/why-engage-with-preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Engage With Preprints?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

A group of researchers from Iran, Italy and the UK have retracted two meta-analyses on supplements and high blood pressure after making what a statistics expert calls a common error. Both papers were originally published in the Journal of Human Hypertension. Here’s the retraction notice for “Elevated blood pressure reduction after α-lipoic acid supplementation: a … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/09/authors-retract-two-studies-on-high-blood-pressure-and-supplements-after-realizing-theyd-made-a-common-error/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Authors retract two studies on high blood pressure and supplements after realizing they’d made a common error</span></a>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">It’s been known for centuries that we experience all kinds of optical illusions, and in the past few decades, researchers have shown that some animals, including monkeys, pigeons, and dogs, do too. Now the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-15632-001"><span class="Hyperlink0">first ever study of this kind </span></a>in reptiles has found that even the bearded dragon falls for an optical illusion that we humans succumb to.</span></p>
<p>Perceptual illusions — subjective interpretations of physical information — are interesting to psychologists because they reveal important insights into how we construct our representations of the world. This new work, published in the <em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em>, provides evidence that at least one reptile can be counted among the animals don’t simply passively process retinal signals, but actively interpret visual data, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-38729"></span></p>
<p>Maria Santacà, at the University of Padova and colleagues used the Delboeuf illusion in their new study. Look at the image below: both black circles are identical. But most people will under-estimate the size of the one with a bigger white background and over-estimate the size of the other, leading them to report that former looks smaller.</p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Recent studies of capuchin monkeys showed that they make the same mistake. And in tests in which the black circles were replaced with identical portions of food, so too did chimpanzees: when given a choice, they generally opted for the circular food portion with less space around it. (In fact, people also over-estimate the size of food portions presented on small plates.)</span></p>
<p>Reptiles, as the authors write, “were long considered to be sluggish and unintelligent; however, when tested under appropriate experimental conditions, they exhibit an impressive array of cognitive abilities.” For example, recent work has shown that both bearded dragons and red-footed tortoises can perceive similarities between 2D pictures and the objects that they represent.</p>
<p>For the new study, Santacà and her colleagues tested a total of 12 bearded dragons and eight red-footed tortoises, all housed at the University of Lincoln. In place of black circles, they used circles of jelly food beloved by the two species: mango jelly for the tortoises and a kale, cucumber and mint jelly for the bearded dragons. The researchers used two different sizes of white circle, in place of plates. One bigger “plate” was 4.92 cm across, the other 1.82cm.</p>
<p>First they tested whether, when given a choice between a bigger jelly circle and a smaller one, the animals would actually go for the larger one. The bearded dragons did; the tortoises were a lot more inconsistent. Then they repeatedly presented the animals with a 1.5 cm diameter circle of jelly centred on a big or a small circle. The bearded dragons consistently went for the jelly placed on the smaller “plate”. This certainly implies that they mistakenly perceived this jelly to be bigger than the other.</p>
<p>The tortoises, on the other hand, didn’t show any preference for the smaller plate. But in the first stage of testing, they’d been just as likely to make a beeline for the smaller food portion as the larger one, so it’s impossible to draw any conclusions as to whether or not they might perceive the illusion too, the researchers write. (Why would the tortoises not go for the bigger portion? Perhaps because both portion sizes were already quite big, the authors suggest, also noting that none of the animals were food-deprived during the study.)</p>
<p>However, this study does provide the first evidence that a reptile species perceives a visual illusion. “This indicates that, like some mammals, birds and fish, some reptiles can interpret and alter visual input related to object size,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/com0000204">commentary</a> on the work, Todd Freeberg at the University of Tennessee writes: “This exciting comparative research raises the possibility of visual perceptual mechanisms that may be fairly widespread in animals.”</p>

<h2>Where we need help</h2>
<p>There's always lots to do. Here's a short list of where we need help:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>including new software: <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues">https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues</a>,</li>
<li>using and testing the software, to ensure that it works correctly: just
download the ISO or install tools and use them, and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/">file bugs if (when,
rather) you find them</a>,</li>
<li>keeping our <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">documentation</a> up to date:
documentation is paramount, so we need to keep it up to date,</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't list the skills that these tasks need, because we're not simply looking
for people who have them already. We are looking for people who'd like to
promote Open Science, and we will help them learn the skills.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Why do children so readily believe in someone as ridiculous as Father Christmas — a man who flies around the world climbing down millions of chimneys, all in one night?</strong> It’s not that children are simply gullible beings, <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-children-really-believe-in-santa-the-surprising-psychology-behind-tradition-126783">argues Rohan Kapitany</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>: studies have shown that they can actually be pretty sceptical. Instead, it’s the detailed and committed actions modelled by adults — putting up trees, leaving out biscuits, hanging stockings — that seem to suggest to kids that <em>of course </em>this jolly red gift-giver must be real.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="more-38714"></span></p>
<p><strong>We take for granted our ability to constantly perceive where our bodies are in space. </strong>But what happens when people lack this sense of “proprioception”? At <em>Vox</em>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/22/20920762/proprioception-sixth-sense">Brian Resnick explores</a> how a small number of patients are helping scientists to unravel the mysteries of our sixth sense.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>As we move away from cash — paying for purchases with cards and, increasingly, our smartphones — how does our buying behaviour change?</strong> At <em>BBC Future</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191204-does-e-money-make-you-spend-more">Lu-Hai Liang examines the research</a> into the psychology of spending.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>We reported this week <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/02/our-ability-to-recognise-dogs-emotions-is-shaped-by-our-cultural-upbringing/">on a study</a> showing that culture influences our ability to recognise dog emotions. Now researchers have examined human recognition of cat moods — and found that most of us do pretty miserably.</strong> While cats do express emotion in their faces, we’re just not that good at reading them, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/11/30/cats-do-have-facial-expressions-you-probably-cant-read-them/">reports Karin Brulliard</a> for the <em>Washington Post</em> <strong>—</strong> unless you’re in the small minority the researchers call “cat whisperers”.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Meanwhile, another study has found that dogs seem to understand that a word is the same even when it’s spoken by different speakers with different accents. </strong>Previously, humans were the only animal known to spontaneously filter out differences in voices in order to recognise the underlying word, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/12/dogs-hear-words-same-way-we-do?utm_campaign=NewsfromScience&amp;utm_source=JHubbard&amp;utm_medium=Twitter">writes Virginia Morell at <em>Science</em></a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Finally, a neuroimaging study has identified brain areas that are more active when we have nightmares, </strong><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/nightmares-may-be-good-for-you/">reports Russell Deeks at <em>Science Focus</em></a><strong>.</strong> When sleeping participants felt fear during their dreams, they showed more activity in two areas involved in threat response, the insula and cingulate cortex. But that’s not all: in a second study, awake participants who had reported experiencing more nightmares during the week showed <em>dampened</em> insula and amygdala activity while viewing distressing images. This supports the theory that nightmares may act as a kind of “training” that helps us prepare for real-life threatening situations, the researchers say.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/TT-87uCl-t4/">Celebrating 6 Months of Published Peer Review at PLOS</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="70" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/800-manu-with-PPRH_320x690.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently passed our six-month anniversary of published peer review options at PLOS!!! Already you can read more than 800 PLOS articles accompanied by their complete peer review history — and that number is growing everyday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate this huge step towards transparency – and to be transparent about our own findings – we want to share what we’ve learned from this process so far. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Author Response</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between May 22 when we launched this program and November 22, we received 1,536 manuscripts which were eligible for the published peer review history option (authors needed to have submitted their manuscript after May 22 and been accepted for publication). During that time, the average author opt-in rate across all PLOS journals reached 40%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wave of support for revealing the expert assessment behind their work has been even higher on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Medicine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where opt-in rates during the first six months were all above 50% (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is now up to 72%!) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we look more closely at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–which represents so many diverse disciplines and researcher needs–areas with the highest opt-in rates include Public Health (56%), Neuroscience (40%), Ecology (50%), and Psychology (43%).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My own research is concerned with research metrics and analytics and more specifically the development of a research field… to my knowledge, sharing the entire review history is still relatively rare. I hope more researchers as authors and reviewers will adopt the practice to contribute to the transparency of scholarly communication and open science in general. </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>Chaomei Chen, <em>PLOS ONE</em> Author, </b><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223994">Visualizing a field of research: A methodology of systematic scientometric reviews</a></em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just the first six months. We’re excited to see what the next year brings as more authors become familiar with the option to publish their reviews, and the community of readers who rely on PLOS find value in more and more expert opinions freely available to read, cite, and share. </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Veronique Kiermer, PLOS Publisher and Executive Editor </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Has transparent review affected reviewer behavior?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One question posed by our community is how published peer review would impact reviewer activity. Knowing their comments could be made public, would it become more difficult for editors to find reviewers? Would it take longer to return review comments to the authors? So far, we haven’t seen significant changes in either reviewer acceptance of invitations or timing to submit their comments. Of course, our data is still preliminary, and noisy, as many other factors contribute to the reviewer experience, but we expect to learn more as we go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, we hope published peer review will demonstrate benefits to reviewers as well. Making review comments public as a citable object helps elevate the status of reviewer contributions and demystify the assessment process. When reviewers choose to sign their reviews, they can make the review process even more transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the PLOS articles which have been published with review history so far, 55% also include 1 or more signed reviews. Combined with tools like ORCID for reviewers, signed and published peer review provides more opportunities for reviewers to publicly receive recognition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for their work.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signed peer review provides a clear avenue for journals to recognise and support their peer reviewers…As peer review is crucial to the integrity of the scientific endeavour, formally crediting peer reviewers and working with research institutions and funding agencies to ensure that time spent on peer review is valued, will ensure researchers are able to devote their time to this important enterprise. </span></p></blockquote>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Changing the way we see peer review</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe true transparency of the research process is the best way to make science more open to researchers and readers of every career stage, demographic and discipline. By opening the peer review process, we can provide more context for research evaluation and educate future generations of researchers.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This publication in <em>PLOS ONE</em> was my first paper that underwent the peer review process, and initially I was unsure on how the peer review process worked… I hope that by publishing our peer review process, we can help demystify the entire process for fellow early career researchers in addition to shedding light on what reviewers may be looking for as they review papers.  </span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, we’re also experimenting with other forms of transparent review by enabling </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community comments on preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be used in the peer review process and streamlining </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">journal agnostic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, we hope our learnings and the feedback from our community will encourage more researchers and publishers to engage in transparent review, transforming the way we read and evaluate scientific literature. Stay tuned for more updates along the way!</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/12/05/arxiv-machine-learning-classification-guide/">arXiv Machine Learning Classification Guide</a></h4>

<p>We are excited to see the adoption of arXiv in the rapidly growing field of machine learning. Given the interdisciplinary nature of machine learning, it is becoming a challenge for our volunteer moderators to keep up with verifying the appropriate categories for machine learning applications.</p>
<p>When submitting to arXiv, authors suggest which arXiv category they think is most appropriate. This classification determines which category the paper will be announced, and thus, the audience. Our moderators review the appropriateness of classifications in our moderation process, and misclassified papers require additional work for our volunteer moderators to rectify. This means that authors may see that their paper is delayed for announcement and publication. To help avoid this delay, we encourage you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy">review the arXiv categories</a> as you prepare your submission.</p>
<p>Our machine learning (category: cs.LG) moderators are seeing spikes of 250 submissions (new papers, cross lists, and replacements) per day that need attention, and we expect it to continue to rise.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/11/arXiv_cs_machine_learning_over_time_2019.png"><img alt="monthly count of cs.LG submissions to arXiv 2017 to 2019" class="alignnone wp-image-534 size-full" height="500" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/11/arXiv_cs_machine_learning_over_time_2019.png" width="622" /></a></p>
<p>In the future we plan to use machine learning to wrangle classification during the submission process rather than the downstream moderation process. When authors go to submit papers to arXiv, we will be leveraging classifier software developed by Paul Ginsparg to suggest categories to authors. This is part of the arXiv Next Generation submission system that we plan to beta test in 2020.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are asking our authors to review the <a href="https://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses">subject classes for Computer Science</a> and consider the best fit before submitting. We also have suggestions for some of the most common decisions authors weigh.</p>
<p><strong>Is my subject most appropriate for machine learning in Computer Science (cs.LG) or in Statistics (stat.ML)? </strong></p>
<p>These two categories are very similar with overlap. Often it depends on the authors’ home field of study. In general reinforcement learning papers should have cs.LG as primary — unless they are more appropriate in math.OC (optimization and control), econ.GN (general economics), or eess.SY(systems and control). Papers categorized with cs.LG as primary are automatically cross-listed as stat.ML and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>I am applying machine learning in a field. Which category should I choose?</strong></p>
<p>If the primary domain of the application is available as another category in arXiv and readers of that category would be the main audience, that application category should be primary. Examples include applications to computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), speech recognition (eess.AS), information retrieval (cs.IR; includes document classification, recommender systems, table extraction and recognition, and topic modeling), crowdsourcing (cs.HC), community detection and modeling (cs.SI), education, health and fairness (cs.CY), visualization (cs.GR, and, if evaluated using human studies, cs.HC), traffic management (cs.SY or cs.AI), knowledge graphs and ontologies (cs.AI), stenography (cs.MM), novel sensing techniques (cs.ET), quantitative finance, quantitative biology, physics and astrophysics.</p>
<p><strong>What about within neural network architectures?</strong></p>
<p>Papers discussing the foundations of neural network architectures (activation functions, spiking neurons, etc.) should list cs.NE as primary, as should papers applying biologically-inspired optimization techniques such as evolutionary methods.</p>
<p><strong>What about machine learning applied to signal types, like sound and images?</strong></p>
<p>Papers working with the properties of specific signal types (e.g., sound, EEG, hyperspectral, ultrasound) should consider cs.SD (sound, including music), eess.IV (images and video), or eess.SP (signal processing) as primary. Papers studying images of the real world should consider cs.CV as primary, whereas papers about other image-like signals (fMRI, X-rays, ultrasound, retinal, etc.) usually fit better in eess.IV. Papers that use machine learning techniques to solve specific processing tasks should consider the topic where other approaches for those processing tasks are typically published, for example eess.IV for compression or cs.CV for segmentation, independently of the type of images that are processed. Papers that use computer vision or machine learning methods to attack specific domain applications (for example, detecting diseases in medical images) should be submitted to topics that deal with that application, with cs.CV as a secondary topic. A good rule of thumb for identifying a primary topic is to ask which single community is the most important set of readers.</p>
<p><strong>What about computers assisting human learning?</strong></p>
<p>cs.CY is a better fit for papers studying human learning such as computer-aided instruction. cs.LG is appropriate as a secondary category if machine learning techniques are applied to human learning.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/supermarket-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nutrition claims (such as “low in fat” or “sugar free”) on food packaging may lead people to increase their consumption of those products and their overall energy intake. When unhealthy products are allowed to carry these claims it may contribute to unhealthy diets and obesity. Policy makers should therefore consider restricting the use of nutrition claims on packaged foods as part of broader efforts to improve population diets.</p>
<p><strong>What are nutrition claims?</strong></p>
<p>Nutrition claims are statements on product packaging that suggest or imply that a food has particular nutritional properties, typically in relation to the content of fat, sugar, vitamins or minerals. They can be distinguished from health claims (such as “calcium helps build strong bones”) that describe properties of a food product or food component in relation to health or disease.</p>
<p>The use of nutrition and health claims varies between countries, with several jurisdictions such as Australia, New Zealand, the European Union (EU), Canada, and the United States regulating their use.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition labeling can influence dietary choices </strong></p>
<p>As part of efforts to improve population diets and address high levels of overweight and obesity, the provision of nutrition information (e.g., through nutrition labels and nutrition claims) on food packages has increasingly become an important policy option.</p>
<p>There has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573335" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extensive research</a> on the influence of nutrition labels. This has shown that nutrition labe<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11484" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/nutrition-300x200.jpg" width="300" />ling can be effective in empowering consumers to choose healthier products. However, the specific role of nutrition and health claims in the prevention of overweight and obesity has not previously been clearly delineated.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7622-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent review</a> set out to look specifically at the impact of nutrition claims relating to fat, sugar, and energy content on various aspects of food choices to understand how they contribute to efforts to prevent overweight and obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of nutrition claims relating to fat, sugar, and energy content on food choices</strong></p>
<p>Our review found eleven relevant studies. Almost all of the studies were assessed as ‘low quality’, due to the nature of the experimental designs and the analysis methods used.</p>
<p>Three studies explored the influence of nutrition claims on perceived healthiness of products. All of these studies found that nutrition claims on products led consumers to perceive those products as healthier. A further two studies assessed the influence of nutrition claims on ‘tastiness’. These studies found that people expected products with claims to be less tasty, even though they could not always notice the difference in taste.</p>
<p>Two studies focused on perceived appropriate portion size and energy content of products with claims. These studies found that people perceived products with claims to be lower in calories. People also believed that an appropriate portion size for these products was substantially higher than for products without claims.</p>
<p>Three studies examined the influence of nutrition claims on purchase intentions. One study found people were more likely to want to try products carrying ‘low fat’ claims. However, other studies found that this influence varied by product category, with claims of reduced fat on chips lowering participants’ intention to buy, and claims of reduced sugar on breakfast cereal having no effect.</p>
<p>Five studies looked at the influence of nutrition claims on food consumption. All of these studies found that ‘low fat’ claims were likely to lead people to consume more of the product with the claim. Importantly, none of these studies measured the impact of claims on consumption beyond the immediate choice at hand, and so there is no available evidence of how overall daily energy intake might be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of the results</strong></p>
<p>Policy makers around the world are currently <a href="https://www.who.int/end-childhood-obesity/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">considering a range</a> of initiatives to improve population diets and address obesity. This review provides evidence to suggest that nutrition claims related to fat, sugar and energy content may lead to overconsumption of foods and subsequent higher energy intakes. Policy makers should therefore consider options to limit potential negative influences of nutrition claims.</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of nutrition claims to boost sales of unhealthy foods warrants closer scrutiny.</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, regulation of nutrition claims varies across countries. In the EU, there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/ln_claims_refit_survey_health-claims-nutrient-profiles.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">considerations of plans</a> to incorporate specific criteria to restrict the use of nutrition claims on particular products. In <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017C01048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Australia</a>, health claims are restricted on products that do not meet criteria for healthiness; however, there are no restrictions on the types of products that can use nutrition claims.</p>
<p>While food companies use nutrition claims as marketing opportunities, some food companies voluntarily restrict the use of nutrition claims on their products. For example, Coles, an Australian supermarket chain, has a<a href="https://aa4ed193-10bb-4e34-8c1c-65e97daef1a8.filesusr.com/ugd/2e3337_f3dc17c247b04421b324928304933e5d.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> policy</a> to only allow nutrition claims on their own-brand products that meet certain criteria for healthiness. As <a href="https://sdgcompass.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more attention</a> is focused on the social impact of companies, the use of nutrition claims to boost sales of unhealthy foods warrants closer scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11480 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/Viswanathan_Shankar-038-200x300.jpg" width="200" /></strong><strong>Please tell us about yourself and your research interests</strong></p>
<p>I am a trained biostatistician with experience over two-decades in both methodological and public health research. My research interest includes developing new statistical methods to analyze further questions arising from medicine or public health. Specifically, I focus on survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis and missing data, and some design issues for my methods. The applied (epidemiological or public health) research interest is quite varied. Currently, I am working on studies related to the field of chronic disease epidemiology, injury epidemiology, and global public health.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to become a biostatistician? </strong></p>
<p>I always enjoyed mathematics and majored in statistics in my undergraduate program. While I was exploring to do a graduate study, I stumbled upon the Biostatistics program. The synergy of mathematics and its application in medicine and public health made it attractive and exciting. The thought of playing a small role in changing public health towards betterment led me to become a biostatistician.</p>
<p><strong>Are you working on a particular study or project at the moment? </strong></p>
<p>I am currently involved in multiple clinical and public health studies. Still, one that is close to my heart is examining the role of inflicted traumatic brain injuries in children and its implication towards their neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p><strong>How do biostatistics contribute to our understanding of public health issues?</strong></p>
<p>Biostatistics is a decision science, besides being a study of variation. Biostatistics has long played a significant role in public health in terms of identifying health issues among the population through efficient study design and optimal study size, assessing their extent and the association with exposures, prioritizing intervention or prevention strategies. Biostatistics has also played a vital role in policy advocacy, its implementation, and quality assurance processes in addition to evaluating all the above tasks. Biostatistics contribute to these processes by applying existing statistical procedures or by developing new methods to address research questions and test unique hypotheses. Biostatistics is an evolving discipline which with the current explosion of big data, would not only provide more insights but also contribute towards finding solutions for public health issues.</p>

<p>We love a puzzle here at <em>Research Digest</em> — so here’s a couple from a recent paper in <em>Cognition. </em>See whether you can unscramble the anagrams in the following sentences (read on for the answers!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Cocos Islands are part of <strong><em>idnionsea</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>eeebyoshn</em></strong> kill more people worldwide each year than all poisonous snakes combined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you successfully solved the anagrams, you may have experienced an “Aha!” or “Eureka” moment: a flash of insight where the solution suddenly becomes clear, perhaps after you have spent a while completely stumped. Usually when we experience these moments we have indeed arrived at the correct answer — they don’t tend to occur as much when we’ve stumbled upon an incorrect solution. And in fact, researchers have suggested that we even use Aha! moments as a quick way to judge the veracity of a solution or idea — they provide a kind of gut feeling which tells us that <span>what</span><span> </span><span>has just popped into our mind is probably correct.</span></p>
<p>But relying on these experiences to gauge the truth of an idea can sometimes backfire, according to the authors of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719302963?dgcid=rss_sd_all">the new paper</a>. The team found that experiencing sudden moments of insight when deciphering a statement can make people more likely to believe that it is true — even when it isn’t.</p>
<p><span id="more-38700"></span></p>
<p>Ruben Laukkonen at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and colleagues gave participants 26 statements containing anagrams, such as those above. The participants had 20 seconds to try and solve the anagrams; if they didn’t solve them in this time then they were shown the answer. They then had to indicate whether they had experienced an Aha! moment while working out the anagram, and to judge how true the statement was. Only half of the propositions were, in fact, true (yes, <strong>honeybees</strong> do kill more people than snakes), while the other half were false (no, the Cocos Islands are not part of <strong>Indonesia</strong> – they’re an Australian territory).</p>
<p>When participants successfully solved the anagram — on about 60% of trials — they rated the statements as more true than when they failed to figure it out. This effect held regardless of whether the statement was actually true or false.</p>
<p>On 39% of trials, participants also experienced that satisfying Aha! moment. And in these cases, participants were <em>even more</em> inclined to believe the statement, giving higher ratings of truth compared to those trials where they had correctly solved the anagram but hadn’t experienced that sudden insight.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that people tended to misinterpret the Aha! moment they got from solving the anagram as an indication that the statement itself was true. “People…may turn to their Aha! experiences as a shortcut in place of a lengthy and effortful review of the evidence,” the researchers write. Of course, this tendency to overgeneralise based on our feelings of insight can be a problem: it can make us more likely to incorrectly believe that that false information is true.</p>
<p>And the results also imply that that people who want to actively mislead or persuade us could hijack this phenomenon. “Presentations, news articles, advertising, and other media, may seek to exploit experiences of insight as a tool of persuasion,” the team <span>writes</span><span>. Perhaps this is already happening: think, for example, about the clever ads you often see inside buses and Tube trains</span><span> — the ones that contain little riddles or take a moment to “get”. It remains to be seen whether there are any particular strategies that could help us avoid falling prey to this “dark side” of Aha! moments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NISO recently hosted a two day </span><a href="https://www.niso.org/events/2019/11/open-access-role-and-impact-preprint-servers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seminar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Washington DC entitled “Open Access: the Role and Impact of Preprint Servers,” representing stakeholders across #scholcomm discussing the perceived value, purpose, and implementation of preprint servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a novice to preprints generally (and the nuances of genesis, value proposition, and current implementations specifically), I attended to “bone up” on all things preprints and because of a preview I received a week earlier. At the Charleston Conference Hyde Park </span><a href="https://against-the-grain.com/2019/11/hyde-park-debate-preprint-servers-have-improved-the-scholarly-communication-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Oya Rieger of Itaka S+R and Kent Anderson of Caldera Publishing solutions debated whether preprints have improved the scholarly communication system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oya’s position on the benefits of fast, early communication of results, prior to peer-review, encapsulated </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the “pro” arguments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m familiar with re: preprints. Kent’s comments were new to me and when stripped of some of the agent provocateur language — “preprints disrespect peer-review” — raised many valuable points to evaluate when considering the role of preprints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, don’t get me wrong, I ultimately come down on the side of PLOS with respect to our commitment to preprints (see an extensive </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/why-engage-with-preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on our </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/10/trends-in-preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> re: current preprint </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); however, I do think the discussion at NISO merits deeper consideration (and for the full live tweet thread, see #NISOAccess19)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So! </span><b>Do the benefits outweigh the concerns?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various communities have demonstrated over decades that preprints are valuable, useful, and relatively “safe” in terms of exposing the broader public to research that is not peer-reviewed. As the opening keynote to the seminar, Kent Anderson made some interesting distinctions. First, he’s not anti-preprint (although his twitter feed sometimes conveys the contrary), he’s anti-preprint </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">server</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (that is, the online platforms that disseminate preprints without taking responsibility for the quality of that content and potential downstream effects of making it discoverable). For the extended unpacking, view the #NISOAccess19 hashtag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument is an interesting one: In a current information dissemination climate rife with alternative facts/misinformation and dominated by algorithms that encourage outrage (where anger = clicks = revenue), research findings — peer reviewed or not — that feed this ecosystem risk spreading like wildfire. And with closed media bubbles reinforcing belief systems held by groups, indifferent to facts, unverified, unvalidated scientific claims can be consciously manipulated to further political, social, economic, national security, etc agendas. At the very least they generate clicks, at the very worst they can instantiate beliefs that jeopardize, for example, public health.</span></p>
<p><b>Dog ageing: the perils of news reporting findings on preprint servers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I certainly see this more and more. As an guilty-as-charged trashy news junkie, I stumble upon the infamous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Mail </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from time to time and they are continually publishing click baity articles. The most recent one I’ve seen is about dogs ageing quite differently that we have generally assumed. The research was featured in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telegraph </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is probably how it found its way to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DM.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DM </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">article certainly doesn’t link to the bioRxiv.org paper (</span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/829192v2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and only mentions in passing that it’s not peer reviewed. </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/22/dog-years-myth-puppies-middle-aged-time-two-new-study-suggests/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telegraph</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions it as the closing line to the article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When was the last time you got to the final sentence of an online article? Much less a clicky-baity one? (Note, it took me almost 10 minutes to get from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DM</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article to the bioRxiv article and none of the news outlets linked directly to it, just to bioRxiv.org. I had to search within the platform myself)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, non-peer-reviewed, dog age-ing research seems fairly harmless and mildly amusing. If it turns out, dogs don’t age like this, no one will die. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once you get into research about vaccines, climate change, and politics, the cost/benefit calculus starts to change.</span></p>
<p><b>What happens when reputable outlets do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The famous case of the cell phones = brain cancer study still lingers. (I’m choosing to link to an article </span><a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/cancer-controversies/mobile-phones-wifi-and-power-lines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debunking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it rather than the original paper in biorXiv, which is still available.) Reputable outlets like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mother Jones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published the findings and now most reliable sources have to preface their reminders that there’s no real evidence for this with extensive explanations of why people think there is. </span><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Cancer Society </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has to explain how cell phones work, and the </span><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Cancer Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spends so much time explaining what radiofrequency radiation is that you might miss the section where they state that there’s no evidence to back these concerns.</span></p>
<p><b>What about when the far right does it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case of the far-right populist party, Vox, in Spain is an interesting and cautionary one. Social scientists across Spain have been raising the alarm over the Vox party’s use of research to justify their racist, xenophobic, and nationalist positions. Currently over 3000 spanish researchers have signed a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_nCqvSQ6_q-Acdv4-7sD8LH8igl8gzDFX7ckj3LB53o7XWw/viewform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hold Vox accountable for their misrepresentation of scientific research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They state in their petition:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, VOX’s strategy amounts to nothing else than a facetious resort to using (allegedly scientific) data in order to pursue an ideological agenda impregnated by extreme nationalism, intolerance, racism and xenophobia. It is an agenda that </span><b>misuses, derides, and ultimately mocks the work of thousands of social scientists, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the same time as it undermines the foundations of our polity through lies and fabrications. (emphasis mine)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example of misrepresentation of social science research comes in their misrepresentation of a recent study done by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicos (CIS) on the Spanish public’s attitudes toward immigration. According to the Spanish newspaper, </span><a href="https://elpais.com/politica/2019/10/29/actualidad/1572371208_909716.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Pais</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Para sostener sus argumentos, el partido de Santiago Abascal se apoya en el CIS publicado este martes, según el cual “el 15,6% de los encuestados considera la inmigración como un problema para España”, mientras que el cambio climático “solo interesa al 1,5% de los españoles”. En realidad, cuando el CIS pregunta a los encuestados “cuál es el principal problema que existe actualmente en España”, el 10.7% cita la inmigración entre los tres primeros y solo el 2,3% menciona los problemas medioambientales; lo que les sitúa en el 8º y en el 18º puesto, respectivamente, entre las preocupaciones de los españoles.“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To support their arguments, Vox used data from a recent CIS survey claiming, “15.6% of respondents consider immigration a problem for Spain while only 1.5% care about climate change. In reality, CIS asked respondents, “What is the principal problem that exists right now for Spain,” and 10.7% mention immigration in their top 3 problems while only 2.3% mention environmental issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual CIS study can be found </span><a href="http://www.cis.es/cis/opencm/EN/1_encuestas/estudios/ver.jsp?estudio=14473&amp;cuestionario=17452&amp;muestra=24447"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What does this have to do with preprints?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well that’s the question. If misinformation coupled with systems primed to spread it is the primary concern of those, like Kent, who are worried about research that’s not peer-reviewed entering the mainstream, isn’t this already a problem? Peer-review isn’t the mechanism that stops malign actors for misrepresenting — or entirely fabricating — the “facts” they want to promote. (if InfoWars hasn’t taught us this, then nothing has).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Vox party manipulates research findings to further its messaging, it’s simply misrepresenting how respondents answered surveys. Peer-review isn’t preventing this kind of manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, at the NISO event, numerous speakers representing publishers, funders, preprints providers, and libraries focused on how the benefits outweigh those concerns. This fantastic </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400415/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a 2017 paper on the benefits of preprints for Early Career Researchers (ECRs) illustrates what the various NISO speakers were identifying. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/2019-12-04-09_15_19-PubMed-Central-Fig-1_-PLoS-Biol.-2019-Feb-172_-e3000151.-Published-online-20.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8931" height="893" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/2019-12-04-09_15_19-PubMed-Central-Fig-1_-PLoS-Biol.-2019-Feb-172_-e3000151.-Published-online-20.png" width="1403" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The NISO event further underscored these benefits. Whether it was the managing director of SSRN explaining their goal in creating SSRN — “We wanted to recreate the hallway conversations” — or the individual twitter feedback I got from ECRs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">during</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the seminar — “I’ve had lots of great feedback on preprints that have substantially improved the manuscripts,” it’s clear that the communities building preprints see their value.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/First-Tweet.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8932" height="417" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/First-Tweet.png" width="607" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Second-Tweet.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8933" height="419" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Second-Tweet.png" width="606" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NISO speaker Thomas Narock, Assistant Professor in Integrative Data Analytics at Goucher College, noted that successful preprint servers come from communities that value them. They can’t be successful independent of a community driving them. As Angela Cochran put it on Twitter: it’s not a “if you build it, they (the community) will come” situation. Communities have to drive it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the ones that drive it, clearly value it. Jessica Polka, Executive Director at ASAPBio (currently a PLOS collaborator re: preprints), closed out the NISO event by underscoring these benefits in a presentation that speaks for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gzxJFO_LdjYzket7uvZ8F8BahiLzt2eDqhpGQZTl8ww/edit#slide=id.g631818ff32_0_353"><span style="font-weight: 400;">itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Slides 8-10 really speak to how ASAPBio has seen engagement with preprints evolve and what authors want out of them. It’s this kind of feedback that is really driving PLOS’ own approach to preprint and open peer-review collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall takeaway from the second day of seminars was thoughtfully synthesized by Jessica — let’s not get lost in the naval gazing on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a preprint is. Rather, we should focus our efforts to generate a clear “vocabulary for the full suite of </span><b>peer review and</b> <b>screening checks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can be applied to any version of an article in the publishing continuum.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the justified concern about the dissemination of research findings that aren’t peer-reviewed can be mitigated by using the checks and taxonomies appropriate to the field, clearing indicating the moderation strategies used by that community/server, and effective version monitoring so readers understand how the version they’re reading fits into a wider scheme community feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With organizations like NISO, ASAPBio, and PLOS modeling these kinds of standards and behaviors, the benefits of preprints seem to far outweigh the costs (notwithstanding the serious question of the financial sustainability of preprints, which I haven’t addressed at all here but is a serious hurdle to their long term viability as a vehicle for dissemination — but more on that another time).</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/611062140/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to address the enigmas of everyday life</a></h4>

<p>Here are some hard questions: Is the value of human life absolute? Should we conform to the prevalent values? What do we owe our country? Is justice indispensable? How should we respond to evil? Is it right to forgive bad actions? Is shame good? Should we be true to who we are? Do good intentions justify bad actions? Are moral evaluations overriding?</p><p>The questions are hard because each has reasonable but conflicting answers. When circumstances force us to face them, we are ambivalent. We realize that there are compelling reasons for both of the conflicting answers. This is not an abstract problem, but a predicament we encounter when we have to make difficult decisions whose consequences affect how we live, our relationships, and our attitude to the society in which we live.</p><p>I consider these questions from a point of view that is practical, not theoretical; particular, not general; personal, not impersonal; and above all concrete, not abstract. The questions are asked and answered from the point of view of actual people who face actual predicaments whose resolution has implications for the rest of their lives. There are reasonable answers, but they depend on the evaluation of the relative importance of the reasons for and against the conflicting answers. Such evaluations must take into account the character, attitudes, experiences, and the possibilities and limits of the social context of those who face the questions. They vary, and that is why reasonable answers to hard questions must be personal, not theoretical, and be based on comparisons between the conflicting answers given by two people for whom a hard question has arisen in their context.</p><p>Some examples of such comparisons are between a Japanese kamikaze pilot who gave up his life for his country and an American draftee who refused to serve his country; between a young girl who endured and survived the horrors she had to endure when she was forced into daily prostitution and humiliation that lasted for more than a year, and a priest who struggled with trying to reconcile his faith with his knowledge of what was inflicted on the girl; between how a communist commander of one of the Gulags thought about the inmates’ hard labor in subzero temperature, on starvation diet, and the brink of death caused by the terrible conditions he imposed on them, and a high-ranking religious SS officer who knew about the exterminations and did what he could to save lives; between the contrary responses of two women one of whom accepted her society’s standards and felt shame because she was shamed by them, while the other defiantly refused to feel shame even though she was shamed by her society’s standards; between a man who valued social harmony more than justice and a woman who gave up her life for the sake of justice; and between an honorable soldier who killed himself when circumstances made it impossible for him to remain true to himself and a young man who was deliberately false to himself by rejecting the past that made him who he was.</p><p>These comparisons reconstruct the predicaments faced by the protagonists, trace the reasons that have led them to arrive at the difficult life-changing answer each gave, and enable us to learn from them as we struggle with hard questions as they arise in our own lives. In discussing them, I rely on the resources of anthropology, history, literature, politics, and religion. They make concrete the predicaments of people who had to face hard questions and how they answered them, some more and others less reasonably. The practical, particular, personal, concrete, and comparative nature of these examples exemplifies an approach to ethics that is an alternative to the theoretical, general, impersonal, and abstract approach that characterizes the mainstream of contemporary ethical thought. I attempt to show that ethics can be done in a way that reasonably and concretely addresses the vital concerns of reflective people.</p><p>Featured image credit: “concrete” by Valentin Lacoste.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Telling white lies to children can be somewhat par for the course when you’re a parent: “I’ve got Santa on the phone and he says he’s not coming unless you go to bed now,” is particularly useful during the festive season, for example.</p>
<p>It can seem like nothing: just another tool to improve your child’s behaviour. But don’t get too attached to the technique — telling too many white lies to your children may have more far-reaching consequences than you might have hoped, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002209651830540X?via%3Dihub">according to a new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Child Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-38682"></span></p>
<p>To examine the impact of parental lying, Peipei Setoh from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and colleagues gave 379 Singaporean adults four online questionnaires. First, in the “parenting by lying” questionnaire, participants were asked to recall whether or not their parents had told them various lies during childhood. This 16-item test covers four categories of lies: lies about food, lies about leaving or staying (e.g. “if you don’t come with me now I’ll leave you here”), lies about misbehaviour and lies about spending money.</p>
<p>Next, the participants filled in the “lying to parents” questionnaire, indicating how frequently they themselves now lie to their parents as adults. Three categories were examined: lies concerning “activities and actions” they had taken part in, such as the details of relationships or friendships, “prosocial lies”, in which they had lied to benefit others, and exaggerations about events.</p>
<p>Finally, they took part in a longer questionnaire, which included questions on psychological and social dysfunctions such as problems with thought, attention, aggression, and rule-breaking. They also completed the Levenson self-report psychopathy test, which examines psychopathic traits such as selfishness and impulsivity.</p>
<p>The results suggested that those whose parents had lied more were now more likely to lie to their own parents — by being lied to, in other words, it seemed they had started to believe that being dishonest was morally acceptable. Parental dishonesty may also have eroded trust, the team suggests: by being lied to, children stop trusting their parents and would therefore be less likely to feel obligated to tell them the truth. Participants who were lied to more frequently in childhood were also more likely to have higher levels of maladjustment as adults, particularly when it came to “externalising” problems like aggression.</p>
<p>There are, however, questions about whether the causal inference is as straightforward as it seems. If parents are constantly lying to their children, for example, there may potentially be other underlying relational issues contributing to problems in adolescence and adulthood. Yes, misleading children might not help their development, but there may also be deeper problems that are responsible for their difficulties with attention or behaviour. Participants were also being asked to recall childhood experiences, of which they may have limited memory; subsequent family rifts, deaths, or estrangements may also have impacted their view.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, next time you think about telling what you see as a harmless white lie to keep your child quiet or get them into bed, think again. It may save you some time — but, in the long run, it’s probably not worth it.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002209651830540X?via%3Dihub">Parenting by lying in childhood is associated with negative developmental outcomes in adulthood</a></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/k450dEVuq7A/">Your Research Makes a Difference</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/s/plos-one-2015-most-impactful"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and <a href="https://collections.plos.org/biotop10"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showcased some of the most impactful research published from 2015 – 18 in two new collections. Looking at this body of work, we’re reminded of how science builds the foundation for our understanding of the world around us. Medical research influences public health and professional practice, earth sciences inform how we understand and react to the changing climate, and the list goes on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each new discovery has a ripple effect on the future of research and society itself. How we measure that effect, and all the factors that contribute to it is understandably complicated. Knowing how best to tell the story of your impact can help ensure recognition for your work.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tracking digital footprints through article-level-metrics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citations help us understand and track how a particular research article has helped other researchers build off of existing data and theories to continue investigation in the field. But citations take time, and habits differ among disciplines making. Counting citations alone won’t always capture the way an article has affected new research or policies and professional practice beyond the sphere of academia. To do that, we need to take a broader view and more holistic approach to understanding research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more and more research activity happening through online sources, it’s possible to track the conversation in different ways. In addition to citations, </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article-level-metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help authors keep track of different channels of influence specific to a particular article. Rather than relying on a single number, authors can share a more comprehensive story of their impact that captures the nuance of how other audiences engage with research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fields of high interdisciplinarity and broad public impact, social media mentions capture the conversation. Views and downloads, particularly in areas with a need for immediate information (eg disease outbreak, climate change) also provide a sampling of a work’s broad reach. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Connecting to a broad audience: How you tell your story matters</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Access makes it possible for work to reach a global audience, immediately and without barriers or paywalls. That means your research has the potential to be read by everyone, not just the scientific community. If you want to reach a broader audience, engage more people, and boost the visibility of your work; how you tell your research story matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media coverage is one way for authors to boost the impact of their work and also form a key connection to readers, researchers and policymakers. The partnership between science and journalism is an important means of helping a broader audience understand and sift through the science that is happening every day so that it’s teachings can begin to be used in everyday practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the opportunity to connect with media partners before or after your work publishes – do it! But you can also give more context to your work through your own channels. PLOS provides tips for promoting your own work through your institutional network, social media channels, </span><a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/SpreadTheWord.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Track the effect your work has through <a href="http://almreports.plos.org/">your article-level-metrics</a>, or just take a moment to join a conversation about how research can inspire people. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line: your research makes a difference. When you engage in the conversation, you have the opportunity to add even more context and reach new audiences. If you need extra motivation, just take a look at what our authors and editors had to say about the featured work on <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2019/11/20/celebrating-years-of-impactful-research-and-broad-reach-on-plos-one/">EveryONE</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2019/11/20/celebrating-years-of-impactful-research-on-plos-biology/">Biologue</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">For a “rich” country, by global standards, the UK has an awful lot of people who are not. Fourteen million people — one fifth of the population — live in poverty. Of these, four million are more than 50% below the poverty line, and 1.5 million are classed as destitute, unable to afford even basic life essentials. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">For children who grow up in poverty, there are impacts that go way beyond the fact of material shortages. “Children experience poverty as an environment that is damaging to their mental, physical, emotional and spiritual development,” notes UNICEF. Clearly, there’s a critical role for psychological research in this area, first in revealing just what poverty does to children and adults — but also in developing strategies to ameliorate those impacts.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-38671"></span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The psychological effects on children of growing up poor do make for grim reading. A <span class="Hyperlink0">2009 study </span>published in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</em>, of 9- and 10-year-olds who differed only in their socioeconomic status, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18752394">found striking differences in activity in the prefrontal cortex</a>, which is critical for complex cognition. The PFC response of many of the poor children in response to various tests resembled that of some stroke victims. “Kids from lower socioeconomic levels show brain physiology patterns similar to someone who actually had had damage in the frontal lobe as an adult,” commented lead researcher, Robert Knight, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The kinds of deficits that the team observed could cause problems with self-regulation and behavioural difficulties (both of which have been documented among poorer children), as well as difficulties with reasoning. “This is a wake-up call,” Knight went on. “It’s not just that these kids are poor and more likely to have health problems, but they might actually not be getting full brain development from the stressful and relatively impoverished environment associated with lower socioeconomic status: fewer books, less reading, fewer games, fewer visits to museums.”</span></p>
<p>Since then, plenty of other studies have found that poverty harms children’s brains. In 2014, experiments led by Michele Tine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4263265/">revealed clear deficits in both verbal and visuospatial memory</a> among poor children. A year later, a paper published in <em>JAMA Paediatrics </em><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2381542">documented “irregular brain development” in low income children,</a> and tied these lags in the development of the frontal and temporal lobes to substantially lower scores on maths and reading tests. The development of the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, was particularly influenced by the stresses experienced by these children, the team found.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">These impacts can be long-lasting. <span class="Hyperlink0">A longitudinal study</span>, published by Gary Evans in <em>PNAS</em> in 2016, found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/52/14949">adults who were poor as children showed memory deficits</a> and experienced greater psychological distress. In 2019, meanwhile, <span class="Hyperlink0">a long-term study</span> of nearly 4,000 families in Canada, led by Paul Hastings, reported that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/predicting-psychosisspectrum-diagnoses-in-adulthood-from-social-behaviors-and-neighborhood-contexts-in-childhood/F3DD6323B8F2319875BF4B1F3DF8A352">growing up in a poor urban neighbourhood is associated with a doubling in the risk of developing a psychosis-spectrum disorder</a> by middle adulthood.</span></p>
<p>These studies paint a very bleak picture of the effects of poverty. But not all poor children are affected in the same way <span lang="EN-US">—</span> not every impoverished child in the prefrontal cortex functioning study showed deficits, for example. This suggested that there are also protective factors. Further research in this area suggests that overall stress levels and also the behaviour of the people close the child can make a big difference.</p>
<p>Something as simple as planting more trees in schools in disadvantaged areas might help, according to research by a team at the University of Illinois, published in 2018. Ming Kuo and her colleagues quantified the level of tree and grass cover in the schoolyards of 318 elementary schools (in which 87 per cent of kids overall fell into a low family income category) and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01669/full">found a correlation with scores in both maths and reading</a>: the greater the number of trees, the better the results. Based partly on other work finding a link between the abundance of trees and academic performance outside a low-income setting, Kuo thinks there is a meaningful link between the two. “It’s not a surprise to anyone that if you don’t provide air conditioning or heating in a school then maybe the kids aren’t going to do as well. But this is the first time we’ve begun to suspect that the lack of landscaping, such as trees, may help explain, in part, their poorer test scores,” she says.</p>
<p>A British study published the same year supported these conclusions. This study, of 4,758 11-year-olds living in urban areas of England, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12243">found that children who lived in greener neighbourhoods performed better on tests of spatial working memory</a> (an effect that held for both deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods). “Our findings suggest a positive role of greenspace in cognitive functioning,” commented researcher Eirini Flouri at University College London. What might this role be? Perhaps because <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2016.1196155">it’s restful for the brain,</a> and restores the ability to concentrate.</p>
<p>Interventions that focus on the families of kids growing up in poverty should also help. The team that observed the PFC deficits thinks that in theory they could be prevented, or eliminated. Earlier work has shown that children in poor families hear about 30 million fewer words by the time they they are four than children from middle-class families. Just talking more to kids can boost prefrontal cortex performance, the team notes <span lang="EN-US">—</span> so, they say, changing the developmental outcomes that they observed might involve something as simple as emphasising to all parents the importance of talking to their kids.</p>
<p>Children raised in low socioeconomic status families also tend to go on to have relatively high rates of chronic illness in adulthood <span lang="EN-US">—</span> but again, this isn’t inevitable. A nurturing, attentive and emotionally-supportive mother <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22123777">can buffer the impacts of poverty on physical health</a>, finds a 2011 study led by G.E. Miller and published in <em>Psychological Science.</em></p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/18/why-is-poverty-associated-with-mental-health-problems-for-some-people-but-not-others/">other work</a>, from the University of Liverpool’s Sophie Wickham in 2014, suggesting that a person’s <em>perceptions</em> of their levels of stress, trust and social support mediate the impact of poverty on rates of depression and paranoia. This highlights a potential role for the broader community in mitigating the effects of poverty on individuals within that community. The research, conducted in two areas of Birmingham, suggested that community resilience to hardships, like joblessness and low income, can be enhanced, and that this primarily relies on relationships “not just between members of the community, but also between organisations, specifically between the voluntary sector, the local economy and the public sector.”</p>
<p>Of course, the self-evident way to tackle the negative psychological impacts of poverty is to tackle poverty itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7244">Relaxing financial strains can make a real difference</a>, according to research published in <em>PNAS</em> last year. This work on low income people who were categorised as being “chronically indebted” found that a one-off debt relief programme (funded by a charity) eased the participants’ anxiety, and improved their cognitive functioning, allowing them to make better financial decisions three months later. Thinking and worrying about un-payable debts is so mentally demanding that it contributes to the poverty trap, the researchers argued. “Our study shows that because debt impairs psychological functioning and decision-making, it would be extremely challenging for even the motivated and talented to escape poverty,” commented Ong Qiyan at the National University of Singapore. “Instead, the poor must either have exceptional qualities or be exceptionally lucky to get out of poverty. It is hard to be poor, harder than we thought.”</p>
<p>People who are not poor and have debts simply do not experience the same mental drain, the team comments. “The findings in this study opens a pragmatic case for designing good debt relief programmes for low income households,” Ong argues. Even if debt can’t be written off, streamlining people’s debts, so that mentally they are easier to manage, could help, the team writes.</p>
<p>In 2015, the UK government committed to achieving, by 2030, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which include, at number one, “no poverty”, with “zero hunger” at number two.  However, in 2019, the House of Commons’ Environmental Audit Committee issued a report finding that <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news-parliament-2017/sustainable-development-goals-government-response-published-17-19/">food insecurity is “significant and growing” </a>in the UK, with levels among the worst in Europe, especially for children. One in ten households in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have “low or very low food security” with a further 10% classed as “marginally food secure”. Food bank use is up <span lang="EN-US">—</span> between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the Trussell Trust distributed 1.6 million emergency three-day food supplies to people across the UK, a 19% increase on the previous year,  and more than half a million of these went to children.</p>
<p>These are desperate statistics. Providing more greenspace around schools in deprived areas and providing support programmes for low SES mothers, for example, may work to ameliorate the effects of poverty on children. But for a child whose family can’t afford to <em>feed </em>them, it’s hard not to wonder what difference such measures could really make. One third of the way into the UK’s 15-year timeframe for meeting the UN SDGs of No Poverty and No Hunger, we have an extraordinarily long way to go.</p>

<p>Dr. Annie Angers is in the Département de sciences biologiques at the Université de Montréal</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p>
<p>A: I am a professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Montréal, Canada. I teach molecular and cell biology at all levels. My lab focuses on receptor internalization and inter-organelle trafficking in different cell types.</p>
<p>Q: How many years have you been an editor on PLOS ONE?</p>
<p>A: About two years.</p>
<p>Q: Why is PLOS ONE important to you and the community</p>
<p>A: The publishing criteria. Publishing good science and well-designed experiments in a wide variety of field makes PlosOne a very attractive journal.</p>
<p>Q: What is your area of study and why is it important?</p>
<p>A: I study mostly cellular physiology, focusing on inter organelle exchanges. I think this area is important because it is opening all kinds of new findings and challenges some of our current views of the cell. We are also expanding our work to non-model organisms that reveal that nature diversity is not only present at the species levels, but also at the cellular and molecular levels.</p>
<p>Q: What first drew you into the field?</p>
<p>A: I was first attracted to the field by the findings that internalized receptors continued to signal and had access to a whole new range of effector molecules once at the endosomes. Since then, our molecular toolbox has expanded tremendously, and there is no limit to the questions that we can expect to answer too.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any trends in your field right now?</p>
<p>A: To me, the most notable trend is revisiting very fundamental questions with molecular and imaging tools that we could only dream of 15-20 years ago.</p>
<p>Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?</p>
<p>A: Open Science is only common sense in the academic world of publicly funded research. From day one as a graduate student you learn that no matter how good your ideas, they are useless if you don’t share them with the world. The best science is of no use if other researchers don’t have access to it. Therefore, putting your research behind a paywall makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>As anyone who’s ever had to scold their dog for stealing food off a plate or jumping onto that oh-so-tempting forbidden sofa can attest, dogs are pretty good at understanding what we’re saying to them — at least when it suits them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023969013000325">Research</a> has also shown that dogs are able to understand some aspects of human communication, perhaps because throughout history we’ve used dogs for their ability to respond to our commands. Words, hand signs and gestures, tone of voice and facial expression — it seems that dogs have the ability to understand them all. But what about human understanding of dogs?</p>
<p><span id="more-38656"></span></p>
<p>Federica Amici from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and colleagues ask just that in their latest piece of research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52938-4"><em>Scientific Reports</em></a>.  First, the team recruited participants with a variety of experiences with dogs and who grew up in a variety of cultures, each with their own cultural attitude towards the animals. Parts of Europe, for example, have generally dog-positive cultures: people consider their dogs to be part of the family, and they live inside the house. In Muslim-majority countries, on the other hand, dogs live outdoors and are not considered to be family members.</p>
<p>The researchers therefore recruited 88 adult and 77 child participants from four demographics: non-Muslim European dog-owners and non-Muslim European non-owners; Muslim non-owners from countries with a majority Islam population but who had lived in Europe for at least three years and Muslim non-owners living in a Muslim country. Regardless of demographic, there were a range of attitudes towards dogs amongst participants.</p>
<p>Participants were then shown facial photographs of 20 dogs, 20 chimpanzees and 20 humans, all displaying various different emotions — happiness, sadness, anger and fear — or a neutral expression, and rated how much each picture represented each emotion. They were also asked about the context in which each photo was taken — did they think a dog was playing with a trusted friend, for example, or was it about to attack someone?</p>
<p>Results suggested that although some ability to recognise dog emotions exists from early on in life, it is largely a skill we acquire through experience. The children’s ability to recognise emotions was similar across the board: experience with dogs, or growing up in a culture receptive to them, did not have much of an impact on how well children performed in the task.</p>
<p>But in adults, cultural experience played a large role. Whether or not they owned dogs, participants who had grown up in a European, dog-positive culture were far better at recognising dog emotions than those who had grown up in a Muslim country (even if these participants had later moved to Europe). This pattern of results only held for dogs, too: all groups performed equally well when it came to assessing chimpanzee emotions.  As you might expect, both adult and child participants were able to recognise human emotions better than they were dog emotions.</p>
<p>“These results are noteworthy because they suggest that it is not necessarily direct experience with dogs that affects humans’ ability to recognize their emotions, but rather the cultural milieu in which humans develop,” Amici <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/1555195/humans-ability-to-read-dogs-facial-expressions-is-learned-not-innate">says</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all groups performed better if asked to recognise the <em>context</em> of images rather than asked to name the emotions outright, suggesting that our ability to interpret emotions may rely on the cues we get from any given situation.</p>
<p>The focus of the research was somewhat narrow. Only a select few cultural groups were involved in the study, and it’s unclear whether the findings can be generalised to European and Muslim groups more broadly, as cultural attitudes can be complex and nuanced. Pictures of dogs only depicted those with a “German shepherd-like face”, meaning results may differ with other breeds and face types, and there are many people who have different experiences with dogs — non-owners who are experts, for example.</p>
<p>But studying how experiential factors influence our recognition of animal emotions could be one strand in a further examination of cultural differences in emotion recognition. And it might just help you understand your own pet better, too.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52938-4">The ability to recognize dog emotions depends on the cultural milieu in which we grow up</a></p>

There is no bioassay-based evidence that these molecules are human pheromones, yet “the attraction of studies on androstadienone (AND) and/or estratetraenol (EST) seems unstoppable” (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375873/" target="_blank">Wyatt, 2015</a>).<br /><br />{Curiously, the SexyLife ad accurately lists the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neurosteroids#Pheromones_and_pherines" target="_blank">putative male pheromones</a>, although their depicted functions are pure fantasy.}<br /><br />Unstoppable it is.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post is a request for comments on the preprint </span><a href="https://osf.io/m2bce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Repository Selection: Criteria That Matter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via this</span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/RepoCriteriaFeedback"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of the authors of the preprint (full list available there)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At PLOS we have long advocated for and developed data policies to ensure that datasets, as well as other digital products associated with articles, are deposited and made accessible via appropriate repositories and platforms. Research questions, study design, and data all contribute to the full and accurate story of science. These policies are also, since 2016, informed by the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizations </span><a href="https://fairsharing.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIRsharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://datacite.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataCite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have joined forces with a group of publisher representatives (authors of this work, including PLOS) to propose a set of criteria that are important for the identification and selection of data repositories, which can be recommended to researchers when they are preparing to publish the data underlying their findings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work aims to </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce complexity for researchers when preparing submissions to journals </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase efficiency for data repositories that currently have to work with multiple publishers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplify the process of recommending data repositories for publishers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work aims to make the implementation of research data policies more efficient and consistent and improve approaches to data sharing by promoting the use of community-approved reliable data repositories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers who generate and reuse data are key stakeholders in the research data lifecycle. However, the first target audience for this work is other journals and publishers, repository developers and maintainers, certification and evaluation initiatives, and other policymakers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite you to read the </span><a href="https://osf.io/m2bce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that describes the work, its motivation, its relations to other initiatives, and provide feedback via this </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/RepoCriteriaFeedback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran's journal club where he discusses the paper <a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8770161">What an "Ehm" Leaks About You: Mapping Fillers into Personality Traits with Quantum Evolutionary Feature Selection Algorithms</a>. The abstract is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This work shows that fillers - short utterances like "ehm" and "uhm" - allow one to predict whether someone is above median along the Big-Five personality traits. The experiments have been performed over a corpus of 2,988 fillers uttered by 120 different speakers in spontaneous conversations. The results show that the prediction accuracies range between 74% and 82% depending on the particular trait. The proposed approach includes a feature selection step - based on Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms - that has been used to detect the personality markers, i.e., the subset of the features that better account for the prediction outcomes and, indirectly, for the personality of the speakers. The results show that only a relatively few features tend to be consistently selected, thus acting as reliable personality markers</p>

<p><strong>A ketamine-based intervention could help heavy drinkers cut down on their alcohol consumption, </strong><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/ketamine-disrupts-memories-help-heavy-drinkers-cut-back1">reports Kelly Servick at <em>Science</em></a><strong>. </strong>Researchers gave drinkers a single dose of ketamine, with the aim of disrupting the associations they had formed between the sights and smells of beer and the reward they got from consuming it. Months later, the participants were drinking far fewer pints.</p>

<p><strong>“All humans have biases – simplified ways of thinking when we need to process our thoughts quickly. Accent is no exception: we all have automatic associations with accents based on people we’ve met during our lives. It’s only when we rely on these simple stereotypes to judge unrelated traits, like intelligence or competence, that our cultural baggage becomes discrimination.” </strong>At <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/british-people-still-think-some-accents-are-smarter-than-others-what-that-means-in-the-workplace-126964">Devyani Sharma writes about her research</a> into people’s perceptions of different British accents — and how these attitudes can lead to prejudice against those who are already marginalised.</p>

<p><strong>Being hungry doesn’t automatically make us more angry, despite the popular belief in “hanger”</strong>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/health/food-anger-emotion-psychology.html">writes Benedict Carey at <em>The New York Times</em></a>. Research has found that people only become hangry in circumstances where they (mis)interpret the unpleasantness of huger as a feeling of annoyance towards others. And, as we reported recently, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/11/when-were-hungry-we-remain-surprisingly-helpful-and-co-operative/">even very hungry people remain surprisingly helpful and co-operative</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A study out this week led to a bunch of outlets proclaiming that one in four teenagers are “addicted” to their phones — but the real story is much more nuanced than that</strong>. At <em>New Scientist</em>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2225248-teens-arent-addicted-to-their-phones-but-we-like-to-think-they-are/">Clare Wilson explores why so much of the media coverage got it wrong</a>.</p>

Studies have shown that students who write their notes are better at explaining the concepts they are learning about, seemingly because pen-and-paper note-taking involves a deeper form of cognitive processing than simply typing out a lecturer’s words verbatim.</p>

<p>VR has become affordable and accessible to consumers. Neuroscience research can benefit from the tight control of visual and auditory stimuli and the immersion that VR can afford. I compiled a list of the opportunities that cheap, commodity VR headsets bring to human neuroscience. </p>



<h3>What can you do with VR?</h3>

<p>The graphics in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12403993">this 2002 review</a> are dated, but the content is still relevant for today. VR has remained in use in neuroscience, typically:</p>



<ul><li>Navigation and memory: blocked light VR can be used to simulate navigation in different environments, either on a treadmill or in large empty room. We can study people’s navigation strategies, how cognitive maps develop, or how uncontrolled changes in the environment can hurt memory.</li><li>Visual psychophysics<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37016">: VR allows the precise presentation of binocular visual stimuli</a>. </li><li>Body representations and illusions: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3122">we can study body representations by modifying how one’s body is rendered</a>. We can also create convincing representations of an arm that has been amputated or create full-body illusions. It’s even possible to change one’s body representation to that of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613976/a-vr-illusion-that-makes-us-think-we-have-a-spiders-body-could-change-gaming/">an animal with a different body plan and study how representations evolve</a>.</li><li>Motor learning: thanks to precise tracking, we can study how complex motor skills are acquired and evolve over time. </li><li>Rehabilitation and clinical research: stroke survivors can benefit from immersion in a virtual environment where their loss of function is not readily visible. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3122">Burn victims feel pain relief by immersing themselves in a cool environment</a>. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1545968317751677">People with visual hemi-neglect can benefit from a functional evaluation in an ecologically relevant environment</a>.</li></ul>



<h3>Consumer hardware</h3>



<p>What’s really changed is the new opportunities brought by cheap consumer and prosumer headsets. I’m talking specifically about headsets with 6 degrees of freedom (6dof) tracking, that track both the orientation and the position of the hand, and are available for anywhere between 500 and 3000$ US. These headsets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with some popular examples including:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset - 128GB - Windows - Oculus Quest - 128GB Edition" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D9OsZmWxL._SX679_.jpg" />The Oculus Quest standalone VR product</figure>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_US">The Oculus Quest</a>. This standalone headset doesn’t require a computer and can be carried in a cereal-box-sized carrying case with a total weight of less than 2 lbs. That makes it the most portable 6dof headset on the market right now.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/">Oculus Rift S</a> and Windows MR headsets such as the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/hmd/windows-mixed-reality/hmd-odyssey-windows-mixed-reality-headset-xe800zba-hc1us/">Samsung Odyssey</a>, which are tethered to a computer with a beefy GPU. These use inside-out tracking, which means there’s no extra equipment (i.e. lighthouses) to install. They can be still be somewhat mobile with a gaming laptop. Access to a beefy GPU, however, means development can be easier because we are not resource-constrained.</li><li>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Valve Index</a>, a higher end headset with controllers that don’t need to be constantly gripped, allowing a larger range of applications when looking a motor skill acquisition. This one requires lighthouses and therefore is not very portable.</li><li>The <a href="https://enterprise.vive.com/ca/product/vive-pro-eye/">HTC Vive Pro Eye</a>. This brings eye tracking to the table, important for visual neuroscience applications. It also supports affordable foot representation and representing real objects in the virtual world with <a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/vive-tracker/">extra trackers</a>.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I worked for Oculus Research/FRL for two years, so I’m more familiar with Oculus products. Please mention it if I’ve missed an important piece of hardware.</p></blockquote>



<p>These can be connected to many accessories that can potentially improve the range of opportunities, for instance treadmills, external tracking sensors for full body tracking, and devices that bring <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">hand presence without controllers</a>.</p>

<h2>What does VR commodification mean for the lab?</h2>



<h3>Better tools</h3>



<p>Many old reviews of VR in neuroscience state that the tools are hard to use. I dinstinctly remember sitting in an undergrad class well over ten years ago with <a href="https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/veronique-bohbot">Dr. Veronique Bohbot</a> sharing how she struggled with Unreal tournament to implement an 8-arm maze.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7187" data-attachment-id="7187" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=748" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png" data-orig-size="2072,1092" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=1024" />Valem developing a Beat Saber clone in Unity</figure>



<p>The tools have come a long way since then. To give you a concrete example of this, this tutorial shows Valem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh4k0Q1Pl7E">making a Beat Saber clone in VR in Unity3d in 10 minutes</a>! Experiences can be developed in a GUI and immediately tested on a development PC. They’re accessible for someone with a programming background, and are often free for personal or academic use. The most commonly used tools are game engines with support for VR experiences:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, which is programmed in C# and is quite approachable for beginners. There are frameworks built on top of Unity, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01242-0">the Unity Experiment Framework</a> and <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0173-4">VREX</a> to make it easier to create human behaviour experiments.</li><li><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a>, which is scripted in C++. It tends to have a steeper learning curve but the rendering is top-notch, which can be important for immersion.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, there are tools that are built especially for researchers. <a href="https://www.worldviz.com/vizard-virtual-reality-software">Vizard is a research platform</a> that allows one to script experiences in Python. It has plugins for a lot of specialized research-grade hardware (extra trackers, data gloves). It also has comprehensive data management features built-in, e.g. replaying interactions, processing data in realtime with numpy/scipy, and streaming data out in realtime.</p>



<p>For more specialized visual psychophysics, <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/api/visual/rift.html">PsychoPy</a> and <a href="http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/PsychVRToolbox">Psychtoolbox</a> support the Oculus Rift, Rift S and the Quest via the Oculus Link. Rounding out the picture is WebVR and frameworks built on top of it like <a href="https://aframe.io/">aframe</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/">THREE.js</a> which allow VR content to be authored in HTML and delivered via a web browser. </p>



<h3>More content</h3>



<p>Programmers and grad students don’t often have a background in 3d modeling. Nevertheless, complex environments and situations can be created with existing tools. The Unity store contains a wide range of free assets for download, from trees to grass textures to fully developed games. <a href="https://poly.google.com/">Google Poly showcases pre-built objects</a> that can be readily imported into Unity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/arcgis/products/city-engine/assets/city-engine-tabcontent-5-steps-3-add-3d.jpg" />A city generated from within <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/esri-cityengine/overview">CityEngine</a></figure>



<p>The content can be personalized to the subject to make it emotionally  salient when that’s relevant. If you’re studying navigation, for example, you can recreate the neighborhood or even the whole city you’re in, complete with buildings and textures, with tools like CityEngine and <a href="https://www.citygen3d.com/">CityGen3d</a>. </p>



<p>Subjects themselves may have emotionally salient content that they can use, in particular 360 degree panoramas which can be taken with commodity mobile phones. I remember vividly the first time I viewed a panorama taken in Sequoia National Park three years prior – I felt transported. I cried. This is exactly the kind of stimuli you’d want if you’re studying the interaction of emotion, memory, and navigation, and it had been sitting in my Google Photos for 3 years.</p>

My photo,</figure>



<p>3d scanning and 360 degree cameras also allow content to be created. There’s a big ecosystem of tools to create VR content so students and postdocs don’t have to become artists to make their experiments work.</p>



<h3>Better apps</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Beat Saber splash page" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-td44JfPbcZ9C8VFzUOZNwUTDc=/0x0:780x439/1200x800/filters:focal(540x73:664x197)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65779656/EKVBFK7WoAAuRaM.0.png" /><a href="https://beatsaber.com/">Beat Saber</a></figure>



<p>VR has already had its first million seller with Beat Saber. Hundreds of available VR games and experiences can potentially be used fruitfully in neuroscience research.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cneuromod?lang=en">The Courtois Neuromod project</a> aims to record hundreds of hours of fMRI and MEG data from a dozen subjects. Subjects play 16-bit era games in a scanner, engaging a wide range of cognitive processes: visual and auditory sensory, planning, 2d navigation, reward, motor commands, etc. This turns the concept of gamification on its head: the game is the experiment. The subjects don’t fall asleep, and do they do actions which are ecologically relevant. VR games could add to the mix 3d navigation, locomotion, embodiment, tool use, and so forth.</p>



<p>One issue with applying this to VR game is that researchers will want to have access to the source code to hook into existing games and export useful information, e.g. position of the hands, head, and world. Many clones of popular games  are available on the Unity Store, with their source, for a pittance. Researchers may also consider reaching out to game development studios to add features to their games to allow this exporting, or even to develop games made for research from the ground up, as the success of Sea <a href="http://www.seaheroquest.com/site/en/">Hero Quest</a> shows. </p>



<h3>At-home experiments</h3>



<p>Installing VR has become much simpler with inside out tracking. That’s especially the case with the Oculus Quest, which doesn’t require a computer. It’s not impossible to think of lending a subject a headset for a multi-day task, for example to look at learning effects in visual or motor tasks.</p>



<p>We can think of it as a smaller scale version of crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Here, however, the hardware is tightly controlled. This could be especially useful for people studying rehabilitation, e.g. in the case of stroke – the progression of rehabilitation can be tracked every day.</p>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>VR commodification means is that you don’t have to be a <em>VR lab</em> to do VR in your lab. Development is straightforward and the equipment is cheap, so it can be integrated as one component into a larger project. That offers many  new opportunities for enterprising labs to learn more about the brain.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>From <a href="https://theconversation.com/digital-detoxes-are-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem-106460">digital detoxes</a> to the recent Silicon Valley fad of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/13/20959424/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-trend-neuroscience">dopamine fasting</a>”, it seems more fashionable than ever to attempt to abstain from consuming digital media. Underlying all of these trends is the assumption that using digital devices — and being on social media in particular — is somehow unhealthy, and that if we abstain, we might become happier, more fulfilled people.</p>
<p>But is there any truth to this belief? When it comes to social media, at least, a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2019.1688171">new paper</a> in <em>Media Psychology </em>suggests not.  In one of the few experimental studies in the field, researchers have found that quitting social media for up to four weeks does nothing to improve our well-being or quality of life.</p>
<p><span id="more-38626"></span></p>
<p>Many past psychological studies into social media have relied on correlational data, looking at how individual differences in social media use (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">or “screen time” more generally</a>) relate to well-being. That makes sense: it’s far easier to look at existing patterns of use than to conduct a controlled experiment, particularly in a world where we are all using digital media every day. But it also makes it hard to separate out cause-and-effect — even if social media use is associated with poorer well-being, how can we be sure that already unhappy people are not simply using social media more often, for instance?</p>
<p>So in their new study, Jeffrey Hall and colleagues at the University of Kansas decided to add to the fairly sparse experimental literature by looking at what happens when people actively avoid using social media. The researchers assigned participants to one of five groups: one was told to simply continue using social media as normal (specifically Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram), while the others were told to abstain from all four platforms for periods of 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. The researchers set up accounts to follow each participant and check that they were not posting or engaging with other people’s posts during this time.</p>
<p>At the end of each day for the entire four week period, participants recorded the proportion of time they had spent doing various activities (e.g. eating, working, watching TV, using the internet and so on). They also completed short questionnaires measuring well-being, quality of life and loneliness.</p>
<p>After excluding those who had used social media during the days they were supposed to abstain, the researchers were left with 130 participants. They then fed all of the participants’ data into statistical models, to figure out whether there were any differences in the measures of well-being between abstinence and control days, and if so, whether these effects depended on how long people abstained for.</p>
<p>But the team found that there were no significant effects, regardless of how many weeks participants were off social media. “[D]ays when participants were free to use four types of social media and days when they abstained from using social media were indistinguishable in terms of end of day loneliness, affective well-being, and quality of day,” they conclude.</p>
<p>This finding is not entirely surprising. The results of the few other experimental studies conducted so far have been mixed: abstaining from social media (or decreasing use) has resulted in <a href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751">small reductions in loneliness</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334650">greater “cravings” to be back online</a>, but also a lack of significant effects on several other measures of well-being. Taken together, these findings suggest that “correlational research that reports a negative influence of social media should be interpreted with greater scrutiny,” write the authors.</p>
<p>The new study is not without limitations: in particular, the sample size wasn’t huge, and the authors acknowledge that they did not have enough participants to detect any small effects that might have been present. On the other hand, if abstaining from social media does produce tiny effects that are only apparent when looking across massive samples, then those effects might have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">little practical relevance in the real world</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, the researchers had no way of making sure people were not passively using social media on their abstinence days, scrolling through their Twitter or Instagram feeds without actually posting anything themselves, for example. And while the study indicates that quitting social media may <em>generally</em> be of little psychological benefit, it’s unclear whether certain individuals might get more out of abstaining than others.</p>
<p>Still, the research does suggest that panics linking social media use to poor mental health are overblown. Of course, there may be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974832/facebook-google-surveillance-data-assault-privacy-amnesty-international">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/04/i-worked-political-ads-facebook-they-profit-by-manipulating-us/">other</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-propaganda">reasons</a> to go cold turkey on social media — but for now, it’s not clear that our psychological well-being is one of them.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">If you are left revolted by the sight of someone failing to wash their hands after visiting the bathroom, or by the idea of people engaging in sexual acts that you consider unacceptable, you’re more likely to be politically conservative than liberal, according to previous research. But now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167219880191"><span class="Hyperlink0"><span style="color: black;">new study</span></span></a><span class="None">, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, challenges the idea that disgust is an especially conservative emotion.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Julia Elad-Strenger at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, and her colleagues found that some scenarios in fact make liberals more disgusted than conservatives. “Taken together, our findings suggest that the differences between conservatives and liberals in disgust sensitivity are context-dependent rather than a stable personality difference,” the team writes. </span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38615"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Disgust is thought to have evolved to aid in the detection and avoidance of pathogens before they can enter the body. It entails a feeling of revulsion as well as thoughts of potential contamination of the body. And it’s thought that moral disgust developed from this biologically-focused response: faeces and rotten meat (which could harbour disease-causing bacteria) are disgusting, but so are perceived moral transgressions (incest, for example).</span></span></p>
<p>Over the past ten years, studies have found that people who are more readily disgusted by a variety of triggers are more likely to be politically conservative. Researchers have suggested that this is because conservatives are more concerned with “purity”-related moral transgressions than liberals, and so are more sensitive to potential “contaminators” within this realm.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">To test these ideas, <span class="None">Elad-Strenger and her colleagues initially studied groups of German students. These groups consisted of roughly equal numbers leftists (most liberal), centrists and rightists (most conservative). The participants completed a general disgust sensitivity questionnaire, which assessed how often and how much they felt disgusted in daily life, and were also presented with various potentially disgust-eliciting scenarios. Some of these were designed to be “liberal” disgust-elicitors (scenarios concerning tax evasion, racism, xenophobia and capitalism, for example) while others were potentially more disgusting to conservatives (those referring to homosexuality, the consumption of illegal drugs and a homeless person begging for money, for instance). The participants were asked to rate how disgusted and angry each of these scenarios made them feel.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The team found no relationship between scores on the general disgust scale and political orientation. Neither did the conservatives report more disgust overall than the liberals. However, liberals were more affected by the liberal-disgust scenarios, while conservatives were more disgusted by the conservative-disgust selection (especially those relating to homosexuality). “Taken together, these results challenge the notion that conservatives are generally more disgust-sensitive than liberals,” the researchers note.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">A further study of 190 German students explored scenarios involving body-related disgust (for example, seeing dog faeces or seeing someone not washing their hands after going to the bathroom), and also “pathogen disgust” (standing close to someone with body odour, for example). Overall, there was a positive correlation between conservatism and total disgust scores, but this was small. A closer analysis revealed that it was only the scenarios involving bad personal hygiene that triggered more disgust among conservatives, suggesting conservatives aren’t generally more disgusted than liberals, but perhaps experience more disgust in a few specific cases.</span></span></p>
<p>In a further study, the team looked at the responses of 202 American participants. The American liberals and conservatives responded in much the same way to the various individual scenarios as the Germans — with liberals more disgusted than conservatives by xenophobia and capitalism, for example, and conservatives more disgusted by homosexuality, for instance.</p>
<p><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">This study “provides further evidence that the relation between conservatism and disgust sensitivity can be positive, negative or nonsignificant depending on the nature and content of the disgust sensitivity measure,” the researchers write. Overall, their work suggests that claims that conservatives are more easily disgusted stem from an over-generalisation of findings related to specific triggers.</span></span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/0aX73fhL8UY/">A note on the Joint statement on EPA proposed rule and public availability of data</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today a group of editorial leaders from several  publishers, including PLOS, have co-published an </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editorial </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlighting concerns about the “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This comes eighteen months after the same group published an </span><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/eaau0116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editorial </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the rule was first proposed, in April 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our concern is that the EPA proposal will eliminate from consideration in policy-making evidence from many peer-reviewed studies of prime importance to public health. The new proposed requirements do not reflect the norms or capabilities of the field and overreach even PLOS’ progressive data sharing policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS has always supported open sharing of research data.The 2014 update to the PLOS Data policy introduced a requirement for data sharing at publication and was the first of its kind to be applied by a publisher broadly across many disciplines. Since then, PLOS journals have published more than 124,000 articles with a data availability statement indicating where and how relevant data can be accessed, and many other journals have followed suit by adopting encompassing data policies. We continue to champion data sharing as an essential practice of Open Science that supports reproducibility and re-analysis thereby increasing trust and fostering faster scientific developments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But our policy also recognizes that open public sharing of research data is not always possible, especially in studies where participant privacy can be at risk. Where that may be the case, we </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider exceptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we work with authors, editors and reviewers to find ways to satisfy the need for scientific scrutiny while protecting research participants’ privacy. This sometimes means that the data cannot be made publicly available and our experience shows that finding appropriate solutions can be challenging and costly. Too often, researchers are faced with the limitations of the existing infrastructure available to them for sharing and managing data derived from research on human health. We acknowledge these challenges and will continue to work with stakeholders towards better infrastructure to responsibly share sensitive data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the EPA proposed rule recognizes the value of transparency in research, it is designed to apply beyond publishing research into that of regulatory decision-making. Rule making should be informed by the best available evidence, weighted appropriately on the basis of factors that may affect its level of uncertainty or readiness for generalization. Imposing a stringent standard of full data availability for scientific evidence before it can be considered by the EPA would have the consequence of limiting the pool of relevant, peer-reviewed scientific evidence that informs policy-making, both in its number and its diversity. This would have disastrous consequences for public health.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/610242476/0/oupblogpsychology/">The truth about ‘Latinx’ [a revision]</a></h4>

<p>In recent years, the term <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx">Latinx</a> has become popular in academic settings in English to designate a group of people without reference to gender, which is designated by -o and -a endings in some Romance languages. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@ThinkNowTweets/progressive-latino-pollster-trust-me-latinos-do-not-identify-with-latinx-63229adebcea">While academics and Twitter users have begun to use the term, only 2% of the U.S. population actually identifies with this word.</a> Latinx has become so widely used that Elizabeth Warren has taken to using it on the campaign trail. This has led to a reflection on its political implications in a recent Ross Douthat piece <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nyti.ms/2JSDPcK">in the <em>New York Times</em>.</a> The interesting question is why a term that is thought to help unify a large group of people would fail to gain wider traction.</p><p>Since Spanish is my mother tongue, I can understand why this term would befuddle Spanish speakers. From a linguistic perspective, it makes no sense to create a genderless word in a gender-marked language. Yes, the -o and -a endings signal the grammatical gender, such as in the terms <em>niño and niña. </em>But the endings for the adult form are not always straightforward, such as in <em>el</em><em>hombre</em> and <em>la mujer.</em> In fact, all nouns carry grammatical gender and some of these end in -o/a (i.e. <em>la tierra)</em> and others do not (i.e. <em>el arbol</em>). Finally, even within categories that have similar meanings there can be variation. In Spanish, it’s <em>el puma</em> and <em>la pantera.</em> But in Italian, one would say <em>la tigre.</em> Confused yet? Grammatical gender is confusing, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://lightonspanish.com/the-gender-of-animals-in-spanish/">especially with regard to animals.</a></p><p>With all this confusion, Spanish speakers lose a connection between sex and gender. No one would be insulted if they are considered part of <em>el pueblo Latino</em> or <em>la gente Latina.</em> Just because someone says I am part of <em>la gente Latina</em> doesn’t make me feel that they are referring only to women. For a speaker of this class of Romance languages, the notion that gender and sex are the same thing makes little sense. Yes, gender originates in sex but it is not the same thing when it comes to non-sexed nouns.</p><p>The problem arises when we use a gender-marked Romance language term in English contexts. For example, one day I ran across a cover for <em>Newsweek</em> that characterizes Selena as “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onnewsstandsnow.com/collections/newsweek/products/newsweek-selena-the-life-and-legacy-of-tejanos-queen?variant=7841788788789">Tejano’s Queen</a>.” I was confused by this. Did they mean <em>Tejano’s</em> (i.e. people from Texas) music? The word music was never used so I kept on reading. I found that the special issue was “proud to present Selena, a 100-page tribute to the most beloved Tejano singer of all time.” Oh, so she was a Tejano singer and the reference was to music. But, in fact, she would be <em>una cantante de musica </em><strong><em>Tejana</em></strong>or <em>una cantante </em><strong><em>Tejana</em></strong>. Either way, the gender would be feminine not masculine. <em>Tejana</em> and <em>Tejano</em> had been masculinized to the latter. This is not unusual for Anglophones. You might remember the once Terminator, and now ex-Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger stating “No problemo.” The problem (no pun intended) is that it should be <em>No hay problema.</em> Again, an Anglophone (probably the scriptwriters) “masculinizes” a Spanish noun. Spanish has two genders but for some reason Anglophones think there is only one. Thus, what grammatical gender is and is not becomes entirely lost when moving to a language where gender and sex are the same thing.</p><p>But let’s leave my linguistic perch for a second and think about the implications of the term <em>X</em> is. The term <em>X</em> is sought as one that would be all inclusive. The term reminds me of algebra where <em>X</em> represents a variable that has no defined meaning. As such it is perfectly suited for equations where a term is unknown. In this case, it can take on any value and in human terms would represent a more inclusive term.</p><p>The problem with creating a new genderless word, is that it already exists in gender-marked languages that have a true neuter. In Latin, <em>-a</em> is the plural neuter. In this language, the inclusive term would be Latina, plural without reference to gender. The tricky part is that Latina is also used for feminine singular nouns in many Romance languages, and therefore would not be interpreted as gender neutral. In recent years, some Spanish speakers facing the same dilemma have preferred the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://remezcla.com/culture/latinx-latine-comic/">ending <em>-e</em></a> to create a more inclusive term. Rather than using a synthetically, anglophonically derived ending such as <em>X</em>, we could opt for a more organic one that arises from a gender-marked language. In that sense, <em>Latine</em> is all-inclusive and derives from a language that sought to create a genderless ending system. Spanish is after all a descendant of Latin, the natural language of science and the one used to represent complex concepts in English.</p><p>If you miss the <em>X</em>, you could tune in for reruns of <em>The X-Files</em>. Here, you would be presented with the motto “The truth is out there,” which also applies to our search for a genderless all-inclusive term. If modernization is what we seek, we could opt for the new term in Spanish <em>Latine</em>. Alternatively, we could choose <em>Latina</em>, the original word from Latin. Which one do you prefer?</p><p><em>Correction: An <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/">earlier version</a> of this article incorrectly stated that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” The author has offered this updated article to address this. We regret the error.</em></p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: “Spanish Dictionary” by Abigail Luke.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/610230020/0/oupblogpsychology/">Connecting families through open adoption</a></h4>

<p>The term “open adoption” is unfamiliar to much of the general public, and yet it describes the reality of adoption today. These are adoptions in which there is some contact or exchange of information between birth families and adoptive families, before or after the adoption. With growing awareness of the benefits of openness for children and families, the vast majority of adoption agencies—95%—do not facilitate closed adoptions (the old adoption arrangements, where no identifying information was shared between adoptive and birth families).</p><p>Historically, many people have surmised that a clean break between adopted children and their birth families enables both parties to move on. We now know that is not true. Openness benefits kids by providing them with biological continuity and not denying them the truth of their origins and background, thus aiding in identity development. It benefits birth parents as well. Given that birth parents are unlikely to forget the children they place for adoption, openness may help to alleviate their pain and guilt. For adoptive parents, openness can ease fears and questions, reassuring them about the permanency of the adoption, and promote empathy toward the birth parents.</p><p>It was research on the benefits of open adoption—and the downsides of closed adoptions—that, over time, moved adoption agencies to gradually shift their practices towards that of facilitating open adoptions. So what does open adoption look like in practice?</p><p>The realities of open adoption are complex. Some adoptive and birth families exchange basic information through the adoption agency, either before adoption or on an ongoing basis. No information is shared directly between parties. Adoptive parents send photos and updates to the agency, which pass these on to birth families, who can respond in kind—again, through the agency. Other families have direct contact with one another. Contact of any type may range from fairly regular and frequent to infrequent.</p><p>Among families who are initially hesitant about the idea of open adoptions, most ultimately embrace it, as they grow to understand and appreciate the benefits of openness—and to view it as less unfamiliar and scary. Far more common than stories of adoptive parents who wish for less contact are stories of adoptive parents who long for more contact, especially over time, as their children grow older. Indeed, sometimes birth parents drop out of contact (due to mental health, substance abuse, or housing issues, or pain and loss associated with the placement), and this is typically very challenging for adoptive parents, who recognize that the birth parents’ presence (or absence) would likely become more significant for their children over time—not less.</p><p>As one lesbian adoptive mom, Mariette, puts it: “It’s been very disappointing for me because we did an open adoption and we<em> really</em> wanted there to be more of a connection.” A heterosexual adoptive dad named Matt describes how his 8 year-old son was struggling with a loss of contact with his birth mother: “That realization of, ‘Why doesn’t she want to have contact with me?’ We’re getting those questions now. We tell him, ‘We wish we had contact with her too.’ Recently we’ve been involving him in the letters that we send to her. We ask, ‘Is there anything you want to add?’”</p><p>Family relationships are complex—and those between adoptive families and birth families are no exception. Sometimes adoptive parents express sadness or even frustration with birth parents—such as surrounding their ongoing mental health or substance abuse struggles, which are often among the issues that had led them to make an adoption plan in the first place. Yet alongside feelings of sadness, disappointment, or frustration, these adoptive parents are often also deeply committed to and appreciative of their children’s birth parents, recognizing all that they are up against and continuing to value them their children’s first, and birth, parents. Deb, a lesbian adoptive mother, has a particularly nuanced set of feelings about her daughter Marlo’s birth parents, explaining that,</p><p>“The fact [is] that they have certain issues that might impact their ability for a healthy relationship with Marlo [child]. That’s part of why they chose us to raise her. I think there will be some sad lessons ahead, but I think one thing that makes it easier is their decision to place her with us was a decision made out of love. They loved her.  . .and they made one of the toughest decisions of their lives. We feel that every time we talk with them in person or on the phone; you can feel that pain still. It’s awful to witness and it must be horrible to feel, but that pain comes from the fact that they do love her. If we can help her know that they love her, that she wasn’t abandoned, that would be one of the greatest gifts I think we could give her”.</p><p>Deb’s quote illustrates what so many stories reveal: the power of acknowledging, in all its complexity, the pain and the beauty in adoption. Open adoption, in its best sense, means acknowledging and embracing complexity, rather than wishing it or willing it away. It means a both/and perspective, not an either/or perspective. It means staying present to loss—and inviting in connection. It means doing family in a way that is authentic and real, and not the stuff of storybooks. All families are complex. Families in open adoptions are perhaps especially complex—and, in an ideal world, deeply aware of and in conversation with that complexity.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit </em><em>by Ben Kerckx from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/heart-love-romance-valentine-700141/"><em>Pixabay</em></a><em>.  </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/connecting-families-through-open-adoption/">Connecting families through open adoption</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/610230020/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/610230020/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/610230020/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/12/how-address-enigmas-everyday-life/" rel="nofollow">How to address the enigmas of everyday life</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/why-young-people-suffer-more-from-pollution/" rel="nofollow">Why young people suffer more from pollution</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/" rel="nofollow">The truth about ‘Latinx’ [a revision]</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Having a bit of a fuzzy memory is not an uncommon side effect of having had too much to drink the night before — and the details we do remember are often somewhat limited. The same can also be true for our attention when drunk: we’re only able to concentrate on what’s going on in front of us and not what’s happening elsewhere.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been termed “alcohol myopia”: attentional shortsightedness related to alcohol consumption. A new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119882856">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> suggests this shortsightedness may apply to human faces, too — and that it could have an impact on how well people can identify perpetrators of crimes they witness while drunk.</p>
<p><span id="more-38599"></span></p>
<p>To explore the idea, Alistair Harvey and Danny Tomlinson recruited 76 students from a particularly apposite place — a university bar. Participants, all of whom had normal or corrected to normal vision, were first shown twenty-one photographs of young white adult male faces. Then five minutes later, they saw a selection of these “old” faces again, amongst a number of previously unseen “new” faces of the same demographic and description.</p>
<p>Some faces were shown in full, while others showed only “external” features such as hair and face shape, or direct “internal” facial features like the eyes and mouth. Participants were asked to identify which photographs showed old faces and which showed new ones, and indicate how confident they were in their identifications on a scale of one to nine.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_38604" style="width: 445px;"><img alt="faces" class=" size-full wp-image-38604 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="38604" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="faces" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=445" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png" data-orig-size="445,187" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/26/drinking-alcohol-focuses-our-attention-on-the-external-features-of-faces-with-implications-for-eyewitness-memory/faces/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=845" />Examples of full, external and internal faces shown to participants, <em>via <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119882856">Harvey and Tomlinson (2019)</a></em></figure>
<p>Surprisingly, full face recognition was not any worse in those who had been drinking alcohol compared to sober participants. But drinkers were more likely to recognise external faces than their internal facial features, and those with greater breath alcohol levels performed worse when it came to these internal faces.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar faces are normally encoded “holistically” — individual features and their relationship to each other are all integrated into a whole memory. But the team suggests that alcohol disrupts this process, thus making memory more feature-based than holistic.</p>
<p>And the finding could have implications for how intoxicated witnesses later identify criminal suspects: the encoding bias towards external features could make witnesses less likely to identify a perpetrator who has changed or disguised their hair, for example — or more likely to falsely identify an innocent line-up filler with similar external features.</p>
<p>How gender impacts this phenomenon is yet to be established: all photos were of men, but women tend to have more diverse hairstyles, so there may be differences in memory of male and female faces, as previous studies with sober participants have suggested. Would more diverse styles and colours of hair make external features more distinctive and therefore easier to remember, for instance?</p>
<p>The study is obviously limited by its design: unrecorded drug consumption may also have impacted participants’ ability to remember faces, and their history and their relationship with alcohol wasn’t examined. How much and how frequently someone drinks could be an additional influence on memory.</p>
<p>But the research does suggest that facial recognition is affected in subtle and often counter-intuitive ways by the consumption of alcohol. When it comes to remembering exactly who you met the night before, this might not seem like too big a deal. But when witnessing a crime, our ability to recall what we saw may not be so insignificant.</p>

Anthelmintic drugs are frequently used to control these infections, but this has resulted in the emergence of anthelmintic-resistant (AR) helminth populations. AR has been detected in all major helminth species across Europe and globally and threatens effective control of parasitic infections.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.combar-ca.eu/">COST Action COMBAR – Combatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants</a> – is a European based working group that aims to advance research on the prevention of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in helminth parasites of ruminants in Europe and disseminate current knowledge amongst stakeholders.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11467" style="width: 409px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11467" height="210" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/COMBAR-2019-300x158.jpg" width="399" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Group photo of third COMBAR Joint Working Group meeting, Ghent, Belgium (27-29 August 2019)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The third joint Working Group and Management Committee meeting of COMBAR was held between 27<sup>th</sup>-29<sup>th</sup> August 2019 at Het Pand situated in the historical center of Ghent, Belgium. 125 participants from 31 countries and 5 continents attended the three-day meeting. Key opinion leaders and specialists discussed their research and innovations for sustainable helminth control with the central theme being “Anthelmintic resistance in ruminants: Who cares?”. This topic was addressed through four main themes with keynote and oral presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Theme 1: Diagnosing the impact of anthelmintic resistance</strong></p>
<img alt="Domino, Hand, Stop, Corruption" class="aligncenter" height="260" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/03/09/11/49/domino-665547_960_720.jpg" width="400" />
<p>“Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is globally one of the most important societal challenges and economics plays an important role in combatting antimicrobial resistance”, said <a href="https://www.luke.fi/en/henkilosto/jarkko-niemi/">Jarkko Niemi</a> of <em>Natural Resources Institute Finland</em>. Although AR may be considered part of the bigger AMR problem, it should not be confused with antibiotic resistance as the involved pathogens, drugs, impacts, and mechanisms are different. The financial impacts of AR to farming can nevertheless be substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Theme 2: Sustainable parasite control</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody has a role to play in sustainable parasite control</p></blockquote>
<p>“Everybody has a role to play in sustainable parasite control”, said Gustavo Sabatini of <em>Boehringer-Ingelheim Animal Health</em>. The pharmaceutical industry has an important role in directing investments towards the development of efficacious parasite control solutions that are both safe to the environment and food consumer. If every stakeholder plays its role accordingly, it will be possible to extend the lifetime of current antiparasitics with negligible harm to the environment and, at the same time, to develop the solutions for sustainable and effective parasite control programs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Theme 3: Enhancing transatlantic collaboration on helminth research</strong></p>
<img alt="Microscope, Research, Scientific, Lab" class="aligncenter" height="271" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/02/27/00/32/microscope-3184432_960_720.jpg" width="405" />
<p>“Consideration of the many factors that affect the outcome and interpretation of the current field test for AR <em>[the fecal egg count reduction test]</em> has made it obvious that a simple protocol leads to significant variation between test outcome”, said <a href="https://vet.uga.edu/person/ray_m-_kaplan/">Ray Kaplan</a> of <em>University of Georgia</em>, USA. Ray leads a group of specialists developing new guidelines for field diagnosis of AR. He proposed that separate procedures should be followed for field and research use.</p>
<p><strong>Theme 4: Preserving drug efficacy</strong></p>
<img alt="Ireland, Sheep, Lambs, Livestock, Animals, Closeup" class="aligncenter" height="299" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/16/19/54/ireland-1985088_960_720.jpg" width="399" />
<p>Deborah Maxwell of <em>ParaBoss </em>said that “In Australia, they have eight regional programs based on a cohesive set of anthelmintic resistance management principles that are adapted to regional conditions”. Adapting grazing management results in immediate reductions in the need to use anthelmintics, while genetic breeding for sheep resistance has not given clear results so far.</p>
<p>A session was also devoted to young scientists to report on their short-term scientific missions (STSM). Six young scientists had the opportunity to present the outcome of their STSM.</p>
<p>“This experience was important for my personal and scientific growth because it was a great opportunity to learn and improve techniques for the diagnosis of worm infections in cattle.”  – Alessandra Amadesi, University of Naples Federico II, Italy</p>
<p>“Knowledge and skills acquired during this STSM enabled me to introduce new anthelmintic resistance diagnostic methods to our laboratory” – Marcin Mickiewicz, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Poland</p>
<p><strong>What progress has COMBAR achieved so far? </strong></p>
<p>At the mid-point of the <a href="https://www.cost.eu/">European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)</a> action, COMBAR has made considerable progress in fulfilling its <a href="https://www.combar-ca.eu/about#objectives">aims</a>. To date, 32 countries are part of the action with 180 working group members, with nearly 40% of participants being early-career researchers. Fourteen STSMs have been completed so far involving 12 countries. Two successful training schools have been held on advances in diagnosis of helminth infections and AR, and the socio-economic aspects of helminth infections and AR. To date, COMBAR continues to disseminate information to the veterinary community and has published five scientific articles, including two key-opinion papers “<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922(18)30237-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS147149221830237X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">100 Questions in Livestock Helminthology Research</a>” and “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/control-of-helminth-ruminant-infections-by-2030/5E2B8A7B2CFF4E9A7AEA35E33FC7AD9A">Control of helminth ruminant infections by 2030</a>“.</p>

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club where he discusses his results from his Ph.D. research documented in the preprint: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/810846v1">Growth rules for the repair of asynchronous irregular neuronal networks after peripheral lesions (Sinha et al. 2019)</a>. The abstract is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model, simulations of which accurately reproduce network rewiring after peripheral lesions as reported in experiments, to study these activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we deafferent a biologically realistic network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed model of homeostatic structural plasticity and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network are both necessary for successful rewiring of the network.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Geriatrics-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><blockquote><p>Advanced vascular access planning and use of an AVF versus a tunneled catheter has previously been associated with better outcomes and less mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>A large proportion of time in late chronic kidney disease (CKD) care is devoted to dialysis preparation and, for those pursuing hemodialysis, establishment of a vascular access.  Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are considered the gold standard given their longevity and lower risk of infection.  Guidelines from <a href="https://kdigo.org/">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)</a> and international nephrology societies advocate for advanced planning for dialysis vascular access, including the consideration of preserving arm veins, vein mapping prior to surgery, and early referral for vascular surgery. Advanced vascular access planning and use of an AVF versus a tunneled catheter <a href="https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2004090748">has previously been associated</a> with better outcomes and less mortality.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11460 aligncenter" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Consultation-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>For nephrology providers, the creation of an AVF access has become a checkbox exercise in the pre-dialysis management of patients with advance CKD, and the consideration of the impact this vascular access has on patient’s kidney function can be lost.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1607-4">recent study</a> by Benard <em>et al., </em>published in <em><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Nephrology</a>, </em> looked at the impact of AVF creation on the rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in pre-dialysis patients.  Within this retrospective cohort of 146 patients, crude annual estimated GFR (eGFR) decline rates were -3.6ml+/-4ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> pre-AVF and -2.28+/- 3.56ml/min/1.73m<sup>2 </sup>post-AVF creation, suggesting that the AVF creation may have a reno-protective effect.</p>
<p>Comparative findings have previously been reported in the literature. In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfv082">retrospective study</a>, 123 CKD patients undergoing AVF creation experienced a drop in the GFR decline rate from 5.9 to 0.5ml/min/year when looking at the 2 years prior and after AVF creation. Similarly, in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfw220">cohort</a> of 3026 CKD veterans, the rate of GFR decline decreased from -5.6ml/min/year to -4.1ml/min/year.  This highlights a need for future work into understanding the possible underlying mechanisms contributing to the reduction of GFR decline.</p>
<p>We know that the AVF functions as a low resistance circuit that provides afterload reduction and increased cardiac output. But is it possible that these hemodynamic changes help with blood pressure reduction and increased renal perfusion, slowing the rate of patient’s GFR decline?</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11459 aligncenter" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Arteriovenous-Fistula-300x225.png" width="300" />
<p>The possible benefits of AVF creation on kidney function may promote their use for slowing progression of CKD in addition to the recommended guidelines for managing pre-dialysis patients. Furthermore, if future studies demonstrate AVFs slowing GFR decline, there may be a greater acceptance by patients to move forward earlier with dialysis planning, to preserve their kidney function.</p>
<p>While more prospective studies in this area are needed to determine the mechanisms and impact of AVF on kidney function, these recent findings from Benard <em>et al. </em>highlight a need for Nephrologists to consider the impact of AVF creation beyond their primary role as a hemodialysis vascular access.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though fidget spinners have been around since the early 1990s, it was 2017 when they really started to make a stir, becoming a seemingly overnight sensation and starting to appear in offices, classrooms, public transport and pretty much anywhere else they were permitted. The actual provenance of the design has been debated, but many companies market the toys as a tool for concentration, particularly for those who have anxiety, ADHD or autism.</p>
<p>Calming — and fun — they may be, but do they actually work when it comes to keeping attention? Julia S. Soares &amp; Benjamin C. Storm from the University of California, Santa Cruz think not. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/acp.3610">new paper</a>, they look at the marketing of fidget spinners as attentional aides — and come to the conclusion that they may be actively distracting.</p>
<p><span id="more-38584"></span></p>
<p>To examine the effect of fidget spinners on attention, the team asked 98 undergraduates to watch an educational video lecture about the process of baking bread while either using a fidget spinner or not; a further half of those not using a fidget spinner watched the lecture near someone who was. They were then asked to report any lapses in attention, and took a memory test for the material.</p>
<p>If the logic of the marketing held, those playing with fidget spinners should have outperformed those who were not. But in fact they did not report any fewer lapses of attention than participants from the non-spinning condition, and actually performed significantly worse in the memory test (those who were only <em>near</em> others using them didn’t show a drop in performance).</p>
<p>But could this result have been because participants weren’t used to using the toys? In the second experiment, the team recruited participants who had neutral or positive views of fidget-spinners, removing any potential participants who had negative opinions in a pre-study screening.</p>
<p>A total of 48 participants then replicated the first experiment, this time while watching ten minute videos about Hawaiian ruler Kamehameha the Great and Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. Afterwards, they completed a fifteen-item memory test.</p>
<p>Results seemed to suggest that positive attitudes towards fidget spinners had no impact on how distracting they were: again, those in the spinner condition performed worse on the memory test overall than those in the no spinner condition, and reported more lapses of attention.</p>
<p>The team says their findings add to a growing literature on the potentially negative impact of fidget-spinners on attention. Other studies have shown increased attentional impairment due to fidget spinner use — in some cases, this was even true for those with ADHD, a group that the toy is allegedly meant to help.</p>
<p>Many of those involved in the study were using fidget spinners for the first time; results may be different for those who no longer attach any novelty value to the objects and who may be less likely to become distracted by their use. But parts of the second experiment, which specifically focused on those with a positive attitude towards the toys, do seem to suggest that this is not the case.</p>
<p>As Soares and Storm stress in the paper’s conclusion, such findings don’t mean fidget spinners have no worth, nor that they should be completely banned from the classroom. But perhaps ironically for an object often used so mindlessly, it may be worth thinking more carefully about what impact they’re having.</p>

<img alt="Anelosimus studiosus individual" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Anelosimus-studiosus-individual-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Pet owners will recognize that their animals exhibit substantial individual differences in behavior. For example, some dogs are curious and independent when they visit a new place, while others are timid and watch their owners’ reactions. Researchers studying animal behavior now understand that such differences among individuals of the same species, sometimes called ‘animal personalities’, are common and shape how individuals interact with their environment.</p>
<p>Readers might be surprised to learn that, despite their diminutive size, spiders have been the focus of intensive study on such variation in animal personality.  Some spider species exhibit a suite of coordinated behavioral traits that vary among individuals but are remarkably consistent within a given individual over time. These behaviors generally fall along a continuum between ‘boldness’ and ‘shyness’. Bold individuals recover quickly from feigned attacks and have a short latency to attack a newly entangled prey item, while shy individuals tend to play dead for longer and take more time before attacking prey.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, these personality traits have been investigated in a variety of ecological and social contexts in spiders of the genus <em>Anelosimus</em>. Although previous multi-generational studies provided evidence that some personality traits are likely to be passed from parents to offspring, we lacked an understanding of the genetic basis of these complex behavioral traits. Even beyond spiders, studies of the genetics of behavioral traits lag behind those investigating physical traits, such as coloration. There are several reasons for this. First, measuring behaviors is challenging since it must be done with living organisms. Second, researchers expect that behaviors will be shaped by both genes and the previous experience of each individual, so there is unlikely to be a perfect association between genetic variation and behavioral traits. Finally, given the complexity of many behavioral traits, we expect them to be influenced by multiple genes, and our ability to detect such a pattern is limited.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spiders exhibit behaviors that are consistent in each individual over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, identifying genetic markers associated with a trait of interest is important because it allows us to investigate the origin and underlying causes of a behavior. Genetic markers also become a valuable tool for future studies. A <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6172-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study in <em>BMC Genomics</em></a> seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by identifying genetic markers associated with personality traits in the spider <em>Anelosimus studiosus. </em></p>
<p>Today, advances in genomics facilitate genetic association studies in organisms that have not been the focus of previous genetic research. To use these emerging tools, Jonathan Pruitt and I sampled spiders along rivers and lakes in eastern Tennessee. We used standard behavioral assays, called ‘startle tests’, to determine the recovery time of each individual after a disturbance (in this instance, puffs of air applied to the spider’s body). Individuals that moved very quickly after this treatment were considered to be bold, while those that played dead for several minutes were considered to be shy. Since this species dwells either in multi-female social groups or in solitary nests in this environment, we also noted the social structure of each source colony.</p>
<p><img alt="Anelosimus group" class="size-medium wp-image-11454 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Anelosimus-group-300x300.jpg" width="300" />Pruitt and his colleagues previously demonstrated that social groups are comprised of both bold and shy individuals, so these two variables (sociality and boldness) were considered separately. After we scored these behavioral traits, we used double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (or ddRADseq) to sequence approximately 0.1% of the genome of each of more than 200 spiders. In parallel, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of one individual. Although the genome assembly remains highly fragmented due to challenging characteristics of spider genomes, including large size and high content of repetitive DNA sequences, this genome helped us to determine the relative positions of our ddRADseq markers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we identified a cluster of seven genetic markers that were associated with boldness in spiders. At each marker, individuals carrying two copies of one sequence (= homozygotes) tend to be bolder, while those homozygous for the other sequence tend to be shier. Heterozygous individuals (in other words, those with one copy of each sequence) tend to exhibit an intermediate recovery time. These markers are associated with one another, and this region of the genome explains 11% of variation in boldness.</p>
<blockquote><p>Genetic markers link to each other to shape the individual ‘personality’ of each animal.</p></blockquote>
<p>This indicates that this genomic region has a pronounced effect on personality, but also suggests that this is not the only portion of the genome that influences personality. We do not yet know whether these markers are within a gene, or whether this genomic region instead influences gene regulation. We did not find any marker associated with the social structure of each individual. For both social structure and personality, our genome scan likely missed interesting variation, since we only surveyed a portion of each individual’s genome.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the discovery of a genetic basis for personality traits in spiders opens up a variety of new research directions. Characterizing the genes near the newly identified genomic region and investigating their function will start to reveal how they shape behavior. At the level of the organism, we can measure how each genetic variant influences the success of individuals and groups. At the population level, we can investigate the mechanisms that maintain this genetic variation.</p>
<p>Overall, this study takes an exciting first step toward merging contemporary animal behavior and genetics research in this widespread and fascinating species. More broadly, this discovery helps open the door to understanding animal personality in a broader group of organisms, since the phenomenon is so pervasive in animals.</p>

<h2>From natural to artificial intelligence</h2>



<p>Humans are intelligent, and by emulating humans, whether at the level of circuits, algorithms, affordances or objectives, we could create intelligent machines. There’s a cogent explanation of how that’s worked in the past and <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3">how that might work in the future in this editorial from Deepmind</a>. There’s two concrete examples that people often point to:</p>



<ul><li>Convolutional neural nets, which are inspired by the visual system, ultimately from the work of Hubel and Wiesel</li><li>Reinforcement learning, loosely inspired by the behaviour of the basal ganglia</li></ul>



<p>In addition, there’s a long tail of smaller ideas; for instance, the idea of using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450">different types of normalization</a> to facilitate gradient based learning (whether the role is the same in the brain and in machines is another question, but that’s a story for another day). </p>



<h3>Constraining deep neural nets with brain data</h3>



<p>It’s a lot easier to name instances where neuroscience has inspired AI almost by accident than to make a coherent research program based off of that idea. But some people are trying.</p>



<p>One idea is to use brain data (neurophysiological recordings or fMRI) to constrain deep neural nets to a good subspace with high performance. Leila Wehbe from CMU presented some ideas along these lines, fitting a language model pooling both fMRI and text doccuments. She mentioned that right now, joint training predicts the fMRI data well but the results are equivocal on language tasks. </p>



<p>It might just be a question of the vastly larger amount of text data than brain data. Pierre Bellec aims to collect hundreds of hours of brain data (MEG and fMRI) from a dozen subjects as part of <a href="https://twitter.com/cneuromod?lang=en">the Courtois Neuromod project</a>. These large scale projects could generate the vast amounts of data necessary to train ANNs with brain data exclusively. Very recently there was a proof of concept that showed more robust classification <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05072">using brain data from mouse visual cortex as a prior on image classification</a>. These are very early days but I think this approach will work eventually. The only question is whether it will ever be economical to use this method (i.e. 500$ an hour to run an MRI scanner versus pennies per classification on mturk). </p>



<h3>Genes as an information bottleneck</h3>



<p>Another very popular idea that has been put forward by many groups is that there are two scales of learning in human brains:</p>



<ul><li>a human lifetime scale, i.e. a lot of unsupervised learning, a sprinkle of reinforcement learning, and the tiniest sliver of supervised learning that happens over a single person’s lifetime. This timescale might involve changing billions of <em>weights</em> (synapses) in the brain.</li><li>the evolutionary timescale, i.e. the massive information bottleneck that comes from the tens of thousands of genes we have to encode a nervous system composed of billions of neurons. </li></ul>



<p>There’s an underlying sub0idea that many individual neurons don’t matter all that much in this context. This is a point that’s been made by many recently, most notably <a href="http://See also this recent paper for a collection of related ideas.">in an editorial in Nature Neuroscience by a huge group with Konrad Kording as the senior author</a>.</p>



<p>Tony Zador had a talk provocatively titled “a critique of pure learning” that made the point (see also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582643v1">his paper</a>) that humans and animals don’t really learn all that much. Instead, they have a number of built-in behaviours that get refined after birth; most of the intelligence is innate.</p>



<p>Evolution follows fundamentally different dynamics than the common gradient-based learning algorithms that are commonly used in deep learning. Instead of an objective that is optimized by nudging the current estimate of weights, an ensemble of learners carry forward traits that can mutate or be exchanged. </p>



<p>One interesting consequence is that different kinds of emergent collective behaviours with high fitness can emerge: cooperative, individualistic, etc. Evolution moves the whole population towards one of many deep local optima. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2969154">These are not the benign saddlepoint extrema</a> or relabeling equivalences of deep learning that can be dealt with stochastic gradient descent. You need new mathematical machinery to understand these ensembles, namely complexity theory (aka complex systems). It’s a really fascinating area of mathematical physics (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RCF2WSV/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">here’s a book on the subject</a>) that is ripe to be explored more in the context of neuroscience. Blaise Aguera y Arcas showed some very early work on this problem and I think it will prove ebullient in the next few years.</p>



<h2>Artificial to natural intelligence</h2>



<p>There was also a number of talks on improving neuroscience research with the tools of AI. Many of the student posters followed the basic template:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I used machine learning method X to solve neuroscience subtask Y and got results Z</p></blockquote>



<p>I think this is a good first step. The bigger impacts come when we create generic machine learning systems that can used for a lot of different problems. For instance, Mackenzie Mathis spoke about <a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut">DeepLabCut, which can segment animal videos to quantify behaviour</a> in the lab and which has already had a huge impact. We also saw Gael Varoqueux, one of the people behind <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn</a>. Just think of the number of papers that use the logistic regression implementation in sklearn – that is some high impact! </p>



<p>Yannick Roy presented a poster on a Kaggle-like environment quantifying performance for a wide range of EEG datasets and algorithms. The competition should reveal which models achieve state-of-the-art performance; these models can and boxed so people can download a pre-trained models. This will unlock state-of-the-art performance for non-experts, e.g. clinical researchers.</p>



<h3>Separability and manifolds</h3>



<p>People are starting to ask whether artificial neural networks and real neural networks work similarly to solve the same kinds of problems. Sue Yeon Chong presented some interesting work continuing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17631409?dopt=Abstract">the thread that Jim DiCarlo</a> started several years back, namely that linear separability increases in natural and artificial neural nets as a function of depth, creating a reservoir of linearly separable manifolds [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644658v1.full">see this recent related paper</a>]. She pulled straight from the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_theory">VC theory</a> on complexity and capacity to define the capacity of a neural population in terms of convex hulls and pairwise linear separability. </p>



<p>There were also some strong claims about the importance of neural manifolds in understanding neural responses. Someone (I didn’t jot down whom) claimed that neurons are random projections from the neural manifolds. Do single neurons not matter anymore? Sara Solla showed some beautiful neural manifolds in the context of the control of a cursor via motor cortex. There was a linear projection of the neural activity preserved over days despite neurons dropping in and out of recording; furthermore, there was a linear transformation from neural space to manifold space preserving the spatial structure of the task, which is quite cool. My impression, however, is that in the context of the control of a cursor, only 3 variables matter: x, y and t. So we can embed a task that lives in 3 dimensions in a 3 dimensional neural space – what have we learned? I feel like making higher dimensional version of these tasks will be crucial to make strong claims about the importance of neural manifolds. People have started working on this in the context of vision, and the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/374090v2.full">manifolds there are much higher dimensional</a>, which must reflect the statistics of the task itself.</p>



<h3>Causality</h3>



<p>One thing that kept creeping into many talks is the idea of the usefulness of the tools of causality in research. Patricia Conrod presented very interesting and controversial results on computational psychiatry. She made a causal claim that marijuana use in adolescents decreased their grades, using observational data and the tools Judea Pearl’s do-calculus. I have rarely seen an audience so visibly upset! It felt like listening to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22691267">Rite of Spring in 1913 Paris</a>.</p>



<p>Causality is hugely important in epidemiology research, and people are starting to really hone in on its role in neuroscience at large. Konrad Kording <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0466-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_social-science">recently wrote an article on the use of causality in neuroscience</a>, focused on the tools of econometrics. Recently, it’s been shown that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/253351v4">there’s a link between causal estimation and the credit assignment problem</a>. This suggests that neurons could perform something similar to gradient descent without global, symmetric signals; see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01689">this paper from Blake Richards about this line of work</a>.</p>



<h3>BCI</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I have massive imposter’s syndrome for applying to jobs after seeing this talk</p><cite>Postdoc friend</cite></blockquote>



<p>Amy Orsborn presented a really impressive body of work on BCI, following from her work at Bijan Pesaran’s and Jose Carmena’s labs. The basic idea is that BCIs allow one to perform manipulations of the brain that separate different learning processes that often conflated. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5660637/">Take a look at this editorial for more info</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Can we all just define consciousness before talking about it?</p><cite>Suzanne Still</cite></blockquote>



<p>I heard the C-word (consciousness) from Yoshua Bengio. The counterpoint is that we don’t really what consciousness is and in the absence of knowledge we’re having a circular discussion. I think it’s a – very – interesting discussion to have over a glass of wine but my TL;DR is it’s not science yet and it’s unlikely it will be in my lifetime. But it was still cool!</p>



<p>Verdict: really great food for thought here. Creeping up to top three conferences (with Photonics West and CCN). If you’re on the East Coast by all means come next year.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/weight-training-protects-the-ageing-brain/">Weight training protects the ageing brain</a></h4>

<p>Thanks to Blake Alec Miranda from the <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/myassa/">Yassa Translational Neurobiology Laboratory</a> at the University of California, Irvine for this article on resistance training and brain health.</p>
<hr />
<p>I (Blake) live in Los Angeles where it seems like everyone and their grandmother is obsessed with fighting fat and building muscle. It’s a stereotype that we SoCal lifers embrace, but don’t take too seriously.</p>
<p>Yet, I didn’t realize how ubiquitous exercising had become until my actual grandmother messaged me over Instagram a few months ago asking about a brand of running shoes. Rather than question how my 75-year-old grandma made an Instagram (and why she still hasn’t followed me back, for that matter), it got me thinking about the effect exercise can have on the lives of our oldest adults.</p>
<p>Speaking with Dr Sarah McKay, it was almost serendipitous that we got to talking about the Study of Mental and Resistance Training (<a href="https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/10/25/increasing-muscle-strength-can-improve-brain-function--study.html">SMART</a>) study that examined resistance training and its relationship to cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Clinical trial suggest lifting weights protects against dementia</h2>
<p>The Study of Mental and Resistance Training (SMART) is a clinical trial conducted by Maria Fiatarone Singh and collaborators at the University of New South Wales and the University of Adelaide. Singh recruited 100 adults aged 55-86 from the surrounding community diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)</p>
<p>People with MCI suffer from significant memory impairment but they’re still able to live independently. It is often considered a precursor to dementia as neurodegeneration progresses with advanced age, and many clinical trials are interested in slowing this decline at the MCI stage.</p>
<p>Singh and her team assigned their recruits to one of four training groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>computer cognitive training + stretching exercises</li>
<li>computer cognitive training + resistance training</li>
<li>watched videos/quizzes + resistance training</li>
<li>watched videos/quizzes + stretching exercises</li>
</ol>
<p>For six months the over-55s come into the lab-gym for closely supervised weight training two or three days a week.</p>
<p>The over-55s cognitive outcomes were tracked using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive scale (ADAS-Cog) and multiple measures of working memory. A follow up at 18 months was conducted after study completion.</p>
<p>After six months, those who lifted weights with sham cognitive training (group 3) showed improvement in their ADAS-Cog.</p>
<p>Dr Yorgi Mavros one of the researchers involved says,</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>What we found in this follow up study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains.</p>
<p>The stronger people became, the greater the benefit for their brain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Contrary to expected, group 2 who received full doses of resistance training + cognitive training performed <em>worse</em> than those lifting weights alone.</p>
<p>Singh suggests he combined intervention, which was both mentally and physically challenging, could have resulted in excessive stress, less engagement in-home or community-based activities, or other changes that inhibited rather than promoted neural plasticity and cognitive benefits.</p>

<p>It depends.</p>
<p>SMART makes a strong case for resistance training, but it’s not the end of the story.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular exercise alone has also shown similar promise in protecting against cognitive decline, and the degree to which physical fitness interacts with genetics, sex, and other risk factors for dementia is still unclear.</p>
<p>Singh says,</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>The next step now is to determine if the increases in muscle strength are also related to increases in brain size that we saw.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the researchers make a compelling case for introducing resistance training into our lives, and we can all benefit from a healthy lifestyle that balances cardio, weights and diet.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting, the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population.</p></blockquote>
<p>says Mavros,</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>The key however is to make sure you are doing it frequently, at least twice a week, and at a high intensity so that you are maximising your strength gains. This will give you the maximum benefit for your brain.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em>Freddy Parker</p>
<p>How did you sleep last night? If the answer is “badly” followed by an uninvited pang of anxiety, look no further for an explanation than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0754-8">a study</a> published this month in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>.</p>
<p>A lack of sleep is known to lead to feelings of anxiety, even among healthy people. But the new paper reveals that the amount of “deep” or slow-wave sleep is most pertinent to this relationship. That, the authors conclude, is because slow-wave brain oscillations offer an “ameliorating, anxiolytic benefit” on brain networks associated with emotional regulation.</p>
<p><span id="more-38556"></span></p>
<p>To investigate this link, Eti Ben Simon and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, ran a series of experiments. First, the team recruited 18 students to come into the lab: once for a full night of shut eye, and again for a night of no sleep. In the evening and the following morning, participants filled in a questionnaire to measure their anxiety levels. And in the morning they also viewed emotionally-charged, aversive videos while the researchers looked at brain activity using functional MRI.</p>
<p>In contrast to a night of sleep, after the all-nighter scans revealed reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16700-010?casa_token=Cq4OT_7nj1QAAAAA:vEFCoyTkqVb6tDJgygt25c4ngpTrrDmuNlOy3HSGxfFiON5nJWdd4fVCHg7bKV2UNI1BJFEhwZKzWJLZrLabwfs">typically responsible for emotional regulation</a>, whereas deeper emotional centres of the limbic system, such as the<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ne.15.030192.002033?casa_token=gT8VIPTXCPEAAAAA%3AGa9j6WnArUoVMz-VF7k2I-p2usCzF23hCKIgSSlCk6dzkUCVAfem8TsLLDWLGQUttNiCTNnbwxk_5A"> amygdala</a>, appeared hyperactive. That is akin to the brain pressing “heavy on the emotional accelerator pedal, without enough brake”, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uoc--stt110419.php">suggests</a> <span>senior author Matthew Walker.</span></p>
<p>Quite remarkably, half of these sleep-deprived students reported anxiety scores that would normally signal a clinical anxiety disorder. In fact, these scores were directly related to changes in brain activity: those with the steepest drop in mPFC activity reported the greatest spike in anxiety.</p>
<p>How was sleep protecting against these changes? In the video-watching session where participants slept beforehand, those who <span>had</span><span> </span><span>managed more slow-wave sleep had greater activity in the mPFC, and less in the limbic system. It thus appears that deep sleep had restored the brain’s prefrontal capacity to regulate emotions and prevent the escalation of anxiety.</span></p>
<p>It doesn’t end there. The team also conducted an online study in which 154 people of all ages recorded their sleep and anxiety levels over four days. Respondents’ data showed that the quality of sleep predicted anxiety levels the following day, with even subtle disruptions during sleep elevating feelings of anxiety.</p>
<p>Given the high prevalence of <a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/a565b58a-67d1-4491-ab9112ca414f7ee4.pdf">poor sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610617/">anxiety disorders</a> in much of the Western world, understanding the mechanisms that link the two is important. By implication the authors support strategies to improve sleep quality in anxious and sleep deprived populations, and suggest sleep could be an overlooked “non-pharmacological intervention for anxiety”. It’s certainly an admirable agenda.</p>
<p>But the knowledge that a lack of sleep worsens anxiety is hardly soporific. Indeed, having read Walker’s eye-opening book <em>Why We Sleep</em>, by passing it to my mother I had unknowingly triggered her own worries about sleep. Regrettably, she now finds it more difficult.</p>
<p>So could it be that, in some cases, research like this inadvertently exacerbates the problems scientists set out to resolve? <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717301638?via%3Dihub">Reviews suggest</a> that worrying about sleep can do more harm than a lack of sleep itself — so it’s important to consider how we communicate these sorts of findings. As a start, it might be wise to bear in mind the bigger picture: sometimes poor sleep is inevitable and does not necessarily signal disaster. It’s also worth remembering that there are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/07420520601100971?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true"> individual differences that buffer against the negative effects of sleep deprivation</a>, while others even have a <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30652-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662731930652X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">genetic propensity to need less sleep</a>.</p>
<p>However, these arguments shouldn’t let people, or societies, off the hook. Good sleep serves myriad vital functions, not least keeping anxiety at bay. And future research will doubtless continue to highlight the need to teach people about healthy sleep. It just might also be important to figure out how best to do so.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper "Efficient codes and balanced networks".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recent years have seen a growing interest in inhibitory interneurons and their circuits. A striking property of cortical inhibition
is how tightly it balances excitation. Inhibitory currents not only match excitatory currents on average, but track them on a
millisecond time scale, whether they are caused by external stimuli or spontaneous fluctuations. We review, together with
experimental evidence, recent theoretical approaches that investigate the advantages of such tight balance for coding and
computation. These studies suggest a possible revision of the dominant view that neurons represent information with firing rates
corrupted by Poisson noise. Instead, tight excitatory/inhibitory balance may be a signature of a highly cooperative code, orders of
magnitude more precise than a Poisson rate code. Moreover, tight balance may provide a template that allows cortical neurons to
construct high-dimensional population codes and learn complex functions of their inputs.</p>

<p>The climate crisis is a defining challenge of the 21st century. If we keep on the same emissions path, we expect a sea rise of 2 meters, hundreds of millions of climate refugees, a mass extinction of over half of animal species, and decreases agricultural productivity that could leave a billion people starving by 2100. The IPCC report shows 4 paths of carbon reduction that keep warming to 1.5 degrees, each requiring massive changes in personal behaviours, political structure, economy and technology. Every sector of society will need to join the effort.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists are taking notice. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform">The Society for Neuroscience (SFN) recently hosted a satellite event about tackling climate change – more than 80 people participated</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/thefreemanlab/status/1182379104110120960">Jeremy Freeman stepped down from CZI to focus on climate change</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/swaziadam">Adam Aron</a> at UCSD <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter">published an editorial on why climate change needs attention from cognitive neuroscientists</a>; and people like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433">Konrad Kording, Demis Hassabis</a> and <a href="http://www.adammarblestone.org/">Adam Marblestone</a> are publishing detailed breakdowns of the climate crisis.</p>
<p>So what can a neuroscientist do about climate change? Neuroscience is not an engineering discipline, so it’s easy to feel powerless, but I’m going to try to show here we have a surprising amount of agency: personal agency, the power to convince, and the power to invent.</p>
<h1>Personal agency</h1>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform">The SFN event ended in a petition to decarbonize the conference</a>. This includes suggestions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>hosting satellite events closer to home to limit the amount of travel</li>
<li>skipping the conference every other year</li>
<li>integrating teleconferencing to attend remotely</li>
</ul>
<p>As academics, much of our carbon footprint stems from flight. Assuming that the 30,000 attendees travel on average 10,000 kilometers to get to the conference, it’s roughly 70,000 tons of carbon in the atmosphere from air travel only – or the average annual CO2 emitted by 10,000 EU citizens. In research universities, air travel accounts for a large proportion of the carbon footprint of the institutions; for example, it’s estimated that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab33e6/meta">over 50% of the carbon footprint of Université de Montréal is from air travel</a>. <a href="https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/">There are already excellent models for zero-carbon conferences</a>. Traditional international conferences don’t make sense in a carbon-constrained world, and we can refuse to participate in them.</p>
<p>Flying is one of most carbon-intensive behaviours scientists participate in, and one of the highest leverage items. Neuroscientists also consume resources to run their labs, and these resources – and the embodied carbon – are wasted when the products of the research are not shared. This is a strong argument for open science. A salient example of resource use is training state-of-the-art deep learning models, trading GPU cycles for classification accuracy. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243">One recent analysis estimated a carbon footprint of half a ton of CO2 for training a single NLP model (BERT); an architecture search over different networks yielded numbers in the hundreds of thousands of tons</a>. Computational neuroscientists should share their trained models to prevent the wasted resources from re-training. Experimentalists should also share their data for the same reason. Data carries an embodied carbon footprint from the materials used to collect it (plastics, animal facilities, the carbon used to ship materials across borders, etc.), and publishing the existing data makes more use of the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>Although I’ve focused on activities specific to scientists, we can participate in the same carbon-cutting behaviours recommended for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>having fewer children</li>
<li>living car-less</li>
<li>eating a plant-based diet</li>
<li>using green energy</li>
<li>living in more modest houses</li>
</ul>

<h1>The power to convince</h1>
<p>About 70% of people in the US believe that climate change is happening; that leaves 30% of people that remain to be convinced. Furthermore, only a small fraction of believers act. Neuroscientists, as teachers and science communicators, can help people graduate from disbelief to disengagement to action.</p>
<p>Scientists have a lot of influence. They are consistently ranked among the most trusted professions in the US, and they can bring attention to important matters via teaching, their online presence and their political influence. <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter">As Adam Aron points out in his editorial</a>, people are more convinced about the urgency of the climate crisis when communicators adopt themselves a low-carbon lifestyle. So scientists’ power to convince is gated by their own adoption of the behaviours they want to see in the world.</p>
<p>As academics, we have a higher standard of what it means to understand something, so before we go convincing, we have the duty to become well-informed. I think we can all take time to better understand the mechanisms of climate, the evidence for it, and its consequences. Plenty of resources are available to learn these materials; <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact">a very good starting point is Michael Mann’s class on edX</a>. Those more inclined to learn about the solution space should read the <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/">late David Mackay’s book</a>.</p>
<p>Given that we’ve changed our own behaviours and learned how climate change works, we need to find ways to amplify our own actions and convince others to act. This forum can be the classroom; <a href="https://osf.io/t8s4k/">Adam Aron’s class on climate change psychology</a> gives us a template. This also has to include political activism; we can vote for parties that support carbon taxes and decarbonization; join grassroots advocacy groups; and support and participate in civil disobedience.</p>
<p>At the research level, Adam Aron argues that cognitive neuroscientists can help the climate crisis by studying the mechanisms by which people acquire beliefs about climate change, how they propagate through their social networks, what kinds of messages they best respond to, and what motivates them to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/">For example, a group at MILA is working on generating flooded images</a> of people’s homes so they can experience for themselves what it will be like to live in with a 6 foot sea level rise. The hypothesis is that people are emotional decision makers and will respond best to emotionally-loaded messages. These kinds of approaches are ripe to be studied from both a neuroscientific decision-making perspective and an econometric efficacy perspective. What causes people to graduate for disbelievers to believers? What causes people to move from belief to action? And how many tons of CO2 could we keep in the ground if we convinced 1,000 people?</p>
<h1>The power to invent</h1>
<p>Many readers of this blog are technologists, engineers and programmers in addition to neuroscientists. Technological innovation will be crucial to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. Software allows us to communicate climate change, to visualize it, predict it, plan for it, and mitigate it. Physical engineering will allow us to build the large-scale structures required to keep carbon in the ground. <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">Bret Victor wrote an excellent blog post</a> on how technologists can help climate change, and it is a very encouraging read. A  consortium of machine learning researchers, including Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis and Konrad Kording wrote <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">a sprawling 100-page paper with a companion website</a> on how artificial intelligence can help climate change. By all means, if you’re a machine learning expert, pick a section in the paper labeled high leverage, and go work on it.</p>
<p>Engineering is a very small part of neuroscience today, but it will grow in near future. Mainstream (i.e. 10M+ units) consumer-grade BCIs will likely appear on the market in the next 10 years. Meanwhile, decarbonization scenarios that will keep warming to 1.5 degrees will require sustained efforts over the next 80 years. Neuroscience research that might be considered far out has the potential to have massive impact in the future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Warning: speculation, thought experiments, future episodes of Black Mirror ahead</p></blockquote>
<p>There are opportunities at the growing convergence of AI and neuroscience. Suppose, for instance, that by studying the brain, we discover an algorithm that opens up a rich area of AI (e.g. reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, few-shot learning, causal inference, etc.). Some of the applications of this algorithm could be used effectively to mitigate climate change. For instance, suppose one of the downstream applications is counterfactual reasoning in life-cycle analysis; then we could very easily optimize a supply chain to minimize the carbon footprint of a given product. In this case, we’re augmenting human reasoning using AI, itself inspired by human reasoning, with the end goal of tackling climate change.</p>
<p>Computers are cognitive enhancers – Steve Jobs called them bicycles for the mind. People also use drugs to make themselves smarter, caffeine being the most salient example. People working on climate change may choose – indeed, may feel a moral imperative – to enhance themselves cognitively. The enhancement of well people (whether with nootropics, psychedelics or empathogens) is a taboo subject, but neuroscientists working on these areas  enhance the human potential to solve problems. The same point can be made about invasive BCIs for cognitive enhancement. Supplementing our memory, or having immediate access to a library of all human knowledge, could make us radically smarter, and more effective at fighting climate change.</p>
<p>Finally, humans could eventually choose to radically decrease their carbon footprint by leaving their physical bodies and uploading themselves to the cloud. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">While the capacity to emulate a single human brain in real-time using simplified biophysical models is not here yet, it should be feasible within the next 15 years</a>. The cost of that simulation with today’s efficiency would be around a tenth of the power envelope of the United States. However, efficiency follows a similar trend to Moore’s law, with a doubling in operations per second every 1.5 years or so. At this rate, we could have whole brain emulation at a carbon intensity similar to that of 2019 human by 2055 – at which point uploading becomes carbon efficient, and rapidly more so over time. The carbon-negative technologies introduced in the 2060s might thus include foregoing our physical bodies.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>I’ve highlighted three ways in which neuroscientists can help tackle the climate crisis: by changing their personal habits, by convincing others, and by inventing new ways to a carbonless future. We have to soberly evaluate our actions with respect to their causal impact, and live our lives accordingly. Neuroscience, like every sector of society, will have to change to tackle the defining challenge of this century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i style="color: #2c3338; background-color: #ffffff;"><span lang="EN-US">“The sense of self is a hallmark of human experience. Each of us maintains a constellation of personal memories and personality traits that collectively define ‘who we really are'”.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So begins a <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23055-001"><span style="color: black;">new paper</span></a></span><span class="None">, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, which reveals that who you “are” can easily be manipulated. Just imagining somebody else can alter all kinds of aspects of how you see yourself, even including your personality and memories.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38542"></span></p>
<p>Meghan Meyer at Dartmouth College and colleagues first asked 185 adults to recall a series of personal memories — a time they received good news or helped a friend in need, for example — and rate how they had felt during that event (on a scale ranging from completely negative to completely positive). Using the same scale, participants were prompted to imagine how others would have felt in reaction to the same events: both an “average American” and also a genuine friend who was similar to them in in personality, temperament, major likes and dislikes, beliefs and values.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The participants were then given the original prompts again and asked to rate for a second time their own feelings at the time of the events. The team found these ratings had changed, to become closer to each participant’s assessments of how the others would feel. This effect was particularly strong when the other person was more similar to them — a friend, rather than an “average American”.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For the next study, a fresh group of participants rated themselves on 60 character traits (such as “charming” and “unreliable”), then rated both a friend who was similar to them and also an actual other person — in this case, Walter Cronkite, a former US news anchor — on a subset of 20 of these traits. Next, they rated themselves again. As in the previous study, the participants’ self-ratings changed, becoming closer to those for their friend in particular.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In a second, remarkable part to this study, a very similar result was found when people were asked to imagine the characteristics of something radically different to themselves: the Empire State Building. The participants first rated themselves on various physical traits, such as being “clean” and “asymmetrical”, and then rated a similar friend and the Empire State Building. Finally, they rated themselves again — and as before, their own ratings had become more similar to those given for the two targets (and especially the friend). The team then went on to find that these “simulation-induced” changes in self-knowledge can still be in place 24 hours on.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">How might thinking about other people, or even buildings, reshape your own self-knowledge? The researchers suspect that it happens because when you imagine how someone else looks or would feel and act in a given situation, you’re simultaneously retrieving memories about how you look and how you have felt and behaved in such situations in the past. When your own memories are retrieved, they become vulnerable to modification, which means those imagined reactions can influence your own real ones. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For example, in thinking about how a friend might respond to being dumped, you may find yourself thinking, “Claire tends to be pretty thick-skinned”. When that knowledge and your relevant self-knowledge (eg. “I was embarrassed when I got dumped last year”) are retrieved simultaneously, considering your friend’s predicted response can tweak your own pre-existing self-knowledge. You might then recollect being less embarrassed about your own experience.</span></span></p>
<p>The effect might be especially potent when you’re considering someone who is similar (rather than different) to you, because thinking about such a person should trigger more self-related memories, which would then be vulnerable to being altered, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">So far, the researchers have only checked whether the changes they observed were still in place after a day. It’s not clear yet how long they might last, or whether they would result in any meaningful differences in behaviour. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">But the work does suggest that self-knowledge is just as susceptible to misinformation effects as other types of knowledge, the researchers conclude, adding: “Such findings offer a qualification to the argument that the self is ‘special’.”</span></span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Gender inequality in the business world has been much discussed over the last few years, with a host of mentoring schemes, grants, business books and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/treasury-launches-review-into-barriers-for-women-in-business">political activity</a> all aimed at getting women into leadership positions.</p>
<p>But what happens when this goal is achieved? According to new <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000176.pdf">research</a>, unequal gender dynamics still prevail even at the very top. Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen from the University of Virginia found that women CEOs are judged far more harshly than their male counterparts when a business fails ethically. However, when a failure is down to incompetence, they find, women receive less negative backlash.</p>
<p><span id="more-38534"></span></p>
<p>In the first experiment, 512 participants were given a news article to read about a car manufacturer, and then asked to fill out a survey on whether or not they would buy from the company. A third of participants read about an <em>ethical</em> failure (the company had known of a vehicle’s defect but done nothing about it), a third read about a <em>competence</em> failure (the company had not known about the failure) and a third simply read a description of the company. Gender of the company’s CEO was varied: some participants read that the CEO was named Adam, whilst others read they were named Abigail.</p>
<p>Participants were then asked how likely they were to buy a vehicle from the company, answered questions on the organisation’s competency, dependability and trust, and rated how severe they felt the failure was on a seven point scale.</p>
<p>When an ethical failure had taken place, participants expressed less intent to buy a car from the company if they had read that the CEO was a woman than if they had read it was a man. But when the company <em>wasn’t</em> aware of the defect, they were more likely to report intent to buy if a woman was at the helm. There was no difference in intent for participants who read just the company description.</p>
<p>In the second experiment, 416 participants read the same news article as those in the first — but in this piece of writing, female and male CEOs were described with either “communal” traits, stereotypically associated with women — e.g. “helpful”, “sensitive”, and “good at listening” —  or “agentic” traits associated with men — e.g. “independent”, and “works well under pressure”. Participants were then given the same survey questions as in the first experiment.</p>
<p>When participants read about an ethical failure where the CEO’s traits were congruent with stereotypes — women as helpful, men as strong, for example — results from the first experiment held: intent to buy from the female-led company was lower. But this changed when the stereotypes were inconsistent with the CEO’s gender: participants were less likely to buy from an organisation led by a man described as “helpful” and “sensitive” than one led by a “independent” and “strong” woman.</p>
<p>The team suggests that highlighting such traits in female leaders can “reduce the penalties for female-led organisations”. But <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/02/12/women-shouldnt-have-to-lead-like-men-to-be-successful/">others argue</a> that women leaders shouldn’t give in to the pressure of adopting typically “male” traits, and that being helpful and community-focused are actually positive things to bring to the board room. Leaning into stereotypes may not be the best way, long-term, to break them — but either way, it’s clear there’s still a way to go for women in business.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Ztqtjmb0zu8/">Why engage with preprints?</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/Comment_preprint-image_blog-bubble3-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>This post was co-written by Dan Morgan, Director of Community Relations; Rebecca Kirk, Associate Editorial Director, Madison Crystal, Brand Communications Manager; and Veronique Kiermer; Publisher and Executive Editor</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Preprints enable authors to share their work early, openly, and in a way that is free from journal influence or stylistic preferences. They also open up possibilities for pre-publication commentary that have previously been limited to a group of trusted confidants and hand-selected (often anonymous) peer reviewers invited by the editors. The opening up of comments via email, Twitter, or on the preprint server has the potential to expand the number of voices involved in the peer review of manuscripts, to allow the development of a preprint in parallel with the formal peer review, and to accelerate the research process.</p>
<p>To explore these opportunities, we recently launched a <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/">preprint commenting pilot</a>, which will enable handling editors at PLOS Journals* to better access and utilize comments left on preprinted submissions for consideration in their review of the manuscript.</p>
<p>While the announcement speaks for itself, we also wanted to give more context for our work in engaging with preprints and facilitating comments more broadly. Driven by our work alongside the research community, these fall into three major strategic directions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><strong>1. A more equitable platform for community review</strong></strong></p>
<p>PLOS has always sought the most equitable systems of publishing, for all research and researchers. In preprints we have a posting and reviewing infrastructure that is not based on a closed database of reviewers end editorial board members, but open to all.</p>
<p>In one conversation we might hear from editors who say they struggle to find reviewers for papers, and in another conversation we hear from scientists, especially early career researchers, who are looking for an opportunity to review or edit for a journal, but are not being invited. Editorial work is often labeled as a “volunteer” activity, but it is less a system of volunteering and more a system of being known and <em>chosen</em>, in the current setup. And the best chance of being chosen, of course, lies with those who have been chosen in the past.</p>
<p>By promoting preprints and their commenting infrastructure, PLOS is attempting to even more equitably open up editorial activity to all who have something to offer. And the various tools, vendors, publishers companies (e.g. <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/transparent-review-in-preprints/">TRiP</a>, <a href="https://plaudit.pub/">plaudit</a>, <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a>, <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review">ORCiD</a>, etc.) are developing the infrastructure to enable it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Published outputs should be shaped by the <em>scholarly process</em>, and not by publishers’ preferences or requirements. </strong></p>
<p>PLOS has long empowered scientists to publish great science. Our work as a publisher is essential and important, but it is not a proxy to judge the quality of our authors’ articles. Our journals are selective against a spectrum of criteria, but our efforts are always in <em>partnership with the community</em> whose activities we facilitate.</p>
<p>Some publishers, while they allow submissions that have been preprints, do not engage with them because they view them as a force that is too publisher- or journal-independent — a publishing movement that may one day reduce or even remove the need for journal brands completely. We see an opportunity to learn from our community.</p>
<p>In many ways, preprints represent the purest form of published output. While authors generally still follow standard article conventions, and many preprints have emerged from parallel posting alongside submission to PLOS, this is not a requirement. For PLOS it is extremely interesting to see how authors choose to write up their work when it is being posted on a preprint server, and not being “prepared” for a specific journal or editorial approach. Our hope is that a preprint culture helps empower authors to share their work early, often, and in their preferred way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. More editorial activity is better for all concerned, including researchers but also publishers, and may save everyone time</strong></p>
<p>Our pilot for flagging bioRxiv comments to editors is an attempt to see how useful such comments on preprints are for handling editors, how easy it is for us to identify and push them to the attention of editors, and whether this activity speeds up the reviewing process, increases the diversity of voices reviewing, AND encourages more people to comment on preprints. But the manuscript peer review will not solely rely on this new process–it is in parallel with the standard process and editors will consider the comments at their own discretion, based on how useful they determine the comments to be.</p>
<p>Additionally, for publishers, we believe there is always a need for more reviewers and more editors (especially when you operate one of the biggest journals in the world in <em>PLOS ONE</em>!). We can’t think of a better way to expand the universe of relevant editorial activity than by both enabling a training <em>and </em>providing an open ground for new reviewers to demonstrate their expertise. The availability and openness of preprint comments, in conjunction with our new <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">published peer review history option</a>, is finally surfacing the richness of these activities and resources and. And, as such, we look forward to the training and empowering of more diverse voices and to ever more early career reviewers to joining the process.</p>
<p>We are expecting the results of the pilot to be mostly qualitative — the reality being that at the moment only 10% of bioRxiv preprints receive comments — but we will seek opinions from editors and authors about their experience and we will share our learnings broadly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-8897" height="226" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet-300x164.png" width="413" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248">https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three strategic directions above focus on how engaging with preprints and comments may improve the publishing and reviewing process itself, and move it closer to a fully equitable, community-driven practice. But it would be remiss to not also mention the importance of the increased potential for credit for all research activity, which we will focus on in a future blog post. In short, and in advance, there are many ways that these preprint initiatives are natural extensions of our passion for surfacing credit for all researchers in their activities, already including the <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/">CRediT taxonomy</a> and <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/">ORCID for Reviewers</a>.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Body image can be a tricky enough thing to navigate in adulthood: for young people, it can be even more difficult. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554432/">Research</a> suggests that adolescence is a “pivotal time” for the development of positive or negative body image — and that poor body image can in turn have a devastating impact on overall self-esteem.</p>
<p>But how someone looks doesn’t just change how they feel about themselves — it can change the way other people treat them, too. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20171">One 2013</a> study found that weight was a factor in graduate school admissions, with overweight applicants less likely to receive an offer. And now <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12322?af=R">research</a> published in the <em>British Journal of Educational Psychology</em> suggests this bias can start before students are even in their teens.</p>
<p><span id="more-38519"></span></p>
<p>Past research has found that obesity is related to poorer educational achievement, though exactly why has not been established. Kristin Finn and colleagues at Canisius College wondered whether it might come down to discrimination and stigma, pointing to several other studies that suggest this could be the case. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531092">2013 paper,</a> for instance, found that obesity was related to <em>assessment</em> of academic performance but not to standardised test scores: overweight children were just as smart but not as successful, as that research put it.</p>
<p>To investigate this hypothesis further, the team recruited 133 teachers from suburban middle and high schools in New York State; the teachers were a variety of ages and <span>taught a range of subjects</span><span>. Recruited at staff meetings, participants were asked to take part in a study ostensibly looking at the validity of school grading, and were given a short, handwritten essay on health and fitness to evaluate, written by an eleven-year-old student. The essays had been gathered from a separate classroom writing exercise and chosen precisely because they were of average quality — external educators had rated them neither excellent nor poor.</span></p>
<p>Participants were also provided with a picture of a young girl, purportedly the author of the essay — in one condition, a picture of a ‘healthy’ weight child, and in the other a picture of an overweight child. Photographs were, in fact, of the same girl — one was simply a digitally altered version, designed to add 20 pounds of weight.  After reading the essay, participants filled in a brief survey assessing the student and their essay, and also described their own beliefs about  biases in grading.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team found that teachers believed characteristics such as race, gender, weight or attractiveness had “very little influence” on the grades they gave their students.</p>
<p>But weight did in fact have a significant effect on the scores students received. Teachers were significantly more likely to recommend overweight students for tutoring or remedial help, judged their work as less neat than their non-overweight counterparts, and gave their essays lower grades overall — even though the essays were exactly the same. They also judged overweight students to have worked much harder than non-overweight students — perhaps because they were seen as less capable and therefore in greater need to try. Interestingly, even though teachers gave the overweight students lower grades, they didn’t consider the <em>quality</em> of their essays to be any lower.</p>
<p>The team suggests their findings illustrate the “weight-biased attitudes” often present in teachers: that although students can try just as hard or produce work of equally high quality, stereotypes about what it means to be overweight warp educators’ perceptions.</p>
<p>The study only used images of white girls, so the way that weight interacts with other identities would be worth further research — how does weight interact with race, for example, and do the findings hold for male students, too? The team also notes that their research could be replicated with photographs that were not digitally altered or were full length, and the weight of teacher was also not taken into consideration: would an overweight teacher still hold the same biases?</p>
<p>Tackling bad body image in teenagers is a vital step towards the nurturing of happy, healthy adults. But to do that, deeply enmeshed attitudes towards weight will have to be undone. The first step may simply be acknowledging they exist — it’s notable that teachers were not aware that such biases affected the way they graded. Becoming more cognisant of the various factors that influence how we see other people is key. Overweight students are just as good: they should be treated as such.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology/">The truth about ‘Latinx’</a></h4>

<p><em>Editor’s Note: An updated version of this article addresses the error where the author incorrectly states that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/">Please read the updated article here.</a> We regret the error.</em></p><p>In recent years, the term <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx">Latinx</a> has become popular in academic settings in English to designate a group of people without reference to gender, which is designated by -o and -a endings in some Romance languages. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@ThinkNowTweets/progressive-latino-pollster-trust-me-latinos-do-not-identify-with-latinx-63229adebcea">While academics and Twitter users have begun to use the term, only 2% of the U.S. population actually identifies with this word. </a> Latinx has become so widely used that Elizabeth Warren has taken to using it on the campaign trail.  This has led to a reflection on its political implications in a recent Ross Douthat piece <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nyti.ms/2JSDPcK">in the <em>New York Times</em>. </a> The interesting question is why a term that is thought to help unify a large group of people would fail to gain wider traction.</p><p>Since Spanish is my mother tongue, I can understand why this term would befuddle Spanish speakers.  From a linguistic perspective, it makes no sense to create a genderless word in a gender-marked language. Yes, the -o and -a endings signal the grammatical gender, such as in the terms <em>niño and niña. </em>But the endings for the adult form are not always straightforward, such as in <em>el</em> <em>hombre </em>and <em>la</em> <em>mujer.</em> In fact, all nouns carry grammatical gender and some of these end in -o/a (i.e. <em>la tierra)</em> and others do not (i.e. <em>el arbol</em>)<em>.</em> Finally, even within categories that have similar meanings there can be variation. In Spanish, it’s <em>el puma </em>and<em> la pantera. </em>But in Italian, one would say <em>la tigre. </em>Confused yet? Grammatical gender is confusing, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://lightonspanish.com/the-gender-of-animals-in-spanish/">especially with regard to animals.</a></p><p>With all this confusion, Spanish speakers lose a connection between sex and gender. No one would be insulted if they are considered part of <em>el pueblo Latino </em>or <em>la gente Latina. </em>Just because someone says I am part of <em>la gente Latina</em> doesn’t make me feel that they are referring only to women. For a speaker of this class of Romance languages, the notion that gender and sex are the same thing makes little sense. Yes, gender originates in sex but it is not the same thing when it comes to non-sexed nouns.</p><p>The problem arises when we use a gender-marked Romance language term in English contexts. For example, one day I ran across a cover for <em>Newsweek</em> that characterizes Selena as “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onnewsstandsnow.com/collections/newsweek/products/newsweek-selena-the-life-and-legacy-of-tejanos-queen?variant=7841788788789">Tejano’s Queen</a>.” I was confused by this. Did they mean <em>Tejano’s</em> (i.e. people from Texas) music?  The word music was never used so I kept on reading.  I found that the special issue was “proud to present Selena, a 100-page tribute to the most beloved Tejano singer of all time.” Oh, so she was a Tejano singer and the reference was to music.  But, in fact, she would be <em>una cantante de musica<strong>Tejana</strong> </em>or <em>una cantante <strong>Tejana</strong></em>. Either way, the gender would be feminine not masculine. <em>Tejana</em> and <em>Tejano </em>had been masculinized to the latter. This is not unusual for Anglophones. You might remember the once Terminator, and now ex-Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger stating “No problemo.” The problem (no pun intended) is that it should be <em>No hay problema.</em> Again, an Anglophone (probably the scriptwriters) masculinizes a Spanish noun. Spanish has two genders but for some reason Anglophones think there is only one. Thus, what grammatical gender is and is not becomes entirely lost when moving to a language where gender and sex are the same thing.</p><p>But let’s leave my linguistic perch for a second and think about the implications of the term <em>X </em>is. The term <em>X</em> is sought as one that would be all inclusive. The term reminds me of algebra where <em>X</em> represents a variable that has no defined meaning.  As such it is perfectly suited for equations where a term is unknown.  In this case, it can take on any value and in human terms would represent a more inclusive term.</p><p>The problem with creating a new genderless word, is that it already exists in gender-marked languages that have a true neuter. There are two languages that come to mind when thinking about the lexical origins of English. One is German and the other is Latin. Of these two languages, Latin has the perfect solution. Not only does it contain a neuter but it also has a plural neuter, <em>Latinae.</em> Rather than using a synthetically and anglophonically derived ending such as <em>X</em>, we could opt for a more organic one that has its roots in the language that has influenced speakers across the planet. In that sense, <em>Latinae</em> is all-inclusive and derives from a language that sought to create a genderless ending system. Latin is the natural language of science and the one used to represent complex concepts in English. <em>Latinae </em>gets rid of a sex and gender bias, it is inclusive, and was actually used for that reason. Let’s go with a genderless solution from a gender-marked language.</p><p>If you miss the <em>X</em>, you could tune in for reruns of <em>The X-Files</em>. Here, you would be presented with the motto “The truth is out there,” which also applies to our search for a genderless all-inclusive term <em>Latinae</em> to replace <em>Latino/a/x.</em><em>Verum illic</em>, the truth is out there.</p><blockquote><p><em>Editor’s Note: An updated version of this article addresses the error where the author incorrectly states that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/">Please read the updated article here.</a> We regret the error.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Feature image credit:”Spanish dictionary” by Abigail Luke via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/185598731@N04/49090327886/in/dateposted-public/">Flickr </a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/">The truth about ‘Latinx’</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/609393366/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/609393366/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/" rel="nofollow">The truth about ‘Latinx’ [a revision]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/etymology-and-delusion-part-2/" rel="nofollow">Etymology and delusion, part 2</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/etymology-and-delusion-part-1/" rel="nofollow">Etymology and delusion, Part 1</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Could greater empathy help heal our current political divisions?</strong> Not according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/empathy-is-tearing-us-apart/">this <em>Wired</em> article</a> by Robert Wright. Researchers have found that more empathy for an “in group” may actually relate to greater hostility towards the “out group”. People with higher levels of empathy were more likely to be support no-platforming a speaker from an opposing party, for instance, and even showed more amusement when they read that a bystander in favour of that speaker had been hurt.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Guardian’s</em> “Science Weekly” podcast <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/nov/08/taking-on-eysenck-one-mans-mission-to-challenge-a-giant-of-psychology-science-weekly-podcast">focuses on the controversy surrounding work by Hans Eysenck</a>, which purported to find strong links between personality and cancer risk</strong>.

<p><strong>A <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/it-is-okay-to-lose-confidence-in-your-previous-research">story by Dalmeet Singh Chawla</a> in <em>Nature Index </em>highlights recent research from the “Loss of Confidence Project”, which aims to encourage scientists to declare when they’ve lost confidence in their past findings</strong>. Half of respondents to an online survey said they’d lost confidence in some of their previous results, due to a combination of mistakes, misjudgements, and questionable research practices. However, less than 20% had publicly reported these doubts.</p>

<p><strong>The latest trend to sweep Silicon Valley is so-called “dopamine fasting,” in which people abstain from pleasurable or stimulating experiences for a period of time</strong>. Is it perhaps just a fancy way of saying “taking a break”, couched in some pseudo-neuroscientific language? <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/13/20959424/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-trend-neuroscience">Sigal Samuel has the answers</a> at <em>Vox</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Social media has changed the way we interact and communicate with each other — and in doing so, has threatened democracy as we know it</strong>. That’s the argument of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/">feature in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> by Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell, which touches on some of the same issues we’ve explored here at <em>Research Digest</em> this week, such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/">outrage</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/14/psychological-study-of-moral-grandstanding-helps-explain-why-social-media-is-so-toxic/">moral grandstanding</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pigs can now be added to the elite group of animals that are able to use tools</strong>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/add-another-animal-to-the-list-of-tool-users-pigs/">reports Karinna Hurley</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. Researchers at a zoo in Paris observed a Visayan warty pig called Priscilla using bits of bark to help dig out a nest. Other pigs even seemed to have learned the skill from her, they found.

<p><strong>And finally, we recently reported on a study <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/15/the-stereotype-of-the-narcissistic-only-child-is-widespread-but-its-wrong/">debunking the myth</a> of the narcissistic only child — but there are also</strong><strong> other incorrect stereotypes that only children face. </strong><span>At </span><em>The Conversation</em><span>, Ana Aznar </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/myths-about-only-children-debunked-126127">points out</a><span> that whether or not we have siblings makes very little difference to our personality, social skills or mental health.</span></p>

<p>What is it about social media that makes discussions about controversial topics so caustic and unpleasant? A variety of reasons have been put forward — such as the tendency for outrage to self-perpetuate, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/">we reported earlier this week</a>. But now a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223749">new study</a>, published in <em>PLoS One</em>, implicates a concept so far explored in philosophy rather than psychology. This is “moral grandstanding” — publicly opining on morality and politics to impress others, and so to seek social status.</p>
<p><span id="more-38492"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">To engage in moral grandstanding, it’s the motivation behind the comments or statements that really matters: the individual is seeking to gain status, rather than simply to express their sincerely-held beliefs. Moral grandstanding can take many forms, the researchers write: “in a quest to impress peers, someone may trump up moral charges, pile on in cases of public shaming, announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong, or exaggerate emotional displays in taking ideological positions.” They may also ramp up the situation, seeking to out-do others in their outrage. This concern with increasing one’s influence, rank or social status is, of course, a common characteristic of discourse on social media.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Given its relationship with status-seeking, Joshua Grubbs at Bowling Green State University and colleagues figured that moral grandstanding should also be amenable to examination as a psychological phenomenon. They hypothesised that it would be characterised by strivings for dominance or prestige, and may be associated with personality traits related to status-seeking, such as narcissism.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The team first designed a questionnaire to assess dominance- and prestige-seeking as sub-scales of “moral grandstanding motivations”. The ultimate short-form, 10-item scale asks participants the extent to which they agree or disagree (on a 7-point scale) with statements including “My moral/political beliefs should be inspiring to others” (relating to prestige) and “I share my moral/political beliefs to make people who disagree with me feel bad” (relating to dominance).</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the first three studies — two on groups of students, and one on a nationally representative group of more than 1,000 US participants — the team administered their scale, plus a battery of other tests, including personality tests, questions about political affiliation and measures of the participants’ experience of political or moral conflict (whether — and how often — they’d experienced conflict in the home or got into fights on social media, for example, because of their political and moral beliefs).</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">They found consistent results. Higher scores on prestige-seeking were associated with narcissistic extraversion and extraversion more generally, while the dominance aspects were strongly associated with narcissistic antagonism (a willingness to exploit others for personal gains), and related to lower conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Political ideology had no relationship with moral grandstanding scores. But higher scores on both sub-scales did correlate with greater reported conflict with people holding different political and moral views (and this wasn’t simply because of differences in participants’ personality traits).</span></span></p>
<p>A further, month-long study provided preliminary evidence that individual differences in moral grandstanding are relatively stable over time. In this study, the team also found evidence that while dominance-related motivations predicted conflict with people with differing views on political and moral issues, prestige-seekers reported growing closer to other people with the same views.</p>
<p>A final study of 1,776 US adults revealed that both prestige- and dominance-strivings were associated with more self-reported social media behaviours consistent with grandstanding — re-posting something that a participant disagreed with to make fun of it, or reposting something that they agreed with to make themselves look good, for example.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“Collectively, these findings provide support for an account of moral grandstanding that conceptualises it as a status-seeking behaviour that is driven by status-seeking motives,” and that could explain some of the problems with social discourse, especially on social media, the team writes.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers do acknowledge limitations to their study. It relied on self-reports of conflicts and social media behaviour, for example. More work should now be done to build on the preliminary evidence, they argue, in part because of the urgent need to understand the potential real-world implications. </span></span><span>“The long-term implications of grandstanding are not yet known,” they write, “though, should philosophical speculation hold true, it is likely that this phenomenon is associated with polarisation and break-downs in effective communication, particularly with outgroup members or in-group members whom one perceives as a rival.”</span></p>
