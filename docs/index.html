              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closest-known-black-hole-to-earth">Astronomers have found the closest known black hole to Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>The closest black hole yet found is just 1,560 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. The black hole, dubbed Gaia BH1, is about 10 times the mass of the sun and orbits a sunlike star.</p>



<p>Most known black holes steal and eat gas from massive companion stars. That gas forms a disk around the black hole and glows brightly in X-rays. But hungry black holes are not the most common ones in our galaxy. Far more numerous are the tranquil black holes that are not mid-meal, which astronomers have dreamed of finding for decades. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-closest-earth-may-have-been-spotted">Previous claims</a> of finding such black holes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-nearest-black-hole-star-system-binary-space">have so far not held up</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/20; SN: 3/11/22</em>).</p>





<p>So astrophysicist Kareem El-Badry and colleagues turned to newly released data from the Gaia spacecraft, which precisely maps the positions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">billions of stars</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/22</em>). A star orbiting a black hole at a safe distance won’t get eaten, but it will be pulled back and forth by the black hole’s gravity. Astronomers can detect the star’s motion and deduce the black hole’s presence.</p>



<p>Out of hundreds of thousands of stars that looked like they were tugged by an unseen object, just one seemed like a good black hole candidate. Follow-up observations with other telescopes <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac3140/6794289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support the black hole idea</a>, the team reports November 2 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>Gaia BH1 is the nearest black hole to Earth ever discovered — the next closest is around 3,200 light-years away. But it’s probably not the closest that exists, or even the closest we’ll ever find. Astronomers think there are about 100 million black holes in the Milky Way, but almost all of them are invisible. “They’re just isolated, so we can’t see them,” says El-Badry, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>The next data release from Gaia is due out in 2025, and El-Badry expects it to bring more black hole bounty. “We think there are probably a lot that are closer,” he says. “Just finding one … suggests there are a bunch more to be found.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-allergies-asthma-therapy-allergy-shots">Cat allergies may be tamed by adding an asthma therapy to allergy shots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adding lab-made antibodies to allergy shots may better groom the immune system against cat allergies than standard shots alone. The combination therapy also reduced allergy symptoms for a year after stopping treatment, a new study finds</p>



<p>Allergy shots, also called immunotherapy, have been used for more than a century to reduce the itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose, congestion and other symptoms of allergies. The shots contain tiny amounts of the things people are allergic to, called allergens. People get shots weekly to monthly for three to five years and gradually build up tolerance to the allergen. </p>





<p>Despite their long use, scientists don’t know exactly how allergy shots work, says Lisa Wheatley, an allergist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some people are essentially cured of their allergies, while others may need shots indefinitely. “We knew that if you were on immunotherapy for cat [allergies] … you will be better after that year, but you will not retain that benefit.”</p>



<p>The study was done to see if researchers could improve allergy therapy by reducing the amount of time shots were needed while still giving patients long-lasting relief. &nbsp;The team also hoped to better understand how immunotherapy works, she says.</p>



<p>When allergies strike, some immune cells produce alarm chemicals that trigger inflammation and other symptoms. “If we could dampen the signaling that says ‘danger,’ we could maybe improve immunotherapy,” Wheatley says.</p>



<p>She and colleagues used a monoclonal antibody called tezepelumab to block one of those alarm chemicals, known as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or TSLP. The antibody has been used as an asthma treatment, so researchers already knew it is generally safe.</p>



<p>Researchers gave 121 cat allergy sufferers either standard allergy shots alone, tezepelumab alone, a combination of the two or a placebo. On its own, tezepelumab was no better than just a placebo, the researchers found.</p>



<p>After a year of treatment, people who got the combo had <a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01333-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced allergy symptoms</a> to cat dander squirted up their noses compared with people who got standard shots, researchers report October 9 in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>.</p>



<p>And levels of allergy-triggering antibodies called IgE fell and kept falling even a year after treatment stopped in people who got the combination. In people on standard shots, IgE levels started to claw their way back to baseline once treatment stopped, Wheatley says.</p>



<p>One reason the therapy may work is that it alters inflammation-triggering gene activity in some immune cells, the team found. Immune cells called mast cells made less tryptase — one of the major chemicals released in an allergic reaction — in people who got the combination therapy, an analysis of nasal swabs showed.</p>



<p>While the results are encouraging, it’s not clear that tezepelumab would work as well for other allergies, says Edward Zoratti, an allergist and immunologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who was not involved in the study. “Did they just get lucky and choose the right allergen?”</p>



<p>Cat allergies develop against a single sticky protein called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-work-tame-cat-allergies-crispr-vaccine-food-therapy">Fel d1 that is in cats’ saliva</a> and in flakes of dead skin cells, or dander (<em>SN: 2/13/20</em>). Cockroach allergies, in contrast, can be produced by a variety of proteins.</p>



<p>Another possible drawback is that monoclonal antibodies are expensive, Zoratti says.</p>



<p>Much more research is needed before this or any other therapy is added to allergy shots in a doctor’s office, he says, but the study is important for understanding how allergy therapies work. “It’s one step in a long chain that will probably lead us to a really useful therapy in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alcohol-death-rate-rise-united-states-pandemic">The U.S.’s alcohol-induced death rate rose sharply in the pandemic’s first year</a></h4>

              
                <p>The death rate from alcohol use rose sharply in the United States in the first year of the pandemic. From 2019 to 2020, the rate of alcohol-induced deaths <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/%20cdc:121795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbed 26 percent</a>, from 10.4 per 100,000 people to 13.1 per 100,000, researchers report in a National Center for Health Statistics data brief published November 4.</p>



<p>The rate of alcohol-induced deaths has generally increased yearly for the last two decades, but the annual uptick tended to be 7 percent or less.</p>





<p>Deaths from alcoholic liver disease, which includes hepatitis and cirrhosis, were the most common driver of the increased rate. Deaths from mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol use — mortality from dependence syndrome or withdrawal, for example — were the second most frequent contributor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Steep step-up</h3>



<p>The death rate from alcohol use jumped 26 percent overall from 2019 to 2020, a marked increase from previous years.</p>

<p>Other researchers have reported that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adults were drinking more frequently, and more heavily</a>, early in the pandemic compared with the year before.</p>



<p>There is also evidence of an increase in cases of alcoholic liver disease. A study at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore reported that 2.3 times as many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8919405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients with severe alcoholic liver disease and with recent unhealthy drinking</a> were referred to their liver transplant center from July to December of 2020 compared with those months in 2019.</p>





<p>The jump in the alcohol-induced death rate isn’t surprising, considering how much data “had been pointing in this direction,” says transplant hepatologist Victor Chen of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>The liver can regenerate, but only up to a point, Chen says. Once the liver is permanently damaged with scar tissue, the recommendation is to stop drinking alcohol to prevent more harm. The combination of underlying liver disease and more drinking can “cause liver symptoms, and ultimately death, if you don’t get a transplant early enough.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/11/03/how-do-science-startups-actually-work/">How science startups actually work</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s tough being an academic these days. Between the tiny number of permanent positions and the systemic exploitation of cheap labour, people are looking for a way out. Students, postdocs, and even PIs are asking themselves: should I join a startup? Should I make my own startup? It sounds seductive—change the world! Make money! Keep doing research, but in a less toxic environment! Who wouldn’t want to jump in at the chance of working on something innovative and useful?</p>



<p>People often ask me about my thoughts on industry: after my PhD and postdoc, I’ve worked in industrial R&amp;D at big tech companies [Meta, Google], I’ve founded a medtech startup, I run a consulting business [<a href="https://xcorr.dev">xcorr.dev</a>], I advise and have equity in early-stage startups [<a href="https://www.artificio.org/">Artificio</a>], I was the founding CTO for an education non-profit [<a href="https://neuromatch.io">Neuromatch</a>]. Having experienced all these things, I want to take a step back to write this long note, so that you may learn from my tribulations.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of misleading information out there in the popular media: startups are depicted as exciting places where innovative research takes place outside the constraints of academia. I want to reset expectations and in particular explain how money flows in a startup. Startups lose money, at least for a while, and if they don’t figure out how to make money soon enough, they will go broke. Most PhD students &amp; many postdocs are isolated from the $ and ¢ aspects of running a lab, and academics sometimes express disdain at commercialism. However, for-profit startups, are, well, <em>for-profit</em>, and they need cash to keep going. If startup life appeals to you, you need to understand the money flow.</p>



<p>This is particularly important to understand the role of research in a startup. You may ask yourself: will I be able to do research if I join startup X? The answer is: <em>it depends</em>. I end with a checklist of things you might want to consider before you decide to dedicate multiple years of your life to a startup.</p>

<h1>What’s a startup anyway?</h1>



<p>A startup is a newly existing business that seeks to scale a given business model. For example, let’s say you have an idea for a new widget and you do market research to show people will buy said widgets. You may then convince investors to give you money to create a widget factory and start selling widgets. Congratulations! You have a startup.</p>

<p>Startups often start by losing money on salaries, capital expenditures (i.e. stuff like servers, factories, and so forth), lawyer fees, etc. This is known as the <em>valley of death</em>. Many startups are <em>default-dead</em>: to continue operating, they have to replenish their coffers with a constant influx of capital from external sources. These investments are conventionally structured in rounds, occurring every 12-18 months, starting with a pre-seed round, then going on to a seed round. Starting from series A onwards, startups often display revenue, though not enough to fund their massive expansion. Scaling is often necessary to make a startup ultimately profitable–a widget factory might cost the same regardless of whether it produces 1,000 widgets or a million. Therefore, by selling lots and lots of widgets, you spread the fixed cost of the widget factory over many widgets.</p>

<p>Startups’ long-term trajectory can be one of:</p>



<ul>
<li>run out of money and close down</li>



<li>get acquired</li>



<li>become public companies</li>



<li>remain private for a long time, for various strategic reasons</li>
</ul>



<p>To raise money, they sell off chunks of themselves to investors. Doing so dilutes the ownership of the original owners. Instead of owning 100% of my business, if I sell off 20% for a chunk of change (say, 200k$), then my business is valued 1M$ and I own 80% of it. Dilutive funding is often offered by venture capitalists (VC). Non-dilutive funding, which doesn’t cost any ownership, is done by government orgs (e.g. the NSF, various agencies in Canada, etc.).</p>

<p>Importantly, most startups don’t succeed – the general rule of thumb is that out 10 startups that receive seed investment, 7 will close down, 2 will break even, and only 1 will see a significant return on investment to the investor.</p>



<h1>What determines a startup’s value?</h1>



<p>Startups survive by selling chunks of themselves to investors. How do you value a chunk of a startup?</p>



<p>If I try to buy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">poutine stand down the street</a> to become a restaurateur, there’s a few well-established ways to price that: I might look at the price of poutines they sell a year (gross income), or their net income, that is, poutine sales minus salaries minus other expenditures. Then I could apply a multiplier to get a ballpark valuation number. If the industry-wide revenue multiple for an independent restaurant is .3, and they’re selling 300k$ worth of poutine a year, a smooth 45k$ might get me into the restaurant business.</p>



<p>But multipliers don’t work if a startup is making no money! You might be asking: how can you ask people for money to own something that makes no money? How is it that the poutine stand down the street—bringing real value to the people in the form of delicious carbs—can be bought for less than the price of a Tesla, while a guy with a half-baked idea and no sales can value his startup at 3M$?</p>



<p>One method to value a startup is <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=6515">the so-called VC method</a>. It states that the value of a startup is some discount factor for risk times the expected value of the business at some time in the future (say, 5 years). Let’s look at each of these in turn.</p>



<ul>
<li>Discount factor for risk: If I’m willing to take no risk at all, I can put money in high-savings rate account and make about 3% per year in these days of high interest rates. Free money! If I can afford a little risk, I can put money in an index fund and make an average of 8% a year, with some variance. Higher risk tolerance is rewarded with higher average returns. When an investor puts money in a startup, with a &gt;50% risk of losing all of it, they will require much higher multipliers for it to be worth it—perhaps on the order of 50% year-on-year. The total discount factor is equal to (1+d)^-X, where X is the number of years at maturity (say, X = 5)</li>



<li>Future value of the business: that can be estimated using the same type of calculation used to estimate the value of a poutine stand. Tech businesses have much higher multipliers (aka price-to-earnings) than brick-and-mortar independent restaurants: the industry average is 20. Thus, if your business could be making 10M$ in annual sales in 5 years, according to this calculation, it would be worth 200M$.</li>
</ul>



<p>I like to think about the discount factor in a slightly different way: I like to think about it in terms of p(things will work in X years). Hence, the value is:</p>

<p>Note: this is a highly simplified model, and doesn’t take into account that you may have several sales scenarios, each weighted by their likelihood, etc. The lessons are broadly the same regardless of your exact valuation model.</p>



<p>Generally, you’ll want each successive funding round to be at a valuation of 2–3X higher than the last one, otherwise you will quickly dilute yourself out of a business. Investors also hate so-called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downround.asp">down rounds</a>, where the startup is valued less than previously, because that means that they overpaid for their investment. Sometimes a miracle happens and you discover more yearly sales—equivalently, a larger total addressable market—prior to starting to sell things, but that is a very rare occurrence indeed. That means that the only thing you can really work on to increase the value of your startup and survive to live another day is to make your product or business “more certain to work” by a factor of 2–3X every 18–24 months. In other words: you should work to decrease risk.</p>



<h1>What kinds of risks do startups face?</h1>



<p>So far we’ve established that decreasing risk is a key activity in a startup. What kinds of risk are we talking about anyway?</p>



<h2>Market risks</h2>



<p>Will people want to buy the thing you’re selling at a price that will ultimately make you a profit? Generally, investors don’t like to invest in widget businesses where it’s not very clear whether anybody will buy the widget. You can address market risk by:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Showing that you already have sales</em>. Definitely the best. If you have 100 clients willing to buy a thing at a decent price and you’re growing year-on-year by 10X, then it won’t be too hard for an investor to believe you have a viable business.</li>



<li><em>Showing that people are using the thing and they like it</em>. Maybe you haven’t figured out how to sell a widget, but you might be able to show that people use a free, minimalistic version of a thing (MVP) and love it. That can mean having alpha users or demo installs.</li>



<li><em>Showing that people will actually buy the thing once it’s made</em>. That can mean getting a letter-of-intent from some big client saying they’ll buy the widget once it’s made.</li>
</ul>



<p>In all these cases, you need to build things. It’s hard to get a letter of intent for something you can’t hold in your hand in a prototypical manner. To decrease market risk, you have to build a prototype and then a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>



<h2>Technological risk</h2>



<p>Perhaps the product you are building is based on a principle that has been demonstrated only on a small scale in a lab, or maybe even just on paper. The usual scale to establish the technological maturity of an idea is TRL (technological readiness level). It comes from NASA’s classification system to judge prospective technologies for use in space, but it’s been broadly adopted in early stage R&amp;D. The higher the TRL, the lower the risk.</p>

From Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Early-stage, pre-revenue startups will need very deep pockets to work on ideas at TRL1—TRL2. That really only makes sense if the market is so obviously large (”blockbuster”) that the risk and time expense can make sense. Maybe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/google-chevron-invest-in-fusion-startup-tae-technologies.html">somebody will fund a TRL1 nuclear fusion startup</a>, because clean energy at scale is such a large market. Otherwise, TRL1—2 is usually done at research institutions with public money, with the outcome, knowledge, becoming a public good. Early-stage deep-tech startups typically focus on TRL3—6 instead.</p>



<p>Building an MVP can really decrease technological risk because it shows the thing actually exists. Generally it’s a bad idea to combine something that has high technological risk with high market risk. A better combo might be: show that something has a big, obvious addressable market if only this very difficult technological/science problem can be overcome by the world’s foremost expert in this area, who happens to be you. Or maybe you have already built a super special, super cool technology and you think, I think maybe somebody would buy this, but you need to do market research.</p>



<p><em>Aside &amp; rant</em>: it can be a pointless exercise to try to forecast how basic research ideas done at research institutions will translate into tangible, marketable goods, because there are so many steps between the research and its commercialization. That means that judging basic research based on commercialization potential (as funding agencies increasingly do) can be an exercise in futility. Fundamental research is better judged by criteria such as: is this interesting?</p>



<h2>Regulatory and IP risk</h2>



<p>If you do anything medical, much of the uncertainty will be regulatory. Is your medical device class II or class III? The burden of proof and the cost of trials in each case will be different. Do you have access to the necessary intellectual property (IP)? Can you protect yourself long enough to go to market without somebody doing the thing you were planning to do eating your lunch?</p>



<h2>Execution risk</h2>



<p>Sometimes all the stars are aligned: the market is there, the innovation works, you’re lawyered up, but you still fail to deliver a good product. Maybe you don’t hire the right people; people who are too research-y or insist on putting things which don’t work yet into production. You get into constant fights about priorities and every planning meeting is a mutiny. You get a lawsuit at an inopportune time. Many factors can converge to cause a good idea with a demonstrated market to fail if not executed properly.</p>



<h1>If it’s too good to be true, it probably is</h1>



<p>We hear a lot about “research-labs”-like startups that don’t have any visible products and that seem to be doing great. This sets a really bad precedent for students and postdocs, because it gives the impression that there’s some free money floating out there. <strong>If it looks too good to be true, it probably is</strong>.</p>



<p>We don’t hear so much about startups that fail, because dead men tell no tales: it’s similar to the file drawer problem in academia. We often hear of successful AI startups, but we seldom hear about the cautionary tale of ElementAI. ElementAI was a startup originated from Yoshua Bengio, Turing-award winning AI researcher. They used up a lot of money to bring AI-based solutions to businesses, but grew too fast without a laser-tight focus on a single, scaleable product that could be sold. The fact that it was started by somebody famous is completely irrelevant: it may have hurt them, because they were able to raise money too fast to get their feet solid and prove a product-market fit. At some point, the startup has to sell a product for more than the cost of the inputs to the product. In this case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_AI">they were sold for scraps</a>, employee stock became worthless, and many wasted years of their lives in the debacle.</p>



<p>Understand the hypothesis underlying what a startup is doing and the addressable market. If it makes sense, jump in. If you cannot make the numbers add up and the people in the startup can’t give you a good story, you need to get out of there. I’ve heard students and postdocs tell me that they’re skeptical of startup X but want to jump in anyway, because, hey, what do they know? If you’re a <em>subject domain expert</em>, you often know more about the technology being developed and its risk profile than 90% of people involved. You should combine your pre-existing technical knowledge with knowledge about the market, which can be acquired pretty fast. If you do this, you can invest your time and energy on what you sincerely believe is a winner rather than engage in magical thinking.</p>



<h1>What can you do as a PhD to help your startup succeed?</h1>



<p>Now we get to the crux of my argument: your job, as a PhD in an early-stage startup, is to reduce risk. You have several ways of doing this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Helping to build an MVP or prototype</li>



<li>Talking to people who will use the product to make it better (needs-driven design)</li>



<li>Do research showing the efficacy of the product for its intended purpose</li>
</ul>



<p>On this last point, you might think that industrial research is less reliable (sloppier) than academic research: if you have financial incentives to show something is true, wouldn’t you want to show that it’s true? In fact, you have every incentive for the research to be correct – not as in “finding the answer management wants to be true”, but as in “finding the right answer”. Finding the right answer decreases the inherent risk in the venture, which means you’re likely to survive another day: if the hypothesis underlying the startup is wrong, you should pivot now rather than later when you’ve burned through your cashflow.</p>



<p>Because a pre-revenue startup has so much uncertainty and doesn’t have the cash flow to cushion the blows, you should be working on <strong>little R research</strong>. I would also argue that you should deeply understand the market at this point, and avoid doing R&amp;D fenced off from the business: your research needs to translate pretty quick into things people can buy, ideally within one round of financing (18–24 months).</p>



<h2>Papers, what are they good for?</h2>



<p>Publishing papers in this environment is a mixed bag. Positive incentives to publish include:</p>



<ul>
<li>researchers want papers, and keeping high-value researchers happy is often a primary incentive for the startup, as employee churn is expensive.</li>



<li>the research itself can bring value to the company by decreasing uncertainty and reorienting activities depending on findings.</li>



<li>the seal of approval from peer-reviewed research can reassure investors the work is innovative in ways and uncertainty has been decreased. Be careful though, ultimately, it’s not hard for an investor to find an expert senior postdoc and give them several hundreds of dollars to thoroughly review your claims. That due diligence is any many ways far more extensive than peer review ever could be.</li>



<li>recruiting high-value researchers can become easier if they have visibility into the research the company does. That’s also one reason many startups have company blogs.</li>



<li>research may be required to pass regulatory hurdles, for example with medical devices.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, there are many downsides:</p>



<ul>
<li>papers don’t pay the bills: clients do. Papers can be a huge distraction and encourage scientists to isolate themselves from the business and not contribute to product early on.</li>



<li>research creates intellectual property, which brings value to the company; but publishing that IP prevents patenting. It allows competitors to copy the innovation.</li>
</ul>



<p>In conclusion: an early-stage startup that doesn’t seem to have many clients but has a lot of papers coming out is usually a warning sign. As a large shareholder in a startup, or an early employee in charge of R&amp;D, you have to make sure you do the right kinds of research, and create a culture that incentivizes the continued existence of said startup.</p>



<p>Later-stage startups and companies with mature cashflows are in a better position to engage in big R research. Even then, however, the goal is rarely the production of knowledge, understood as a public good–though on occasion good PR could be valuable for secondary purposes like recruiting. The purpose instead is to perform research in such a way that ultimately feed into new products down the line that translate into sizeable revenue. Companies with long runways–for instance Meta with its Metaverse strategy–can afford to use a very long horizon to evaluate research. However, that’s only viable because Meta has tens of billions of dollars in cash reserves AND a positive cashflow. Most startups and companies are not in that case.</p>



<h1>How not to succeed as a startup</h1>



<p>You can learn from my mistakes. I was briefly the CTO of a medtech startup that used AI to treat a given neurological condition. As a PhD, it was my job to decrease the uncertainty surrounding the startup rapidly for us to raise money. I did all the activities expected of that role: created valuable IP that could be protected, did studies demonstrating our proof-of-concept, participated in product development, etc.</p>



<p>However, in doing so, I isolated myself from the marketing and fundraising aspects of the startups. What I should have focused more on was validating the market. Digging deeper and deeper, we realized that the market we had hoped for was smaller than anticipated as we uncovered a number of contraindications for the treatment we were building. To address a larger market through a different indication would have increased the uncertainty about efficacy to an unacceptable level. Ultimately, without a sizeable market, the opportunity was dead in the water. Although we could have continued to grind things out for a number of years, because the market opportunity was so small, it seemed a better trade-off to shut things down. A couple of papers and a patent are simply pointless for a startup unless you can turn that R&amp;D into something that can ultimately be sold.</p>



<h1>What about my favourite R&amp;D startup?</h1>



<p>I’ve shared my thoughts on the role of research in a for-profit startup with many over the years. I inevitably get pushback, often in the form of “what about startup X? It looks like they’re just doing R&amp;D and doing fine?” Let’s deconstruct some counterexamples that people frequently cite.</p>



<p>Disclaimer: although I worked at Facebook and Google, I don’t have any special insight about these startups that were ultimately acquired by Facebook and Google, I’m just reading the publicly available information.</p>



<h2>Deepmind</h2>



<p>Deepmind, the artificial-general-intelligence company, is an interesting case. It was acquired in 2014 by Google at a reported 600M$. At the time, they had about 75 employees. For a company that had no visible product, its exit paths were rather narrow: an early investor confided that had they not been acquired by Google, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/deepmind-would-have-probably-failed-without-google-says-investor.html">they would have probably failed</a>. About 8M$ per employee is pretty expensive for an acquihire, but if you look at contemporary discussions on HackerNews, commenters <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7127938">speculate that the core value of the company was indeed its people</a>: recruit AI researchers cheaply in Europe, repackage as a functioning R&amp;D team that could be sold to a tech giant. That would make Deepmind prior to its acquisition, in essence, a recruiter specialized in AI talent.</p>



<p>Compared to other acquisitions around the same time, it was cheap: WhatsApp was acquired the same year for 19B$, with 55 employees at the time, that would come with about 40X the price per employee. I don’t want to imply that Deepmind’s sale to Google was a firesale. However, in my mind, its sale was not the roaring success that some claim it was. Deepmind’s path was quite narrow, and I don’t think it’s replicable today.</p>



<h2>Ctrl-Labs</h2>



<p>Ctrl-Labs built neural interfaces for AR/VR. They assembled an R&amp;D team to create a neural interface that detect the smallest of neural impulse close to the wrist and translate that into commands to a computer. At the time of acquisition, they were–to the best of my ability to search through the internet wayback machine–a pretty small team, perhaps on the order of a dozen people. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/facebook-acquires-ctrl-labs-to-advance-its-brain-machine-interface-efforts/#:~:text=And%20we%20want%20to%20build,it%20into%20consumer%20products%20faster.%E2%80%9D">They were acquired by Facebook in 2019 for a reported 500M$-1B$</a>. Importantly, however, they had real protected intellectual property – <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=thomas+reardon&amp;oq=thomas+reardon">a portfolio of their own patents</a> plus <a href="https://betakit.com/ctrl-labs-acquires-norths-patents-for-myo-armband-technology/">IP acquired from North</a> (previously named Myo). Their R&amp;D had been translated to a real prototype, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GtRhy1maxc">which they presented at conferences</a>. They had a real use case, which is interfacing for AR/VR. In other words, they had removed much of the technical uncertainty around the technology, in precisely the way I’m advocating here. In my view, it’s a good example of the role of R&amp;D is in an early stage startup.</p>



<h2>FROs &amp; OpenAI</h2>



<p>So far our discussion has been focused on for-profit startups, which are by the far the most common legal structure for what we call “startups”, and which have the constraints that I discussed previously. People are actively looking for different legal structures that allow them to do big-R research outside the confines of academia.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5">Focused Research Organizations (FROs) are a new kind of model that’s emerging that’s potentially very exciting</a>. They focus on building one highly specific public good (e.g. a tool, a dataset) that they can deliver within a time frame of ~5 years. Importantly, most FROs are non-profit organizations, and funders understand that the effort is oriented towards this specific outcome without the expectation of profit. They’re very much an experiment at this point, but it will be interesting to see what comes out them.</p>



<p>Another example of an alternative model is OpenAI. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/">OpenAI</a> was started as a non-profit with a billion dollars in funding, and received a further injection of 1B$ from Microsoft following its re-incorporation as a limited-profit company. Much of their research is done out in the open (although GPT-3 and DALL-E2 checkpoints have not been released). Notice, however, that despite its legal status, OpenAI does have revenue through GPT-3. Indeed, non-profits or limited-profits still need to have a valid business model or constant cash influx to continue operating.</p>



<p>Perhaps a specific FRO’s cash flow looks like “we have exactly 30M$ from a donor to create a new tool, then we will release the tool and then shut down”. As long as everybody knows what they’re getting into, I applaud these efforts at finding alternatives. However, for startups incorporated as for-profits, which is the vast majority of startups, doing blue-sky research un-anchored to a product is a sure-fire recipe to run out of cash.</p>



<h1>A checklist for joining a startup</h1>



<p>If you’re thinking of joining a startup, ask yourselves these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is the thing the startup working on necessary? Does anybody actually care?</li>



<li>Is this a cool, innovative product?</li>



<li>Do I think it’s doable, technically?</li>



<li>Do I think that people are going to buy the thing the startup sells?</li>



<li>Will I have the agency to positively affect the course of the startup?</li>



<li>How much can I grow as a scientist/programmer/data scientist within the group?</li>



<li>What do I think about the people that run this startup? Do they know what they’re doing? If it’s their first time, are they getting the mentorship they need?</li>



<li>Do they have money? How much? Where are they in their fundraising?</li>



<li>Will I be able to do the kinds of research I want to do? Little R research? Big R research? Product dev?</li>



<li>Are there any other red flags? Have several people asked “I don’t understand, how can they stay in business?” Is one of the founders a creep or a cult leader or has anger-management issues?</li>
</ul>



<h1>Conclusion</h1>



<p>A startup’s goal is to make money back to its investors by using a scalable business model. In an early stage startup, it is very rare that your job will be to “do research and publish papers”. Publishing papers can, in some circumstances, increase the value of the startup and keep it afloat, but much of the time it can be a distraction unless it’s aligned to business goals. Technical staff should understand these business goals and align to them. R&amp;D cannot be separated from the business until the startup is post-revenue and on more solid footing.</p>

                <p>Passive smartphone monitoring of people&rsquo;s walking activity can be used to construct population-level models of health and mortality risk, according to a recent&nbsp; <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> study. Read our summary of the findings from Bruce Schatz of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, and colleagues below or jump to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Previous studies have used measures of physical fitness, including walk tests and self-reported walk pace, to predict individual mortality risk. These metrics focus on quality rather than quantity of movement; measuring an individual&rsquo;s gait speed has become a standard practice for certain clinical settings, for example. The rise of passive smartphone activity monitoring opens the possibility for population-level analyses using similar metrics.</p>

<p><strong>Study Design and Results</strong></p>



<p>Researchers studied 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank national cohort who wore activity monitors with motion sensors for 1 week. While the wrist sensor is worn differently than how smartphone sensors are carried, their motion sensors can both be used to extract information on walking intensity from short bursts of walking&mdash;a daily living version of a walk test.</p>



<p>The team was able to successfully validate predictive models of mortality risk using only 6 minutes per day of steady walking collected by the sensor, combined with traditional demographic characteristics. The equivalent of gait speed calculated from this passively collected data was a predictor of 5-year mortality independent of age and sex (pooled C-index 0.72). The predictive models used only walking intensity to simulate smartphone monitors.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our results show passive measures with motion sensors can achieve similar accuracy to active measures of gait speed and walk pace,&rdquo; the authors say. &ldquo;Our scalable methods offer a feasible pathway towards national screening for health risk.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Schatz adds, &ldquo;I have spent a decade using cheap phones for clinical models of health status. These have now been tested on the largest national cohort to predict life expectancy at population scale.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crowdsource-cell-phone-data-bridges-safe">Crowdsourced cell phone data could keep bridges safe and strong</a></h4>

              
                <p>Your cell phone could reveal the health status of bridges just by being in your pocket as you go about your daily travels.</p>



<p>Accelerometers and GPS sensors that are standard components in smartphones collect information that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-022-00025-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can show how bridges flex and vibrate</a> as vehicles travel across, researchers report November 3 in <em>Communications Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>Apps that gather the measurements could keep travelers safe by alerting engineers that a bridge needs repair. The tools could also warn of, or help prevent, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bad-vibrations">catastrophic failures</a> like the tragic footbridge collapse in the western Indian state of Gujarat on October 30, or the bridge span that crumbled in Pittsburgh in January (<em>SN: 11/16/07</em>).</p>





<p>“This is really applicable to any type of bridge,” says civil engineer Thomas Matarazzo of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York. All you need, he says, is a way to get a smartphone on there — whether by car, in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-wiggle-crowds-walk-can-put-wobble-bridge">pocket of a pedestrian</a> or mounted to a scooter — and some way of monitoring the device (<em>SN: 11/10/17</em>).</p>



<p>Bridge failures, Matarazzo says, often come down to uncertainties about structural properties. “The only way to reduce those uncertainties is to monitor more frequently.” Crowdsourcing data from cell phones may be the best, and possibly only, way to get lots of data on bridges around the globe.</p>



<p>More than 600,000 bridges exist in the United States alone. Dedicated sensors that check for structural problems are expensive, Matarazzo says, so most bridges are inspected by eye, typically every other year.</p>



<p>Keeping up on bridge conditions using simple cell phone apps could make maintenance more efficient than is possible with human inspectors alone — and much cheaper than is possible with specialized sensors. The resulting improvement in care would extend the lifetimes of older bridges by a few years, Matarazzo and his colleagues estimate, but newer bridges could last nearly 15 years longer than if they weren’t monitored in this way before needing to be rebuilt or replaced.</p>



<p>To test how well cell phones could monitor bridges, Matarazzo drove over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco 102 times with cell phones in his car. He and his research team also collected data from Uber drivers during 72 trips over the suspension bridge. To check the approach on bridges more typical of the overpasses that are common on roadways, the researchers arranged for drivers to record data during 280 passes over a nearly 30-meter-long concrete bridge in Ciampino, Italy.</p>



<p>For both bridges, the cell phone sensors detected vibrations in the structures that were within a few percent of the measurements that dedicated instruments attached to the bridges could provide.</p>



<p>A single pass with a cell phone gathers as much information about a bridge as a hundred or more stationary sensors, Matarazzo says. That’s because phones can take data continuously as they cross, rather than offering data from specific locations along a bridge.</p>



<p>If the researchers manage to get transportation companies, government vehicle operators or the public to collaborate, the team could rack up much more information, leading to extremely precise measurements. Because most phones already have accelerometers and GPS, information could be collected essentially for free.</p>



<p>Cell phones could help monitor bridges that lack installed sensors, says Huili Wang, a civil engineer at the Dalian University of Technology in China who was not involved with the study. But he has doubts about the ultimate accuracy that smartphones can provide. Still, &#8220;it is a better approach for a rough estimate without [adding] more sensors,” he says.</p>



<p>Crowdsourced data probably won’t entirely replace dedicated sensors for monitoring bridges, Matarazzo agrees. But cell phones are unbeatable in a few ways, he says. “The advantage is in the convenience and the scale…. It’s a mobile-sensing system that’s already in place.”</p>



<p>Bridges are key parts of the transportation infrastructure. It’s crucial to look at changes in them that can occur in days and weeks, Matarazzo says, rather than checking on bridges every few years. “This technology enables us to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">Marsquakes hint that the planet might be volcanically active after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars might be, geologically speaking, not quite dead.</p>



<p>Researchers have analyzed a slew of recent temblors on the Red Planet and shown that these Marsquakes are probably caused by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01803-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magma moving deep under the Martian surface</a>. That’s evidence that Mars is still volcanically active, the researchers report October 27 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">touching down on Mars four years ago</a>, NASA’s InSight lander has detected more than 1,000 Marsquakes (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>). Its seismometer records seismic waves, which reveal information about a temblor’s size and location.</p>





<p>Previous studies have determined that several Marsquakes originated from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">a swath of Martian terrain known as Cerberus Fossae</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22</em>). This region, which is particularly riddled with faults, is more than 1,000 kilometers from the InSight lander.</p>



<p>But most of the Marsquakes linked to Cerberus Fossae so far have been pretty familiar, scientifically speaking, says Anna Mittelholz, a planetary scientist at Harvard University. Their seismic waves, which are low frequency, “are ones that look much more like what we see for an earthquake,” she says.</p>



<p>Mittelholz and her colleagues have now analyzed a large sample of Marsquakes, including more than 1,000 high-frequency temblors, which look nothing like their earthly brethren. To better understand the origin of the high-frequency quakes, the researchers added together their relatively weak signals. In that stack of seismic waves, the researchers saw a peak in the amount of seismic energy coming from the direction of Cerberus Fossae. That was an impressive undertaking, says Hrvoje Tkalčić, a geophysicist at the Australian National University in Canberra who was not involved with the research. “No study before this one attempted to locate the high-frequency quakes.”</p>



<p>The fact that different types of Marsquakes are all concentrated in one region is a surprise. Previous research has suggested that Marsquakes might be due to Mars’ surface cooling and shrinking over time. That process, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/apollo-era-moonquakes-reveal-moon-may-be-tectonically-active">which occurs on the moon</a>, would produce temblors evenly spread over the planet, Mittelholz says (<em>SN: 5/13/19</em>). “The expectation was that Marsquakes would originate from all over the place.&#8221;</p>



<p>And by comparing the seismic waves that InSight measured with the seismic waves produced in different regions on our own planet, the researchers further showed that the low-frequency Marsquakes are probably produced by magma moving several tens of kilometers below Mars’ surface. “Our results are much more consistent with data from volcanic regions on Earth,” Mittelholz says.</p>



<p>Rather than being a geologically dead planet, as some have suggested, Mars might be a surprisingly dynamic place, the researchers conclude. This finding rewrites our understanding of Mars, Mittelholz says, and there’s still so much more to learn about our celestial neighbor. “We’re only scratching the surface.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-clinics-map-locations-prevalence">Where are the long COVID clinics?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">For the millions of people in the United States with long COVID, getting help comes down to where they live. Long COVID clinics have been popping up, but their accessibility and the kind of care they offer vary wildly.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 Longhauler Advocacy Project, a patient support group, compiled a crowdsourced list of more than 400 long COVID clinics. The list, which the group did not vet for quality, ranges from rehabilitation or physical therapy practices to comprehensive medical centers with multiple specialists working together. <em>Science News</em> used their list plus two other patient-compiled lists, and added the 53 NIH RECOVER research sites that are studying long COVID in adults, confirming that all were active as of early October.</p>





<p>Physical therapy or rehabilitation-focused care can often help COVID-19 patients facing lingering symptoms or weakness after a long hospital stay. But people with long COVID should be wary of rehab or physical therapy practices that encourage exercise, which can lead to “crashes” rather than recovery, says Karyn Bishof, a long COVID patient and founder of the COVID-19 Longhauler Advocacy Project. Yet, in some states — Alaska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Wyoming — rehabilitation centers are patients’ only option. Overall, almost half of the clinics included on this map are physical therapy or rehabilitation centers.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that people living in big cities have the most clinics to choose from. Out of 37 clinics in New York state, all but three are in the New York City metropolitan area. California’s 29 clinics are concentrated in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. Fourteen U.S. clinics focus on children with long COVID.</p>

<p>The two maps here, noting long COVID clinic locations and long COVID prevalence by state, reveal a mismatch between need and availability of relevant medical care. In mid-September, about 1 in 5 adults in Idaho, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Wyoming who had had COVID-19 reported experiencing long COVID, defined as symptoms lasting 3 months or more for a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. North Dakota and Wyoming each have just one long COVID clinic. Idaho has three. Oklahoma has six.</p>



<p>Traveling to a faraway clinic can be hard on long COVID patients, particularly those with no partner or caregivers to help with transportation and coordinate overnight stays. Bishof recently had to drive herself to an appointment that took almost two hours of travel each way, she says. By the time she got home, she “blacked out from extreme fatigue.”</p>

<p>Many of the <a href="https://recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RECOVER</a> sites, funded by the National Institutes of Health to study long COVID, also treat adults with long COVID. But most RECOVER sites are clustered in urban areas: Out of 53 locations serving adult patients, six are in the city of Boston.</p>



<p>“It would be great if we could get medical schools to begin teaching these diseases,” says Jaime Seltzer, referring to long COVID and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS.</a> Seltzer is director of scientific and medical outreach at #MEAction, an ME/CFS advocacy group that also works with long COVID patients. The doctors most qualified to treat long COVID are those with expertise in ME/CFS and other postviral conditions that overlap with long COVID, Seltzer says. “Several studies have now shown that approximately half of people with long COVID meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.” However, there are very few of these specialists due to limited funding and attention before long COVID became the tidal wave that it is today.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>For Seltzer, clinics should offer comprehensive care from doctors in a variety of specialties who are familiar with the intense fatigue, pain, breathing problems and brain fog that can occur with postviral conditions.</p>



<p>With expanded education for physicians, long COVID patients might one day be able to receive care from their primary care doctors rather than waiting months for specialists. Bishof and other advocates are also pushing for the federal government to fund long COVID centers of excellence, which would provide comprehensive care while working directly with patient groups to develop standards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deer-vehicle-collisions-daylight-saving-time">Deer-vehicle collisions spike when daylight saving time ends</a></h4>

              
                <p>People pay deerly for the switch from daylight saving time.</p>



<p>The change to standard time in autumn corresponds with an average <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01615-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 percent increase in deer-vehicle collisions</a> in the United States, scientists report November 2 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The researchers estimate that eliminating the switch could save nearly 37,000 deer — and 33 human lives.</p>



<p>In a typical year, there are more than 2 million deer-vehicle collisions — about 7 percent of total vehicle crashes. To see how much the biannual time change impacts those numbers, wildlife biologist Laura Prugh and colleagues compiled data from 23 states that tracked whether a crash involved an animal and what time the crash occurred. The team compared those numbers to traffic volumes for each state between 2013 and 2019, focusing on the weeks before and after the switches to daylight saving time in springtime and back to standard time come fall.</p>





<p>Springing forward had little effect, but almost 10 percent of yearly deer collisions on average took place around the autumn fallback — when the bulk of human traffic shifted to after dark. The problem was especially acute on the East Coast. “You see [a] really steep spike in the fall,” says Prugh, of the University of Washington in Seattle. “In the western states, you also see an increase, but it&#8217;s not nearly as sharp.” On the East Coast, the autumn switch falls in the middle of mating season for white-tailed deer. Not only are more drivers active after dark, more deer are too. “The timing could not be worse.”</p>



<p>Eliminating the clock change wouldn’t completely wipe out the spike in crashes — mating season plays a big role, regardless of what time sunset happens.&nbsp;But the scientists estimate that keeping daylight saving time year-round would decrease total deer-human collisions by about 2 percent — saving dozens of people, thousands of human injuries and tens of thousands of deer. It’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/daylight-saving-time-linked-heart-attacks">another reason</a> for us all to move toward the light (<em>SN: 3/31/14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-outbreak-ethiopia-invasive-mosquito-asia">A major malaria outbreak in Ethiopia came from an invasive Asian mosquito</a></h4>

              
                <p>In early 2022, malaria cases in the Ethiopian city of Dire Dawa surged, with more than 2,400 people sickened. The spike in infections was the work of an invasive mosquito species that’s spreading across Africa, scientists report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding, presented November 1 in Seattle at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, provides evidence that the invasive vector can <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/astmh22/abstract/d3220875-3226-4034-bc07-d3fb5bf2170c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive malarial outbreaks</a>. Worryingly, the species can thrive in urban environments, bringing the threat of malaria to potentially many millions more people across the continent.&nbsp;</p>





<p><em>Anopheles stephensi</em> is a mosquito native to India and the Persian Gulf, where it is a major vector for the <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-parasite-mosquitoes-genetics-immune-system">cause malaria in people</a> (<em>SN: 10/26/20</em>). In Africa, the primary malaria vector is <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>. <em>A. stephensi</em> was first reported on the African continent in Djibouti in 2012. Since then, the species has turned up in other African countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia and Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn’t clear what kind of malarial burden the invasive mosquito could bring to Africa, says Fitsum Girma Tadesse, a molecular biologist at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&nbsp;In the eight years after the mosquito’s arrival in Djibouti, the country reported a 40-fold increase in yearly malaria cases, Tadesse says. But no one had directly linked <em>A. stephensi</em> to the increase.</p>



<p>So when malaria cases suddenly rose in Dire Dawa — from 27 cases to 260 in just three weeks in early 2022 — Tadesse and his team jumped in to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers tracked 80 patients in the city who had sought care for malaria at a local or university clinic, as well as 210 patients who had sought treatment for other reasons, and they screened the patients’ household members for malaria. The team also scanned the patients’ neighborhoods for the presence of mosquito adults and larvae within a 100-meter radius of households, or in the cases of students that visited a clinic, dormitories.</p>



<p>The team found that the malaria patients primarily lived near water sources used by the invasive mosquito, <em>A. stephensi</em>. Households and dorms close to aquatic habitats harboring <em>A. stephensi</em> larvae were 3.4 times as likely as those not close to such water sources to have a family or dorm member test positive for malaria. And most of the adult mosquitoes the team caught — 97 percent — were of the invasive species, the only mosquito species that the researchers found carrying <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites.</p>

<p><em>A. stephensi</em> “prefers to breed in water storage containers that are typically common in rapidly expanding urban settings,” Tadesse says. The native mosquito species, <em>A. gambiae</em>, tends to use natural sources of water like small pools, which are more common in rural regions, he adds. The concern, then, is that with the expansion of <em>A. stephensi</em> alongside urbanization in Africa, the mosquito could exploit many new sources of water stores.</p>



<p>“This expands the malaria problem from a predominantly rural problem to an urban problem,” says Teun Bousema, an epidemiologist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2020 study from another research group estimated that if the invasive mosquito were to spread widely on the continent, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2003976117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an additional 126 million people in cities could be at risk</a> of contracting malaria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The spread of <em>Anopheles stephensi</em> is concerning because this species has a number of characteristics that make it difficult to control,” says Tanya Russell, a medical entomologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, who was not involved in the study. Not only can the insects lay their eggs in nearly any available water source, but also the eggs can survive being dry for long periods of time. “This is very uncharacteristic for malaria vectors.”<br><br>Insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying a residual insecticide indoors are the primary vector control approaches for malaria-carrying mosquitoes, Russell says. But since <em>A. stephensi</em> also bites outdoors, the mosquito’s spread may blunt the efficacy of these tools.</p>



<p>The key next steps, Tadesse says, are interventions to reduce transmission of the deadly parasites, including targeting the mosquito’s larval phase with chemicals and encouraging communities to cover and secure water containers to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in them.</p>



<p>“The window of opportunity to do something about this species is closing,” Bousema says. “So, I really think this calls for very urgent action.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-bacteria-beneath-mars-radiation-tolerant">Ancient bacteria could persist beneath Mars’ surface</a></h4>

              
                <p>Radiation-tolerant microbes might be able to live beneath Mars’ surface for hundreds of millions of years and may yet persist today, thanks in part — counterintuitively — to the Red Planet’s frigid, arid conditions.</p>



<p>In addition to being cold and dry, the Martian surface is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays, charged particles and other radiation from space. Previous studies have shown that desiccation vastly extends a microbe’s potential for surviving by limiting the production of highly reactive oxygen-bearing chemicals that can damage proteins and DNA, among other vital molecules within its tissues. To see how long microbes might survive such an onslaught on Mars, researchers desiccated five species of bacteria and one type of yeast, stored them at −80° Celsius and then irradiated them. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Some of the microbes might remain viable for only a few tens of thousands of years, experiments showed. But one species — <em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em>, a particularly radiation-hardy greebly that some scientists have nicknamed “Conan the bacterium” — <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2022.0065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might survive for as long as 280 million years if protected from radiation at soil depths of 10 meters or more</a>, physical chemist Brian Hoffman and colleagues report online October 25 in <em>Astrobiology</em>.</p>



<p><em>D. radiodurans </em>resists radiation damage by having multiple copies of chromosomes and other genetic material in each cell, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbes-survival-manual">high levels of manganese-bearing antioxidants</a> that help remove DNA-damaging chemicals (<em>SN: 9/3/10</em>). If similar microbes evolved on Mars, they too could persist for lengthy intervals, even possibly until now — which is “improbable but not impossible,” says Hoffman, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>Even if microbes that evolved on Mars ultimately succumbed to the harsh conditions, remnants of their proteins or other macromolecules may remain — offering hope that future missions, if equipped with the proper equipment, might be able to detect those signs of former life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/king-tut-tutankhamun-tomb-discovery-archaeology">King Tut’s tomb still has secrets to reveal 100 years after its discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>One hundred years ago, archaeologist Howard Carter stumbled across the tomb of ancient Egypt’s King Tutankhamun. Carter’s life was never the same. Neither was the young pharaoh’s afterlife.</p>



<p>Newspapers around the world immediately ran stories about Carter’s discovery of a long-lost pharaoh’s grave and the wonders it might contain, propelling the abrasive Englishman to worldwide acclaim. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/treasures-boy-king">boy king</a> once consigned to ancient obscurity became the most famous of pharaohs (<em>SN: 12/18/76</em>).</p>



<p>It all started on November 4, 1922, when excavators led by Carter discovered a step cut into the valley floor of a largely unexplored part of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. By November 23, the team had uncovered stairs leading down to a door. A hieroglyphic seal on the door identified what lay beyond: King Tutankhamun’s tomb.</p>





<p>Tutankhamun assumed power around 1334 B.C., when he was about 10 years old. His reign lasted nearly a decade until his untimely demise. Although a minor figure among Egyptian pharaohs, Tutankhamun is one of the few whose richly appointed burial place was found largely intact.</p>



<p>An unusually meticulous excavator for his time, Carter organized a 10-year project to document, conserve and remove more than 6,000 items from Tutankhamun’s four-chambered tomb. While some objects, like Tut’s gold burial mask, are now iconic, many have been in storage and out of sight for decades. But that’s about to change. About 5,400 of Tutankhamun’s well-preserved tomb furnishings are slated to soon go on display when <a href="https://grandegyptianmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new Grand Egyptian Museum</a>, near the Pyramids of Giza, opens.</p>



<p>“The [Tut] burial hoard is something very unique,” Shirin Frangoul-Brückner, managing director of Atelier Brückner in Stuttgart, Germany, the firm that designed the museum’s Tutankhamun Gallery, said in an interview released by her company. Among other items, the exhibit will include the gold burial mask, musical instruments, hunting equipment, jewelry and six chariots.</p>



<p>Even as more of Tut’s story is poised to come to light, here are four things to know on the 100th anniversary of his tomb’s discovery.</p>



<h4>1. Tut may not have been frail.</h4>



<p>Tutankhamun has a reputation as a fragile young man who limped on a clubfoot. Some researchers suspect a weakened immune system set him up for an early death.</p>



<p>But “recent research suggests it’s wrong to portray Tut as a fragile pharaoh,” says Egyptologist and mummy researcher Bob Brier, who is an expert on King Tut. His new book <em>Tutankhamun and the Tomb That Changed the World </em>chronicles how 100 years of research have shaped both Tut’s story and archaeology itself.</p>



<p>Clues from Tutankhamun’s mummy and tomb items boost his physical standing, says Brier, of Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y. The young pharaoh might even have participated in warfare.</p>



<p>Military chariots, leather armor and archery equipment buried with Tutankhamun show that he wanted to be viewed as a hunter and a warrior, Brier says. Inscribed blocks from Tutankhamun’s temple, which were reused in later building projects before researchers identified them, portray the pharaoh leading charioteers in undated battles.</p>



<p>If more blocks turn up showing battle scenes marked with dates, it would suggest Tutankhamun probably participated in those conflicts, Brier says. Pharaohs typically recorded dates of actual battles depicted in their temples, though inscribed scenes may have exaggerated their heroism.</p>



<p>The frail story line has been built in part on the potential discovery of a deformity in Tut’s left foot, along with 130 walking sticks found in his tomb. But ancient Egyptian officials were often depicted with walking sticks as signs of authority, not infirmity, Brier says. And researchers’ opinions vary about whether images of Tut’s bones reveal serious deformities.</p>



<p>X-rays of the recovered mummy from the 1960s show no signs of a misshapen ankle that would have caused a limp. Neither did CT images examined in 2005 by the Egyptian Mummy Project, headed by Egyptologist and former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Zahi Hawass.</p>



<p>Then a 2009 reexamination of the CT images by the same researchers indicated that Tutankhamun had a left-foot deformity generally associated with walking on the ankle or the side of the foot, the team reported. The team’s radiologist, Sahar Saleem of Egypt’s Cairo University, says the CT images show that Tutankhamun experienced a mild left clubfoot, bone tissue death at the ends of two long bones that connect to the second and third left toes and a missing bone in the second left toe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline1-678x450.jpg" alt="three researchers stand beside Tutankhamun’s mummy in front of a CT machine" class="wp-image-3118741" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline1-678x450.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline1-577x383.jpg 577w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline1-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118741">Researchers prepare to slide Tutankhamun’s mummy into a CT scanner. CT images of the pharaoh’s bones have provided disputed evidence of a clubfoot that may have caused a pronounced limp.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118741">Danita Delimont/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Those foot problems would have “caused the king pain when he walked or pressed his weight on his foot, and the clubfoot must have caused limping,” Saleem says. So a labored gait, rather than an appeal to royal authority, could explain the many walking sticks placed in Tutankhamun’s tomb, she says.</p>



<p>Brier, however, doubts that scenario. Tutankhamun’s legs appear to be symmetrical in the CT images, he says, indicating that any left foot deformity was too mild to cause the pharaoh regularly to put excess weight on his right side while walking.</p>



<p>Whether or not the boy king limped through life, the discovery and study of his mummy made it clear that he died around age 19, on the cusp of adulthood. Yet Tut’s cause of death still proves elusive.</p>



<p>In a 2010 analysis of DNA extracted from the pharaoh’s mummy, Hawass and colleagues contended that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malaria, as well as the tissue-destroying bone disorder</a> cited by Saleem from the CT images, hastened Tutankhamun’s death. But other researchers, including Brier, disagree with that conclusion. Further ancient DNA studies using powerful new tools for extracting and testing genetic material from the mummy could help solve that mystery. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>2. Tut’s initial obscurity led to his fame.</h4>



<p>After Tutankhamun’s death, ancient Egyptian officials did their best to erase historical references to him. His reign was rubbed out because his father, Akhenaten, was a “heretic king” who alienated his own people by banishing the worship of all Egyptian gods save for one.</p>



<p>“Akhenaten is the first monotheist recorded in history,” Brier says. Ordinary Egyptians who had prayed to hundreds of gods suddenly could worship only Aten, a sun god formerly regarded as a minor deity.</p>



<p>Meeting intense resistance to his banning of cherished religious practices, Akhenaten — who named himself after Aten — moved to an isolated city, Amarna, where he lived with his wife Nefertiti, six girls, one boy and around 20,000 followers. After Akhenaten died, residents of the desert outpost returned to their former homes. Egyptians reclaimed their old-time religion. Akhenaten’s son, Tutankhaten — also originally named after Aten — became king, and his name was changed to Tutankhamun in honor of Amun, the most powerful of the Egyptian gods at the time.</p>



<p>Later pharaohs omitted from written records any mentions of Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. Tut’s tomb was treated just as dismissively. Huts of craftsmen working on the tomb of King Ramses VI nearly 200 years after Tut’s death were built over the stairway leading down to Tutankhamun’s nearby, far smaller tomb. Limestone chips from the construction littered the site.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="907" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2.jpg" alt="painting of Tutankhamun and his queen on the backrest of his gold throne" class="wp-image-3118739" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2-287x383.jpg 287w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2-337x450.jpg 337w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2-139x186.jpg 139w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2-435x580.jpg 435w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/102422_bb_tut_inline2-582x776.jpg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118739">The backrest of Tutankhamun’s gold throne displays a painting of the king and his queen, Ankhesenamun, in an unusually relaxed pose for Egyptian royal art.

<p>The huts remained in place until Carter showed up. While Carter found evidence that the boy king’s tomb had been entered twice after it was sealed, whoever had broken in took no major objects.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Tutankhamun’s ignominy and insignificance saved him” from tomb robbers, says UCLA Egyptologist Kara Cooney.</p>



<h4>3. Tut’s tomb was a rushed job.</h4>



<p>Pharaohs usually prepared their tombs over decades, building many rooms to hold treasures and extravagant coffins. Egyptian traditions required the placement of a mummified body in a tomb about 70 days after death. That amount of time may have allowed a mummy to dry out sufficiently while retaining enough moisture to fold the arms across the body inside a coffin, Brier suspects.</p>



<p>Because Tutankhamun died prematurely, he had no time for extended tomb preparations. And the 70-day burial tradition gave craftsmen little time to finish crucial tomb items, many of which required a year or more to make. Those objects include a carved stone sarcophagus that encased three nested coffins, four shrines, hundreds of servant statues, a gold mask, chariots, jewelry, beds, chairs and an alabaster chest that contained four miniature gold coffins for Tutankhamun’s internal organs removed during mummification.</p>



<p>Evidence points to workers repurposing many objects from other people’s tombs for Tutankhamun. Even then, time ran out.</p>



<p>Consider the sarcophagus. Two of four goddesses on the stone container lack fully carved jewelry. Workers painted missing jewelry parts. Carved pillars on the sarcophagus are also unfinished.</p>



<p>Tutankhamun’s granite sarcophagus lid, a mismatch for the quartzite bottom, provides another clue to workers’ frenzied efforts. Something must have happened to the original quartzite lid, so workers carved a new lid from available granite and painted it to look like quartzite, Brier says.</p>



<p>Repairs on the new lid indicate that it broke in half during the carving process. “Tutankhamun was buried with a cracked, mismatched sarcophagus lid,” Brier says.</p>



<p>Tutankhamun’s sarcophagus may originally have been made for Smenkare, a mysterious individual who some researchers identify as the boy king’s half brother. Little is known about Smenkare, who possibly reigned for about a year after Akhenaten’s death, just before Tutankhamun, Brier says. But Smenkare’s tomb has not been found, leaving the sarcophagus puzzle unsolved.</p>



<p>Objects including the young king’s throne, three nested coffins and the shrine and tiny coffins for his internal organs also contain evidence of having originally belonged to someone else before being modified for reuse, says Harvard University archaeologist Peter Der Manuelian.</p>

<p>Even Tutankhamun’s tomb may not be what it appears. Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves of the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition in Tucson has argued since 2015 that the boy king’s burial place was intended for Nefertiti. He argues that Nefertiti briefly succeeded Akhenaten as Egypt’s ruler and was the one given the title Smenkare.</p>



<p>No one has found Nefertiti’s tomb yet. But Reeves predicts that one wall of Tutankhamun’s burial chamber blocks access to a larger tomb where Nefertiti lies. Painted scenes and writing on that wall depict Tutankhamun performing a ritual on Nefertiti’s mummy, he asserts. And the gridded structure of those paintings was used by Egyptian artists years before Tutankhamun’s burial but not at the time of his interment.</p>



<p>But four of five remote sensing studies conducted inside Tutankhamun’s tomb have found no evidence of a hidden tomb. Nefertiti, like Smenkare, remains a mystery.</p>



<h4>4. Tut’s tomb changed archaeology and the antiquities trade.</h4>



<p>Carter’s stunning discovery occurred as Egyptians were protesting British colonial rule and helped fuel that movement. Among the actions that enraged Egyptian officials: Carter and his financial backer, a wealthy British aristocrat named Lord Carnarvon, sold exclusive newspaper coverage of the excavation to <em>The Times</em> of London. Things got so bad that Egypt’s government locked Carter out of the tomb for nearly a year, starting in early 1924.</p>



<p>Egyptian nationalists wanted political independence — and an end to decades of foreign adventurers bringing ancient Egyptian finds back to their home countries. Tutankhamun’s resurrected tomb pushed Egyptian authorities toward enacting laws and policies that helped to end the British colonial state and reduce the flow of antiquities out of Egypt, Brier says, though it took decades. Egypt became a nation totally independent of England in 1953. A 1983 law decreed that antiquities could no longer be taken out of Egypt (though those removed before 1983 are still legal to own and can be sold through auction houses).</p>



<p>In 1922, however, Carter and Lord Carnarvon regarded many objects in Tutankhamun’s tomb as theirs for the taking, Brier says. That was the way that Valley of the Kings excavations had worked for the previous 50 years, in a system that divided finds equally between Cairo’s Egyptian Museum and an expedition’s home institution. Taking personal mementos was also common.</p>



<p>Evidence of Carter’s casual pocketing of various artifacts while painstakingly clearing the boy king’s tomb continues to emerge. “Carter didn’t sell what he took,” Brier says. “But he felt he had a right to take certain items as the tomb’s excavator.”</p>

<p>Recently recovered letters of English Egyptologist Alan Gardiner from the 1930s, described by Brier in his book, recount how Carter gave Gardiner several items from Tutankhamun’s tomb, including an ornament used as a food offering for the dead. French Egyptologist Marc Gabolde of Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3 University has tracked down beads, jewelry, a headdress fragment and other items taken from Tutankhamun’s tomb by Carter and Carnarvon.</p>



<p>Yet it is undeniable that one of Tutankhamun’s greatest legacies, thanks to Carter, is the benchmark the excavation of his tomb set for future excavations, Brier says. Carter started his career as an artist who copied painted images on the walls of Egyptian tombs for excavators. He later learned excavation techniques in the field working with an eminent English Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie. Carter took tomb documentation to a new level, rounding up a crack team consisting of a photographer, a conservator, two draftsmen, an engineer and an authority on ancient Egyptian writing.</p>



<p>Their decade-long effort also made possible the new Tutankhamun exhibition at the Grand Egyptian Museum. Now, not only museum visitors but also a new generation of researchers will have unprecedented access to the pharaoh’s tomb trove.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Most of Tutankhamun’s [tomb] objects have been given little if any study beyond what Carter was able to do,” says UCLA’s Cooney.</p>



<p>That won’t be true for much longer, as the most famous tomb in the Valley of the Kings enters the next stage of its public and scientific afterlife.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-paws-traction-snow-microstructures-friction">Here’s how polar bears might get traction on snow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny “fingers” can help polar bears get a grip.</p>



<p>Like the rubbery nubs on the bottom of baby socks, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microstructures on the bears’ paw pads</a> offer some extra friction, scientists report November 1 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. The pad protrusions may keep polar bears from slipping on snow, says Ali Dhinojwala, a polymer scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio who has also studied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nanotube-carpet-mimics-gecko-feet">the sticking power of gecko feet</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/05</em>).</p>





<p>Nathaniel Orndorf, a materials scientist at Akron who focuses on ice, adhesion and friction, was interested in the work Dhinojwala’s lab did on geckos, but “we can’t really put geckos on the ice,” he says. So he turned to polar bears.</p>



<p>Orndorf teamed up with Dhinojwala and Austin Garner, an animal biologist now at Syracuse University in New York, and compared the paws of polar bears, brown bears, American black bears and a sun bear. All but the sun bear had paw pad bumps. But the polar bears’ bumps looked a little different. For a given diameter, their bumps tend to be taller, the team found. That extra height translates to more traction on lab-made snow, experiments with 3-D printed models of the bumps suggest.</p>



<p>Until now, scientists didn’t know that bump shape could make the difference between gripping and slipping, Dhinojwala says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="489" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/110122_mr_polar-paw_inline1.jpg" alt="microscope image showing the rough bumps on polar bear paws" class="wp-image-3118788" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/110122_mr_polar-paw_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/110122_mr_polar-paw_inline1-533x383.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/110122_mr_polar-paw_inline1-626x450.jpg 626w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/110122_mr_polar-paw_inline1-259x186.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118788">Rough bumps on the pads of polar bears’ paws (pictured) offer the animals extra traction on snow.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118788">N. Orndorf <em>et al</em>/<em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface </em>2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Polar bear paw pads are also ringed with fur and are smaller than those of other bears, the team reports, adaptations that might let the Arctic animals conserve body heat as they trod upon ice. Smaller pads generally mean less real estate for grabbing the ground. So extra-grippy pads could help polar bears make the most of what they’ve got, Orndorf says.</p>



<p>Along with bumpy pads, the team hopes to study polar bears’ fuzzy paws and short claws, which might also give the animals a nonslip grip.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aye-aye-primates-nose-picking-fingers">Bizarre aye-aye primates take nose picking to the extreme</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aye-ayes are true champions of nose picking.</p>



<p>A new video offers the first evidence that these nocturnal lemurs of Madagascar stick their fingers up their noses and lick off the mucus. They don’t use just any finger for the job, either. The primates go spelunking for snot with the ultralong, witchy middle finger they typically use to find and fish grubs out of tree bark.</p>



<p>A reconstruction of the inside of an aye-aye’s head based on CT scans shows that this spindly digit probably <a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jzo.13034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pokes all the way through the animal’s nasal passages</a> to reach its throat, researchers report online October 26 in the <em>Journal of Zoology</em>. &nbsp;</p>





<p>“This is a brilliant example of how science can serve human curiosity,” says Michael Haslam, a primate archaeologist based in London who was not involved in the new work. “My first take was that it’s a cool — and a bit creepy — video, but [the researchers] have gone beyond that initial reaction of ‘What on Earth?’ to actually explore what’s happening inside the animal.”</p>



<p>The new footage stars Kali, a female aye-aye (<em>Daubentonia madagascariensis</em>) at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, N.C. “The aye-aye stopped eating and started to pick its nose, and I was really surprised,” says evolutionary biologist Anne-Claire Fabre, who filmed the video. “I was wondering where the finger was going.” An aye-aye is about as big as a house cat, but its clawed middle finger is some 8 centimeters long. And Kali was plunging almost the entire digit up her snout to sample her own snot with dainty licks.</p>



<p>“There is one moment where the camera is [shaking], and I was giggling,” says Fabre, of the Natural History Museum of Bern in Switzerland. Afterward, she asked her colleagues if they had ever seen an aye-aye picking its nose. “The ones that were working a lot with aye-ayes would tell me, ‘Oh, yeah, it’s happening really often,’” says Fabre, who later witnessed the behavior in several other aye-ayes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="321" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev.jpg" alt="An illustration of the internal structure of an aye-aye's head to see the inner working and a photo of an aye-aye reaching for the camera" class="wp-image-3118724" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev-330x156.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118724">A reconstruction of the internal structure of an aye-aye’s head, based on CT scans, reveals that when the primate picks its nose, the tip of the long middle digit probably reaches the back of the throat.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118724">From left: © Renaud Boistel; © David Haring/Duke Lemur Center</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This got Fabre and her colleagues curious about how many other primate species have been caught with their fingers in their nostrils. The researchers scoured the literature for past studies and the internet for other videos documenting the behavior.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, “most of the literature that we were finding were jokes,” Fabre says. “I was really surprised, because there is a lot of literature on other types of pretty gross behaviors, such as coprophagy,” or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pika-yak-poop-winter-slow-metabolism-yak-biology">poo eating</a>, among animals (<em>SN: 7/19/21</em>). But between all the bogus articles, the team did find some real reports of primate nose picking, including research done by Jane Goodall in the 1970s.</p>



<p>Aye-ayes are now the 12th known species of primate, including humans, to pick their noses and snack on the snot, the researchers found. Others include gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and macaques. Nose pickers tend to be primates that have especially good dexterity and use tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The team [has] given us the first map of nose picking across our primate family tree, which immediately raises questions about just how much of this behavior is happening out there, unseen or unreported,” Haslam says. He remembers once seeing a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkey-uses-stick-pick-its-teeth-and-nose">capuchin monkey using a twig or stem to pick its nose</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>“I’m surprised that there aren’t more reports on nose picking, especially from zoos where animals are watched every day,” Haslam adds. “Perhaps our own social stigma around it means that scientists are less likely to want to report nose-picking animals, or it may even be seen as too common to be interesting.”</p>

</div><figcaption>This aye-aye, named Kali, was caught on camera sticking her extra-long, skinny middle finger up her nose and then licking off the snot — making her kind the 12th known species of primate to eat their own boogers.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fact that so many primate species have been spotted picking their noses and eating the boogers makes Fabre’s team and Haslam wonder whether this seemingly nasty habit has some unknown advantage. Perhaps eating germ-laden boogers boosts the immune system.</p>



<p>For now, untangling the evolutionary origins and potential perks of nose picking will require a more complete census of what species — primate or otherwise — mine and munch on their own mucus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-swarms-electric-charge-static-electricity-storm-clouds-honeybees">Insect swarms might generate as much electric charge as storm clouds</a></h4>

              
                <p>You might feel a spark when you talk to your crush, but living things don’t require romance to make electricity. A study published October 24 in <em>iScience</em> suggests that <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01513-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the electricity naturally produced by swarming insects like honeybees and locusts</a> is an unappreciated contributor to the overall electric charge of the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“Particles in the atmosphere easily charge up,” says Joseph Dwyer, a physicist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham who was not involved with the study. “Insects are little particles moving around the atmosphere.” Despite this, the potential that insect-induced static electricity plays a role in the atmosphere’s electric field, which influences how water droplets form, dust particles move and lightning strikes brew, hasn’t been considered before, he says.</p>





<p>Scientists have known about the minuscule electric charge carried by living things, such as insects, for a long time. However, the idea that an electric bug-aloo could alter the charge in the air on a large scale came to researchers through sheer chance.</p>



<p>“We were actually interested in understanding how atmospheric electricity influences biology,” says Ellard Hunting, a biologist at the University of Bristol in England. But when a swarm of honeybees passed over a sensor meant to pick up background atmospheric electricity at the team’s field station, the scientists began to suspect that the influence could flow the other way too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunting and colleagues, including biologists and physicists, measured the change in the strength of electric charge when other honeybee swarms passed over the sensor, revealing an average voltage increase of 100 volts per meter. The denser the insect swarm, the greater the charge produced.</p>



<p>This inspired the team to think about even larger insect swarms, like the biblical hordes of locusts that plagued Egypt in antiquity (and, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weather-radar-grasshopper-swarm-las-vegas-night-artificial-light">in 2021, Las Vegas</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/21</em>)). Flying objects, from animals to airplanes, build up static electricity as they move through the air. The team measured the charges of individual desert locusts (<em>Schistocerca gregaria</em>) as they flew in a wind tunnel powered by a computer fan. Taking data on locust density from other studies, the team then used a computer simulation based on the honeybee swarm data to scale up these single locust measurements into electric charge estimates for an entire locust swarm. Clouds of locusts could produce electricity on a per-meter basis on par with that in storm clouds, the scientists report.</p>



<p>Hunting says the results highlight the need to explore the unknown lives of airborne animals, which can sometimes reach much greater heights than honeybees or locusts. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soaring-spiders-may-get-cues-electric-charges-air">Spiders, for example, can soar kilometers above Earth when “ballooning”</a> on silk threads to reach new habitats (<em>SN: 7/5/18</em>). “There’s a lot of biology in the sky,” he says, from insects and birds to microorganisms. “Everything adds up.”</p>



<p>Though some insect swarms can be immense, Dwyer says that electrically charged flying animals are unlikely to ever reach the density required to produce lightning like storm clouds do. But their presence could interfere with our efforts to watch for looming strikes that could hurt people or damage property.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“If you have something messing up our electric field measurements, that could cause a false alarm,” he says, “or it could make you miss something that’s actually important.” While the full effect that insects and other animals have on atmospheric electricity remains to be deduced, Dwyer says these results are “an interesting first look” into the phenomenon.</p>



<p>Hunting says this initial step into an exciting new area of research shows that working with scientists from different fields can spark shocking findings. “Being really interdisciplinary,” he says, “allows for these kinds of serendipitous moments.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-turbines-capture-carbon-dioxide-power">Wind turbines could help capture carbon dioxide while providing power</a></h4>

              
                <p>Wind turbines could offer a double whammy in the fight against climate change.</p>



<p>Besides harnessing wind to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-farm-windbreak-turbine-speed-power-output">generate clean energy</a>, turbines may help to funnel carbon dioxide to systems that pull the greenhouse gas out of the air (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>). Researchers say their simulations show that wind turbines can drag dirty air from above a city or a smokestack into the turbines’ wakes. That boosts the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that makes it to machines that can remove it from the atmosphere. The researchers plan to describe <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/L14.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their simulations</a> and <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/L14.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wind tunnel test</a> of a scaled-down system at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis on November 21.</p>





<p>Addressing climate change will require dramatic reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide that humans put into the air — but that alone <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">won’t be enough</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). One part of the solution could be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-carbon-dioxide-capture-recycling-climate-change">direct air capture</a> systems that remove some CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (<em>SN: 9/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>But the large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by factories, power plants and cities are often concentrated at heights that put it out of reach of machinery on the ground that can remove it. “We’re looking into the fluid dynamics benefits of utilizing the wake of the wind turbine to redirect higher concentrations” down to carbon capture systems, says mechanical engineer Clarice Nelson of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>As large, power-generating wind turbines rotate, they cause turbulence that pulls air down into the wakes behind them, says mechanical engineer Luciano Castillo, also of Purdue. It’s an effect that can concentrate carbon dioxide enough to make capture feasible, particularly near large cities like Chicago.</p>



<p>“The beauty is that [around Chicago], you have one of the best wind resources in the region, so you can use the wind turbine to take some of the dirty air in the city and capture it,” Castillo says. Wind turbines don’t require the cooling that nuclear and fossil fuel plants need. “So not only are you producing clean energy,” he says, “you are not using water.”</p>



<p>Running the capture systems from energy produced by the wind turbines can also address the financial burden that often goes along with removing CO<sub>2 </sub>from the air. “Even with tax credits and potentially selling the CO<sub>2</sub>, there’s a huge gap between the value that you can get from capturing it and the actual cost” that comes with powering capture with energy that comes from other sources, Nelson says. “Our method would be a no-cost added benefit” to wind turbine farms.</p>



<p>There are probably lots of factors that will impact CO<sub>2 </sub>transport by real-world turbines, including the interactions the turbine wakes have with water, plants and the ground, says Nicholas Hamilton, a mechanical engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., who was not involved with the new studies. “I’m interested to see how this group scaled their experiment for wind tunnel investigation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-another-huge-challenge">Long COVID brings another huge challenge to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the fall of 2020, the world was staggering under the attack of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the United States, more than 4 million cases were reported in November, more than double the number in October. Hospitals were overwhelmed. On the Thursday before Thanksgiving, 1,962 people died.</p>



<p>Now, despite more than 1 million deaths in the United States and more than 6 million worldwide, it’s almost easy to forget that the pandemic’s assault continues. That is, until you hear Belinda Hankins’ story.</p>





<p>Hankins has been diagnosed with long COVID, a collection of symptoms that can include crushing fatigue, brain fog, pain and dizziness and that may affect 1 in 5 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, according to one conservative estimate. She talked with <em>Science News</em> staff writer Meghan Rosen during her appointment at the long COVID clinic at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.</p>



<p>“For months we’ve heard estimates about how many people have long COVID,” Rosen told me. “I was interested in going beyond the stats to find out what it’s like for the patients and doctors living with this.”</p>



<p>That effort involved talking with doctors who are trying to figure out how to treat the symptoms of long COVID when the cause is still unknown. And talking with Hankins. “I thought it was extraordinary that [she] let me into her appointment,” Rosen said. “It’s just so generous and so brave.”</p>



<p>I share Rosen’s gratitude. Asking someone in the midst of a life-altering illness to talk with a journalist is a big request. I always worry that people might feel pressure to participate, and I want to be sure that they’ve had time to think through the implications of going public with personal information. Hankins was clear about why she said yes. “She wanted to share her story because a lot of people in her life don’t know what long COVID is and why she’s still so sick,” Rosen said.</p>



<p>In reporting, Rosen brings both her empathy and her serious science chops. She has a Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology and is a graduate of the science journalism program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She explored careers in biotech but decided that wasn’t the right fit. She wanted to write about health and medicine.</p>



<p>This is actually Rosen’s third stint at <em>Science News</em>: first as an intern, then as a reporter, and now back on the beat after five years of doing communications work for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. We’re glad she’s back. Not only is she tackling complex issues surrounding COVID-19, including<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus"> how U.S. public health guidelines affect kids in school</a> (<em>SN Online: 8/19/22</em>), she’s also been sharing her delight in science. That includes stories on genetic variants linked to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/uncombable-hair-syndrome-gene">uncombable hair in children</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 5</em>); an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zoo-gorilla-new-vocalization-call-cough-sound-human-attention">unusual “snough” call</a> that zoo gorillas appear to have invented to get zookeepers’ attention (<em>SN Online: 8/10/22</em>); and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-pill-mucus-gut-deliver-medicine">a new robotic pill designed to deliver drugs</a> by scrubbing away mucus in the intestines.</p>



<p>Yes, science is serious and important, but it’s also crazy fun. I don’t think I’m ready to sign up for the robotic intestinal scrub brush, but I sure do enjoy finding out about it.</p>

<h4>What’s the matter?</h4>



<p><em>The proposed Windchime experiment plans to use only gravity to detect some types of dark matter. Ultrasensitive sensors would be jostled by the gravitational forces of a dark matter “wind” passing by Earth, <strong>James R. Riordon</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/windchime-experiment-dark-matter-wind-gravity-physics">Gravity could aid dark matter search</a>” (</em>SN: 9/10/22, p. 14<em>).</em></p>



<p>Since dark matter is affected by gravity, reader <strong>David Goldberg</strong> asked if dark matter orbits the Milky Way’s center just like our solar system does. If the two move together, how would there be a dark matter wind to detect?</p>





<p>It’s possible that dark matter circles the Milky Way’s center at least a little, though it’s hard to say for sure because no one has been able to measure the elusive stuff yet, <strong>Riordon</strong> says. But to search for dark matter using the Windchime method, it doesn’t really matter whether the mysterious substance moves with the galaxy, he says. That’s because as the sun circles the Milky Way’s center, Earth is also orbiting the sun. Even if the sun happens to move with the same velocity as nearby dark matter, the direction of Earth’s velocity changes over the course of a year, <strong>Riordon</strong> says. So we should sense the pull of a dark matter wind that shifts with Earth’s seasons.</p>



<p>What’s more, as the planet spins on its axis, the direction of the surface’s movement relative to the galaxy changes throughout the day. “It’s a little like a fish swimming in the ocean,” <strong>Riordon</strong> says. “Even though the water in general moves with Earth, as a fish swims in various directions, the creature will experience a flow of water relative to its own motion.”</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Jack Ryan</strong> wondered why, despite its gravitational attraction, dark matter doesn’t form stars, planets and other celestial bodies.</p>



<p>“Because no one knows what dark matter is, we can’t say for certain that it can or cannot form globs or come in very massive particles,” <strong>Riordon</strong> says. “It’s something that researchers like those on the Windchime team are looking out for.”</p>



<p>For normal matter to create asteroids or planets, it must experience some force beyond gravity, <strong>Riordon</strong> says. For instance, if two rocks collide in space, electromagnetic forces would prevent them from simply passing through each other. This would then allow gravity to hold the two rocks together. And if the concentration of matter continues to build up, then an asteroid or a planet could eventually form.</p>



<p>Some physicists hope that dark matter experiences other forces, but gravity is currently the only one known to affect it. “If a dark matter particle that only experiences gravity approaches a rock, a planet or another dark matter particle, it would glide right through because there is no force that can stop it,” <strong>Riordon</strong> says. “Gravity can pull dark matter into a halo, but on its own, it probably can’t stick dark matter together.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for a great 25-year review of the Mars rovers,” reader <strong>Leslie Hruby</strong> wrote. “With your pictures and short descriptions of the Mars rovers, my grandsons [shown], ages 3 ½ and 5, made their own Mars rover … in our four-wheeled wagon (not six like the rovers) with boxes, tape and drinking cups, with a little help from grandma in taping.”</p>



<p>“Cups at rear are the engines. Other cups are cameras, and side boxes are for collecting rocks. Note their design for oxygen tanks (packing bubbles) taped on their chests,” <strong>Hruby</strong> wrote. “They ran their rover wagon down the hill in gales of laughter, proving that science can be great fun, as it broke apart.”</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m glad to share that I am going to start my own junior research group at the University of Zurich in March 2023!</p>



<p>As an <a href="https://www.snf.ch/en/N18L3oGWomTSSGkF/funding/careers/ambizione">Ambizione</a> fellow, I will receive funding for my own salary, some equipment, consumables and a PhD student (total of ca. 900k CHF). There will be possibilities to recruit more students, but I will try to start small, so that I can spend my time with my students, experiments and data analysis and less so with buraucratic obligations that come with other positions. The general research direction of my group is already reflected by some write-ups of previous years (<em><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain/">2018</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">2019</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/12/31/annual-report-2021/">2021</a></em>). There will be a focus on single neurons, plasticity, possibly also dendrites, and closed-loop paradigms.</p>



<p>My group will benefit from being part of the <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">lab of Fritjof Helmchen</a>. Working with all the resources and experts available in the Helmchen Lab, and at the same time being supervised by myself is probably not bad combination!</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re finishing your Master&#8217;s right now and are looking for a PhD position, or if you have a talented Master&#8217;s student who would be a good fit for my group, get in touch with me. Here&#8217;s the official position opening:</p>



<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>



<p>The SNSF AMBIZIONE junior group of <strong><em>Dr. Peter Rupprecht</em></strong> at the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Switzerland (starting 1.3.2023), is offering a PhD position to study neuronal circuits in the living mouse brain. The goal of the project is to understand how a single neuron learns about the effect of its action potentials. The project therefore addresses the problem of “credit assignment” in the brain experimentally.</p>



<p>The project will be conducted in the lab of and officially supervised by <strong><em>Prof. Fritjof Helmchen</em></strong>. Working on this project will therefore provide ample opportunity to collaborate with and learn from some of the best neuroscientists.</p>



<p>The methods to drive this project will be, among others, <em>in vivo</em> calcium imaging of neuronal activity, <em>in vivo</em> cell-attached recordings, closed-loop virtual realities, and advanced data analysis methods. You will be able to select your favorite sub-projects and techniques from this spectrum, and you will receive direct guidance from Peter Rupprecht to learn anything that is required.</p>



<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>



<p>You have studied neuroscience, physics, biology, informatics or a related field. You are familiar with or eager to learn the techniques required for this project, including elements of microscopy, mouse handling, electrophysiology, programming and data analysis in Python and/or Matlab. Ideally, you enjoy solving problems, even if it takes long and the problems are difficult. Some programming skills or the strong desire to acquire such are important for any kind of project in this lab.</p>



<p><strong>Application guideline</strong></p>



<p>Please send your application including a CV and your transcript of records to Peter Rupprecht (<a href="mailto:rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch">rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch</a>). Please include a letter of motivation that covers the following aspects: What talents or previous experience of yours are possibly relevant to this project? What would you like to learn and achieve during your PhD? Do you enjoy writing in English? If you have coding or experimental experience, describe your most challenging previous program or project.</p>



<p><strong>Starting date</strong></p>



<p>The PhD position is available starting March 2023.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-lions-wildfires-risks-road-crossing">Mountain lions pushed out by wildfires take more risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mountain lions have no interest in people, or the built-up areas we enjoy. But after a 2018 wildfire in California, local lions took more risks, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222014762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing roads more often and moving around more in the daytime</a>, scientists report October 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>. It’s another way the effects of human development could be putting pressure on vulnerable wildlife — in this case, potentially pushing them toward our bumpers.</p>



<p>The Woolsey Fire began near Los Angeles on November 8, 2018, and burned more than 36,000 hectares in the Santa Monica Mountains. Nearly 300,000 people evacuated, and three people died. Animals fled the fire too, including the local mountain lions (<em>Puma concolor</em>). The fire was a tragedy, but also a scientific opportunity, says Rachel Blakey, a global change biologist at UCLA. Many of the lions wore tracking collars, allowing scientists to study how the fire changed their behavior.</p>





<p>Of the 11 collared cougars in the area at the time, nine made it to safety during the fire itself. “They have really large home ranges, so it&#8217;s nothing to them to be able to cover many kilometers in a day,” Blakey says.</p>



<p>No matter how much they moved, the mountain lions avoided people. One collared cat, P-64, initially fled the fire — until he got close to a developed area. Given the choice between fire and people, the lion retreated back into the burning area. “That’s where his movements stopped,” Blakey says. The park service later found P-64’s remains. He&#8217;d burned his paws, and it’s possible that he was unable to hunt and starved to death.</p>



<p>Using data from the nine lions that survived the fire and others collared after, the scientists showed that the cats generally avoided the severely burned areas of their territories. With vegetation gone, the cats had little cover for stalking and ambushing prey.</p>



<p>Instead, the cougars stuck to unburned areas, and continued to avoid people. But they took more risks around human infrastructure, increasing their road crossings from an average of about three times per month to five. </p>

<p>These weren’t all two-lane country highways. The first collared lion to successfully cross Interstate 405, which has 10 lanes in places, did it after the Woolsey Fire. And the big cats crossed U.S. Route 101 once every four months, whereas before the fire, they’d crossed only once every two years. Their territories also overlapped more often, increasing the potential for deadly encounters between the solitary cats. And the generally nocturnal animals increased activity during daytime hours from 10 percent to 16 percent of their active time — boosting a lion’s chances of potentially bump into a human.</p>



<p>Road crossing is what Blakey calls a “risk mismatch.” Lions in areas with lots of people appear to weigh the risk of encountering humans as more dangerous. But “running across a freeway is a lot more likely to be fatal,” she says. That risk, combined with the risk of running into other cats, can be deadly. One young, collared male ended up dead on a freeway in the months after the fire. He was fleeing a fight with an older, uncollared male. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intense burns like the Woolsey Fire highlight the resilience of mountain lions, says Winston Vickers, a wildlife research veterinarian at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study. “They have amazing mobility, they mostly can get away from the immediate fire, they mostly survive,” he notes. The changes in risk-taking, he says, could reflect how confined the population is, hemmed into the mountains by human development.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animals-get-safe-spots-cross-road-and-car-collisions-drop">Wildlife crossings</a>, such as the new Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing over the 101, will hopefully give the mountain lions a safer option for roaming, though the main goal is to promote gene flow between lion populations, Blakey says (<em>SN: 5/31/16</em>). In a landscape where fire, humans and highways combine, it’s good to have somewhere to run. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">Meet the BOAT, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brightest gamma-ray burst ever recorded recently lit up a distant galaxy — and astronomers have nicknamed it the BOAT, for Brightest of All Time.</p>



<p>“We use the boat emoji a lot when we’re talking about it” on the messaging app Slack, says astronomer Jillian Rastinejad of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>Gamma-ray bursts are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-two-gamma-ray-bursts-created-record-breaking-high-energy-photons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energetic explosions</a> that go off when a massive star dies and leaves behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black hole</a> or neutron star (<em>SN: 11/20/19; SN: 8/2/21</em>). The collapse sets off jets of gamma rays zipping away from the poles of the former star. If those jets happen to be pointed right at Earth, astronomers can see them as a gamma-ray burst.</p>





<p>This <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new burst</a>, officially named GRB 221009A, was probably triggered by a supernova giving birth to a black hole in a galaxy about 2 billion light-years from Earth, researchers announced October 13. Astronomers think it released as much energy as roughly three suns converting all of their mass to pure energy.</p>



<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, a gamma-ray telescope in space, automatically detected the blast October 9 around 10:15 a.m. EDT, and promptly alerted astronomers <a href="https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that something strange was happening</a>.</p>



<p>“At the time, when it went off, it looked kind of weird to us,” says Penn State astrophysicist Jamie Kennea, who is the head of science operations for Swift. The blast’s position in the sky seemed to line up with the plane of the Milky Way. So at first Kennea and colleagues thought it was within our own galaxy, and so unlikely to be something as dramatically energetic as a gamma-ray burst. If a burst like this went off inside the Milky Way, it would be visible to the naked eye, which wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>But soon Kennea learned that NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope had also seen the flash — and it was one of the brightest things the telescope had ever seen. A fresh look at the Swift data convinced Kennea and colleagues that the flash was the brightest gamma-ray burst seen in the 50 years of observing these rare explosions.</p>



<p>“It’s quite exceptional,” Kennea says. “It stands head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>

Cenko</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After confirmation of the burst’s BOAT bonafides — a term coined by Rastinejad’s adviser, Northwestern astronomer Wen-fai Fong — other astronomers rushed to get a look. Within days, scientists around the world got a glimpse of the blast with telescopes in space and on the ground, in nearly every type of light. Even some radio telescopes typically used as lightning detectors saw a <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/32745.gcn3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden disturbance associated with GRB 221009A</a>, suggesting that the burst stripped electrons from atoms in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the hours and days after the initial explosion, the burst subsided and gave way to a still relatively bright afterglow. Eventually, astronomers expect to see it fade&nbsp;even more, replaced by glowing ripples of material in the supernova remnant.</p>



<p>The extreme brightness was probably at least partially due to GRB 221009A’s relative proximity, Kennea says. A couple billion light-years might seem far, but the average gamma-ray burst is more like 10 billion light-years away. It probably was also just intrinsically bright, though there hasn’t been time to figure out why.</p>



<p>Studying the blast as it changes is “probably going to challenge some of our assumptions of how gamma-ray bursts work,” Kennea says. “I think people who are gamma-ray burst theorists are going to be inundated with so much data that this is going to change theories that they thought were pretty solid.”</p>



<p>GRB 221009A will move behind the sun from Earth’s perspective starting in late November, shielding it temporarily from view. But because its glow is still so bright now, astronomers are hopeful that they’ll still be able to see it when it becomes visible again in February.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited for a few months from now when we have all the beautiful data,” Rastinejad says.</p>
