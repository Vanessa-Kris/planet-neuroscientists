<p><strong>Oil on the waters </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/oil-waters-modest-progress-cleanup-technology"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 14, 1972</p>



<p>[In the late 1960s], about the best means of cleaning up oil was to put straw on it, then scoop up the oily straw by hand or with pitchforks. Now industry … has devised an arsenal of oil cleanup chemicals. Thin-layer chemicals can be used to herd oil together and to thicken it…. Chemicals are available as absorbents too. Still other chemicals … disperse oil throughout the water. Other chemicals show promise as oil-burning agents.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Chemicals are the norm today, but the future of oil-cleanup technology may well be microbial. In recent years, researchers have shown that soil microbes broke down some of the oil from the 2010 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-munching-microbes-cleaning-gulf-marshes-faster-expected">Deepwater Horizon spill</a> in the Gulf of Mexico (<em>SN Online: 6/26/15</em>). And electrical bacteria, which channel electricity through their threadlike bodies, could help by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrical-bacteria-may-help-clean-oil-spills-and-curb-methane-emissions">turning oil munchers’ waste into fuel for the microbes</a>, scientists reported (<em>SN: 7/16/22&nbsp;&amp; 7/30/22, p.&nbsp;24</em>). Microbial mops aren’t yet ready for prime time, so chemical dispersants, fire and spongelike sorbents remain key tools in cleanup kits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-eye-nebula-3d-model-rings-jets">A 3-D model of the Cat’s Eye nebula shows rings sculpted by jets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly 3,000 light-years from Earth sits one of the most complex and least understood nebulae, a whirling landscape of gas and dust left in the wake of a star’s death throes. A new computer visualization reveals the 3-D structure of the Cat’s Eye nebula and hints at how not one, but a pair of dying stars sculpted its complexity.</p>



<p>The digital reconstruction, based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope, reveals two symmetric rings around the nebula’s edges. The rings were probably formed by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/516/2/2711/6696946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spinning jet of charged gas that was launched from two stars</a> in the nebula’s center, Ryan Clairmont and colleagues report in the October <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em><em>.</em></p>





<p>“I realized there hasn’t been a comprehensive study of the structure of the nebula since the early ’90s,” says Clairmont, an undergraduate at Stanford University. Last year, while a high school student in San Diego, he reached out to a couple of astrophysicists at a scientific imaging company called Ilumbra who had written software to reconstruct the 3-D structure of astronomical objects.</p>



<p>The team combined Hubble images with ground-based observations of light in several wavelengths, which revealed the motions of the nebula’s gas. Figuring out which parts were moving toward and away from Earth helped reveal its 3-D structure.</p>



<p>The team identified two partial rings to either side of the nebula’s center. The rings’ symmetry and unfinished nature suggest they are the remains of a plasma jet launched from the heart of the nebula, then snuffed out before it could complete a full circle. Such jets are usually formed through an interaction between two stars orbiting one another, says Ilumbra partner Wolfgang Steffen, who is based in Kaiserslautern, Germany.</p>



<p>The work <a href="https://projectboard.world/isef/finalist-booth/phys038---evolution-of-the-cats-eye-nebula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Clairmont a prize at the 2021 International Science and Engineering Fair</a>, an annual competition run by the Society for Science, which publishes <em>Science News</em>. Steffen was skeptical about the tight deadline — when Clairmont reached out, he had just two months to complete the project.</p>



<p>“I said that’s impossible! Not even Ph.D. students or anybody has tried that before,” Steffen says. “He did it brilliantly. He pulled it all off and more than we expected.”</p>

<h2><strong>Retraction specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is a retraction still seen in the academic community as a potentially career-ending/negative event for an author? Is this view changing?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is indeed still an issue, possibly in some countries more than others. We hope that the general view will change, and that those in positions to decide on sanctions, promotions, tenure decisions, and funding will consider case details rather than take a blanket view on retractions. Not all retractions are the same. There are cases of blatant and purposeful academic misconduct, which should have a negative effect on the perpetrator&rsquo;s career, but even in these cases there may be co-authors who were uninvolved in and unaware of the misconduct. There are also cases that stem from misunderstandings about authorship or data ownership, reporting errors and data unavailability, or honest errors. In some of these cases, a retraction may be an indicator of a training gap. Punishing retractions uniformly, without considering context, may not get to the root of the issue, helps to perpetuate stigma around retractions, and may deter researchers from stepping forward when they become aware of major concerns. Authors who proactively reach out to request retraction when they discover an error with their paper should be applauded rather than punished. </span><b>Is this view changing? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional and funding body representatives would be better placed than publishers to answer this, although publishers can do their part by providing clear information in retraction notices as to the reasons for retraction, and by notifying the relevant parties in cases where an institutional investigation may be warranted. </span></p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you think questions/concerns raised on places like pubpeer should be anonymous and without any accompanying declaration of Conflicts of Interests?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong>&nbsp; It is helpful to give readers the option of listing their name or posting anonymously according to their personal preference. Anonymity can help readers to express concerns without fear of reprisal, particularly in cases where one raises concerns about work by a colleague, collaborator, or researcher who may contribute to one&rsquo;s own career (e.g. via grant review). On the other hand, if a reader is comfortable providing their name &ndash; whether on a public site such as Pubpeer or in a personal communication to the journal/publisher &ndash; then they can obtain public credit for their observations (if they self-identify publicly), and the journal/publisher can follow up with them directly to ask for any clarifications and provide an update when the case is resolved. I am a proponent of transparently declaring potential conflicts of interest, but I appreciate that in some cases these interests may be identifying. At PLOS, we follow up on concerns about our content whether or not the person raising them has potential conflicts. Importantly, we focus our investigations on the issues, article content, and evidence (e.g. primary data), not on the person who raised the concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: How much evidence do journals need to raise questions about scientific integrity of data?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch: </strong>We investigate every claim that calls into question the integrity of any paper we publish, but we need readers to provide specific details as to the nature of the concerns and which results are in question. In cases involving data integrity concerns, if a reader has already done an analysis or made an observation that supports their concerns, then providing details of the analysis and/or findings can greatly aid in our assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Journal-specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is there a time limitation post publication to file a grievance with a Journal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>No. However, some universities and research institutions have time limits as to when they will investigate concerns, and this can present a barrier to journal-level work in some cases.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why do journals refuse the self-citation and consider it as plagiarism?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> We do not refuse self-citation, i.e. citation of one&rsquo;s previous works. However, re-using previously published content without citing the original source is misleading and in some cases may present copyright concerns. Also, authors should not preferentially cite their own works over others, rather they should discuss the relevant literature in a balanced manner that accurately represents the current state of the field, giving due attribution to all key contributors.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not publish in an Appendix anonymized reviewer comments and author responses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> While the standard in the field has historically been to hold peer review as confidential, some publishers and other stakeholders have recently taken steps toward opening up peer review and providing transparency as to the article assessment process. Since 2019, PLOS has offered authors the option of publishing peer review history (review reports and decision letters) alongside accepted research articles. We use a separate tab on article pages for peer review history rather than an Appendix. This allows interested readers to navigate easily through the various documents. While we encourage this transparency with regard to article assessment, it is not mandatory. For additional discussion of transparent peer review, see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/08/transparency-credit-and-peer-review/">here</a> and<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/"> here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not routinely provide the public with the possibility of evaluating scientific conclusions through links to the evidence on which conclusions are based?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This is one of the primary objectives of the open data movement which has made great strides over the past decade. PLOS has a Data Availability policy, which was updated in 2014 to require that authors make publicly available the minimal dataset underlying an article&rsquo;s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think the timeliness concerns are related to the workforce crisis in peer review?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; I am answering this under the assumption that &lsquo;timeliness concerns&rsquo; refer to concerns about the timeliness of research publication, i.e. the time required for submissions to undergo peer review process. There are several factors that contribute to this, including difficulties securing peer reviewers who are suitable, willing, and available to contribute to the process. This could be improved by having increasingly effective tools to help editors find suitable reviewers, and by having peer review contributions formally recognized or even required by tenure and promotion committees and hiring managers. Reviewers for PLOS have the option of linking peer review contributions via their ORCID profiles in cases where they are willing to self-identify as reviewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: What are some ways to encourage the inclusion of a Limitations section in every paper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This could be encouraged through training and reinforcement. Institutions and established investigators could provide (or even require) research reporting training for early career researchers, and one aspect of this training could be to emphasize the importance of discussing limitations as a standard section within each research article. This training can then be reinforced through peer review: as part of their evaluation, reviewers and handling editors should consider whether a manuscript adequately addresses a study&rsquo;s limitations and assumptions, and request revisions to add or improve upon this where needed. If researchers themselves have been trained to recognize the importance of this section, they will look for it in the articles they evaluate as reviewers. Journals could also include a section on Limitations in their submission guidelines, but ultimately it will be the handling editors and reviewers who evaluate the scientific content of each submission and provide feedback on this type of reporting issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you feel that there needs to be more of an effort to educate/reinforce an understanding of the process of peer review to increase trust in results?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; To increase trust in results, it may be more effective to focus resources on (a) improving adoption of open data practices, (b) emphasizing the importance of critically evaluating primary research literature, (c) encouraging reproducibility efforts and publication of both confirmatory and contradictory results, and (d) ensuring that news articles and other public discussions accurately summarize the findings without over-hyping or overstating the study&rsquo;s results. Increasing awareness and understanding of peer review &ndash; including its strengths and limitations &ndash; may help by informing how the general audience approaches research reports. For example, this may help readers better appreciate the difference between peer-reviewed work that has been vetted by experts in the field and non-peer-reviewed articles (including pre-prints) that may not have been critically assessed before posting/publication.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Questions related to news and promotion:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think that journal press offices should proactively flag their (high-profile) retractions to journalists as well to ensure trust in science?</strong></p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p><b>A: Dave Knutson, Sr. Manager, Communications: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, but with a caveat: Only if the journal publicized the paper when it was originally published. They have a responsibility to correct the public record. However, for journals like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, publicly calling out every retraction would end up being white noise to the public. </span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: On what basis do journalists decide what topics to cover or publicize?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson::</strong> This may not seem satisfying, but it&rsquo;s years of honing one&rsquo;s news judgment. Journalists are constantly asking themselves: What does my audience need to know? And that question differs for every outlet. A reporter for the LA Times will answer that question differently than a journalist affiliated with the BBC. That said, here are some other considerations: Timeliness (is it happening now?), Progress (is it new?), Emotion (is there a human element?), Consequence (how many people will it affect/impact?), Proximity (is this a local story?), Conflict (are there differing opinions?) and is it unusual.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What do you think about the role that university press offices play in disseminating hyped up science?</strong></p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p><b>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Press officers have a key role in communicating science accurately. Research (for example, </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168217"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) suggests that when press releases contain &ldquo;hyping&rdquo; language &ndash; unwarranted casual claims, explicit health advice, and so on &ndash; subsequent news coverage is more likely also to contain these exaggerations. Meanwhile, inclusion of appropriate caveats and limitations in press releases is linked with their increased inclusion in news coverage. Since the more cautious, accurate press releases are not associated with reduced news coverage, there&rsquo;s no reason for press officers not to communicate with measured language and messages that we&rsquo;re confident will stand up to scrutiny &ndash; and that&rsquo;s certainly our aim at PLOS. Although university press officers in particular are under increasing pressure to &ldquo;market&rdquo; their institution and its research, I&rsquo;ve also found all those I work with to be dedicated to prioritizing communication that accurately reflects the science &ndash; which is as it should be.</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: Is there a difference between promoting preprints and promoting unpublished research presented at e.g. conferences?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager: </strong>Preprints and conference presentations are similar in that both may include research which has not (yet!) been peer-reviewed. Both are intended for an audience of researchers &ndash; for example, to share results early with colleagues &ndash; who are well-qualified to evaluate the science. At PLOS, we recommend against active promotion of either type of unpublished research, instead advising that authors and press officers wait until after peer review. The main difference between preprints and conference presentations in this respect is a practical one: while only conference attendees will see presentations, preprint servers are generally open to everyone, making it more likely that journalists will reach out to authors. We always recommend that if researchers choose to engage with such requests, they stress that their work is still undergoing peer review &ndash; and may be subject to change as a result.</p>



<h2><strong>Random questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: How can journal editors ensure that studies conducted in low resource contexts do not have author teams excluding local scientists? This erodes local trust</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson:</strong> We agree and last year announced this <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy </a>regarding inclusion in global research. You can also read this editorial in <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004099">PLOS Medicine</a></em>.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The effort to enhance access often doesn&rsquo;t get acknowledged or rewarded in the promotion/tenure process. Is that a barrier to the work you&rsquo;re trying to do?</strong></p>


      <div id="block-image-text--block_6345c226960b1" class=" block-image-text-wp-block-acf-image-text block-image-text block-image-text--left">

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p><b>A: Dan Morgan, Director of Communications and Community Relations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS, and any publisher or organization committed to Open Science and Open Access would love to see Open publishing and research practices acknowledged and rewarded more. That would certainly be a key driver in an activity (scholarly communication) driven by acknowledgement and progress. However, we also believe authors choose Open practices as a matter of scientific integrity, and not just reward, especially when they are minor behavioral shifts with meaningful reputational and scientific benefits. If authors believe there is an Open Science practice that is discouraged, or an Open Science practice that is not worth the effort UNLESS it is rewarded, we would love to hear about it so we can shine a light on the best ways the Open Science community can help!</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: What are your thoughts on single-blinded review processes? How can we ensure high quality and non conflicting peer-reviews?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team: </strong>PLOS uses a single-anonymized peer review model in which reviewers know authors&rsquo; identities by default, but reviewer identities remain hidden. We also offer reviewers the opportunity to sign their reviews if they wish to do so (about 18% choose to sign across all submissions and journals).</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen a single-anonymized review as our default (over double-anonymized) for several reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Hiding author identities prevents the disclosure of COIs, and its effectiveness at limiting bias in peer review is questionable, since studies suggest reviewers can guess the identities of authors (or think they can)</li><li>Research suggests that, in cases where double-anonymized peer review is optional, reviewers are more critical of authors who choose to conceal their identities&ndash;introducing perhaps a new form of bias</li><li>Single-anonymized review with the option to sign allows reviewers to provide an honest critique without fear of retribution, while at the same time giving them the flexibility to share their identity when they feel comfortable doing so</li></ul>



<p>We do not necessarily see conflicting or contradictory reviews as a bad thing. Indeed, gathering insight from different perspectives is one of the great benefits of having more than one expert reviewer. Such discrepancies can indicate that something in the article is open to interpretation and requires clarification, or they may result from differences in the reviewers&rsquo; specific expertise. Identifying and understanding these issues is valuable to the assessment and selection process. We ask our editors to take any differences in reviewer feedback into account during decision-making, and to indicate which changes they agree with and would expect to see in a revision.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing:</strong></h2>



<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank all of our panelists for sharing their expertise with us. It was a rich discussion, which led to a lot of thought provoking questions. We hope this debate continues far beyond Peer Review Week. Watch this space for updates on our collaboration with other publishers with regards to these issues as well as updates to our own policies.</p>

                <p>An ancient, armored worm may be the key to unraveling the evolutionary history of a diverse collection of marine invertebrates.</p>



<p>Discovered in China, a roughly 520-million-year-old fossil of the newly identified worm, dubbed <em>Wufengella</em>, might be the missing link between three of the phyla that constitute a cadre of sea creatures called lophophorates.</p>



<p>Based on a genetic analysis, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wufengella</em></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is probably the common ancestor</a> that connects brachiopods, bryozoans and phoronid worms, paleontologist Jakob Vinther and colleagues report September 27 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“We had been speculating that [the common ancestor] may have been some wormy animal that had plates on its back,” says Vinther, of the University of Bristol in England. “But we never had the animal.”</p>



<p>Roughly half a billion years ago, nearly all major animal groups burst onto the scene in a flurry of evolutionary diversification during what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Cambrian explosion</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>). During this time, lophophorates experienced a rapid growth of species, which has obscured the group’s evolutionary history.</p>

<p>One thing that ties together the different phyla of the group is their tentacle-like feeding tubes known as lophophores. But beyond that commonality, the phyla are all quite different. Brachiopods are shelled animals that at first glance resemble clams. Bryozoans — commonly known as moss animals — are microscopic sedentary critters that live in corallike colonies. And phoronids, or horseshoe worms, are unsegmented, soft-bodied creatures that live in stationary, tubelike structures. (More recently, some researchers have determined that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-oddball-invertebrate-finds-its-place-tree-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyoliths</a> — an extinct animal known by their conical shells (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>) — are also lophophorates because of the tentacled organ that surrounds their mouth.)</p>



<p><em>Wufengella</em> doesn’t belong to any of these phyla, Vinther and his colleagues found. But the critter has characteristics similar to those of brachiopods, horseshoe worms or bryozoans: a series of asymmetric, armored back plates, a wormlike body and bristles that stick out from lobes surrounding its body.</p>





<p>The fossil is a “great find,” says Gonzalo Giribet, an invertebrate zoologist at Harvard University who was not involved in the research. Still, the scientists’ analysis does not confirm that <em>Wufengella</em> is the long-sought missing link, he cautions, but rather suggests it.</p>



<p>Some researchers had hypothesized that lophophorates’ common ancestor would be a stationary creature that sat on the seafloor and fed only through tubes, similar to its modern kin. The <em>Wufengella</em> fossil could refute this idea; the animal’s body plan suggests instead that it crawled around, the researchers say.<a></a></p>



<p>A fossil like <em>Wufengella </em>had long been high on Vinther’s bucket list of fossils that he and his colleagues hoped to find. But “we always thought, ‘Well, we probably will never see that in real life,’” he says. Typically, such a creature would have spent its life in shallow water. Organisms don’t tend to preserve well there, decaying faster due to exposure to lots of oxygen. Vinther suggests that the <em>Wufengella</em> that his team found probably washed out to deep water in a storm.</p>



<p>Now that the researchers have found one <em>Wufengella</em>, they hope to find more, in part to see if there are other varieties. And perhaps the team could identify even more distant ancestors further back on the tree of life that might connect lophophorates with other animal groups such as mollusks, Vinther says, further fleshing out how life on Earth is connected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mesopotamia-city-marsh-islands-drone-lagash-iraq">Drone photos reveal an early Mesopotamian city made of marsh islands</a></h4>

              
                <p>A ground-penetrating eye in the sky has helped to rehydrate an ancient southern Mesopotamian city, tagging it as what amounted to a Venice of the Fertile Crescent. Identifying the watery nature of this early metropolis has important implications for how urban life flourished nearly 5,000 years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where modern-day Iraq lies.</p>



<p>Remote-sensing data, mostly gathered by a specially equipped drone, indicate that a vast urban settlement called Lagash largely consisted of four marsh islands connected by waterways, says anthropological archaeologist Emily Hammer of the University of Pennsylvania. These findings add crucial details to an emerging view that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2022.101458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southern Mesopotamian cities did not, as traditionally thought, expand outward from temple</a> and administrative districts into irrigated farmlands that were encircled by a single city wall, Hammer reports in the December <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>“There could have been multiple evolving ways for Lagash to be a city of marsh islands as human occupation and environmental change reshaped the landscape,” Hammer says.</p>



<p>Because Lagash had no geographical or ritual center, each city sector developed distinctive economic practices on an individual marsh island, much like the later Italian city of Venice, she suspects. For instance, waterways or canals crisscrossed one marsh island, where fishing and collection of reeds for construction may have predominated.</p>



<p>Two other Lagash marsh islands display evidence of having been bordered by gated walls that enclosed carefully laid out city streets and areas with large kilns, suggesting these sectors were built in stages and may have been the first to be settled. Crop growing and activities such as pottery making may have occurred there.</p>



<p>Drone photographs of what were probably harbors on each marsh island suggest that boat travel connected city sectors. Remains of what may have been footbridges appear in and adjacent to waterways between marsh islands, a possibility that further excavations can explore.</p>



<p>Lagash, which formed the core of one of the world’s earliest states, was founded between about 4,900 and 4,600 years ago. Residents abandoned the site, now known as Tell al-Hiba, around 3,600 years ago, past digs show. It was first excavated more than 40 years ago.</p>

<p>Previous analyses of the timing of ancient wetlands expansions in southern Iraq conducted by anthropological archaeologist Jennifer Pournelle of the University of South Carolina in Columbia indicated that Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities were built on raised mounds in marshes. Based on satellite images, archaeologist Elizabeth Stone of Stony Brook University in New York has proposed that Lagash consisted of around 33 marsh islands, many of them quite small.</p>



<p>Drone photos provided a more detailed look at Lagash’s buried structures than possible with satellite images, Hammer says. Guided by initial remote-sensing data gathered from ground level, a drone spent six weeks in 2019 taking high-resolution photographs of much of the site’s surface. Soil moisture and salt absorption from recent heavy rains helped the drone’s technology detect remnants of buildings, walls, streets, waterways and other city features buried near ground level.</p>



<p>Drone data enabled Hammer to narrow down densely inhabited parts of the ancient city to three islands, she says. A possibility exists that those islands were part of delta channels extending toward the Persian Gulf. A smaller, fourth island was dominated by a large temple.</p>



<p>Hammer’s drone probe of Lagash “confirms the idea of settled islands interconnected by watercourses,” says University of Chicago archaeologist Augusta McMahon, one of three co–field directors of ongoing excavations at the site.</p>



<p>Drone evidence of contrasting neighborhoods on different marsh islands, some looking planned and others more haphazardly arranged, reflect waves of immigration into Lagash between around 4,600 and 4,350 years ago, McMahon suggests. Excavated material indicates that new arrivals included residents of nearby and distant villages, mobile herders looking to settle down and slave laborers captured from neighboring city-states.</p>



<p>Dense clusters of residences and other buildings across much of Lagash suggest that tens of thousands of people lived there during its heyday, Hammer says. At that time, the city covered an estimated 4 to 6 square kilometers, nearly the area of Chicago.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dawn-city">northern Mesopotamian cities from around 6,000 years</a> ago, which were not located in marshes, contained separate city sectors (<em>SN: 2/5/08</em>). But Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities likely exploited water transport and trade among closely spaced settlements, enabling unprecedented growth, says archaeologist Guillermo Algaze of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Lagash stands out as an early southern Mesopotamian city frozen in time, Hammer says. Nearby cities continued to be inhabited for a thousand years or more after Lagash’s abandonment, when the region had become less watery and sectors of longer-lasting cities had expanded and merged. At Lagash, “we have a rare opportunity to see what other ancient cities in the region looked like earlier in time,” Hammer says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-mummies-fossils-paleontology">Dinosaur ‘mummies’ may not be rare flukes after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>It might be easier for dinosaurs to “mummify” than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Unhealed bite marks on fossilized dinosaur skin suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the animal’s carcass was scavenged before being covered in sediment</a>, researchers report October 12 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. The finding challenges the traditional view that burial very soon after death is required for dinosaur “mummies” to naturally form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new research centers on Dakota, an <em>Edmontosaurus</em> fossil unearthed in North Dakota in 1999. About 67 million years ago, Dakota was a roughly 12-meter-long, duck-billed dinosaur that ate plants. Today, Dakota’s fossilized limbs and tail still contain large areas of well-preserved, fossilized scaly skin, a striking example of dinosaur “mummification.”</p>





<p>The creature isn&#8217;t a true mummy because its skin has turned into rock, rather than being preserved as actual skin. Researchers have come to refer to such fossils with exquisitely preserved skin and other soft tissues as mummies.</p>



<p>In 2018, paleontologist Clint Boyd of the North Dakota Geological Survey in Bismarck and colleagues began a new phase of cleaning up and examining the dinosaur fossil. The team had found what looked like tears in the tail skin and puncture holes on the animal’s right front foot. To investigate what may have caused the skin marks, the researchers teamed up with Stephanie Drumheller, a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, to remove extra rocky material around the marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The holes in the skin — particularly those on the front limb — are a close match for bite wounds from prehistoric relatives of modern-day crocodiles, the researchers say. “This is the first time that’s been seen in dinosaurian soft tissues,” Drumheller says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the marks on the tail are larger than those on the front limb, the team thinks that at least two carnivores munched on the <em>Edmontosaurus</em> carcass, probably as scavengers because the wounds didn&#8217;t heal. But scavenging doesn’t fit into the traditional view of mummification.</p>



<p>“This assumption of rapid burial has been baked into the explanation for mummies for a while,” Drumheller says. That clearly wasn’t the case for Dakota. If scavengers had enough time to snack on its body, then the deceased dino had been out in the open for a while.</p>



<p>Observing Dakota’s deflated skin envelope, shrink-wrapped to the underlying bone with no muscle or other organs, Drumheller had an unexpected “eureka moment,” she says. “I had seen something like this before. It just wasn&#8217;t in the paleontological literature. It was in the forensics literature.”</p>



<p>When some smaller modern scavengers like raccoons feed on the internal organs of a larger carcass, the scavengers rip open the carcass’s body. The forensics research showed that this hole gives any gasses and fluids from further decomposition an escape route, allowing the remaining skin to dry out. Burial could happen afterward.</p>



<p>The researchers “make a very good point,” says Raymond Rogers, a researcher at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., who studies how organisms decay and fossilize and wasn&#8217;t involved in the research. “It would be very unlikely for a carcass to achieve advanced stages of desiccation and also experience rapid burial. These two generally presumed prerequisites for mummification seem to be somewhat incompatible.”</p>



<p>Fossilization of soft tissues — like skin or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ancient-horseshoe-crab-brain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fleshy-comb-first-found-dinosaur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fleshy head combs</a> — is uncommon, but not unheard of (<em>SN: 8/20/21</em>; <em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).&nbsp;“If [soft tissue] requires some spectacular confluence of weird events to get it fossilized at all, it&#8217;s far more common than then you would expect if that was the case,” Drumheller says. Perhaps, then, mummies originating from common carcass fates could explain this.</p>



<p>But while dry, “jerkylike” skin could survive long enough to be buried, the conditions involved aren’t necessarily common, says Evan Thomas Saitta, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>“I still suspect that this actual process is a very precise sequence of events, where if you get the timing wrong, you end up without a mummy dinosaur,” he says.</p>



<p>Understanding that sequence of events, and just how common it is, requires figuring out how fossilization proceeds after a mummy’s burial. This is an area of research that Boyd says he’s interested in looking into next.</p>



<p>“Is it just the same fossilization process as for the bones?” he asks. “Or do we also need a different set of geochemical conditions to then fossilize the skin?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-nerve-cell-rat-brain-organoi">Clumps of human nerve cells thrived in rat brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>To coax human nerve cells in a laboratory to thrive, there are three magic words: location, location, location.</p>



<p>Many experiments grow human nerve cells in lab dishes. But a new study enlists some real estate that’s a bit more unconventional: the brain of a rat. Implanted clusters of human <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05277-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurons grow bigger and more complex</a> than their cohorts grown in dishes, researchers report online October 12 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the human cells also appear functional, albeit in very limited ways. The implanted human cells can both receive signals from rat cells and influence the rats’ behavior, connections that “demonstrate more substantial integration of the transplanted neurons,” says Arnold Kriegstein, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is a significant advance.”</p>





<p>Over the last decade, scientists have been building increasingly complex brain organoids, 3-D clusters of cells derived from stem cells that grow and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-build-human-brain">mimic the human brain</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/18</em>). These organoids don’t re-create the full complexity of human neurons that develop in an actual brain. But they can be windows into an otherwise inscrutable process — human brain development, and how it can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-human-organoids-personalized-cluster-cells-study-disorders">go awry</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/21</em>). “Even if they’re not entirely perfect, [these models] are surrogates for human cells in a way that animal cells are not,” Kriegstein says. “And that’s really exciting.”</p>



<p>To push these cells closer to their full potential, Sergiu Pasca, a neuroscientist at the Stanford School of Medicine, and colleagues surgically implanted human cerebral organoids into the brains of newborn rat pups. Along with their hosts, the human organoids began to grow. Three months later, the organoids were about nine times their starting volume, ultimately making up about a third of one side of the rat’s cortex, the outer layer of the brain. “It pushes the rat cells aside,” Pasca says. “It grows as a unit.”</p>



<p>These human cells flourished because rats’ brains offer perks that lab dishes can’t, such as blood supply, a precise mix of nutrients and stimulation from nearby cells. This environmental support coaxed individual human neurons to grow bigger — six times as large by one measure — than the same sort of cells grown in dishes. Cells grown in the rat brains were also more complex, with more elaborate branching patterns and more cell connections called synapses.</p>

<p>The cells looked more mature, but Pasca and his colleagues wanted to know if the neurons would behave that way, too. Tests of electrical properties showed that implanted neurons behaved more similarly to cells that develop in human brains than cells grown in dishes.</p>



<p>Over months of growth, these human neurons made connections with their rat host cells. The human organoids were implanted in the somatosensory cortex, a part of the rat brain that handles whisker input. When researchers puffed air at the whiskers, some of the human cells responded.</p>



<p>What’s more, the human cells could influence the behavior of the rat. In further experiments, the researchers genetically tweaked the organoids to respond to blue light. Prompted by a flash of light, the neurons fired signals, and researchers rewarded the rats with water. Soon, the rats learned to move to the water spout when their human organoid cells sent signals.</p>



<p>In behavioral tests, rats with human implants didn’t show signs of higher intelligence or memory; in fact, researchers were more concerned with deficits. The human organoids were nudging out their hosts’ brains, after all. “Will there be memory deficits? Will there be motor deficits? Will there be seizures?” Pasca asked. But after extensive tests, including behavior tests, EEGs and MRIs, “we could not find differences,” Pasca says.<br><br>Other experiments included nerve cells from people with a genetic disorder called Timothy syndrome, a severe developmental disorder that affects brain growth. Growing organoids created with these patients’ cells in rats’ brains might reveal differences that other techniques would not, the researchers reasoned. Sure enough, neurons in these organoids had less complex message-receiving dendrites than those from organoids derived from people without the syndrome.</p>



<p>Organoids made from patient-specific cells could one day even serve as test subjects for treatments, Pasca says. “Challenging disorders will require bold approaches,” he says. “We will need to build human models that recapitulate more aspects of the human brain to study these uniquely human conditions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">NASA’s DART mission successfully shoved an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>It worked! Humanity has, for the first time, purposely moved a celestial object.</p>



<p>As a test of a potential asteroid-deflection scheme, NASA’s DART spacecraft shortened the orbit of asteroid Dimorphos by 32 minutes — a far greater change than astronomers expected.</p>



<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">rammed into the tiny asteroid</a> at about 22,500 kilometers per hour on September 26 (<em>SN: 9/26/22</em>). The goal was to move Dimorphos slightly closer to the larger asteroid it orbits, Didymos.</p>





<p>Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose any threat to Earth. DART’s mission was to help scientists figure out if a similar impact could nudge a potentially hazardous asteroid out of harm’s way before it hits our planet.</p>



<p>The experiment was a smashing success. Before the impact, Dimorphos orbited Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroid-s-motion-in-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the orbit was 11 hours and 23 minutes</a>, NASA announced October 11 in a news briefing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="334" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101122_LG_DART_inline-1.gif" alt="A gif of two asteroids, one of which was hit by a spacecraft to change its orbit." class="wp-image-3118281" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118281">A small spacecraft called LICIACube, short for Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, detached from DART just before impact, then buzzed the two asteroids to get a closeup view of the cosmic smashup. Starting from about 700 kilometers away, this series of images captures a bright plume of debris erupting from Dimorphos (right in the first half of this gif), evidence of the impact that shortened its orbit around Didymos (left). At closest approach, LICIACube was about 59 kilometers from the asteroids.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118281">ASI, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For the first time ever, humanity has changed the orbit of a planetary body,” said NASA planetary science division director Lori Glaze.</p>



<p>Four telescopes in Chile and South Africa observed the asteroids every night after the impact. The telescopes can’t see the asteroids separately, but they can detect periodic changes in brightness as the asteroids eclipse each other. All four telescopes saw eclipses consistent with an 11-hour, 23-minute orbit. The result was confirmed by two planetary radar facilities, which bounced radio waves off the asteroids to measure their orbits directly, said Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>The minimum change for the DART team to declare success was 73 seconds — a hurdle the mission overshot by more than 30 minutes. The team thinks the spectacular plume of debris that the impactor kicked up gave the mission extra oomph. The impact itself gave some momentum to the asteroid, but the debris flying off in the other direction pushed it even more — like a temporary rocket engine.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting and promising result for planetary defense,” Chabot said. But the change in orbital period was just 4 percent. “It just gave it a small nudge,” she said. So knowing an asteroid is coming is crucial to future success. For something similar to work on an asteroid headed for Earth, “you’d want to do it years in advance,” Chabot said. An upcoming space telescope called <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/near-earth-object-surveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Near-Earth Object Surveyor</a> is one of many projects intended to give that early warning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy">The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac90ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, </a>&nbsp;astronomers report in the Oct. 1<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.</p>





<p>Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723</a>, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.</p>



<p>For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/globular-star-cluster-surprising-few-heavy-elements">wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters</a>, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (<em>SN: 10/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">cosmic dawn</a>,” when stars were first able to form at all (<em>SN: 3/4/22</em>)?</p>



<p>Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg" alt="galaxy cluster SMACS 0723" class="wp-image-3118215" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-585x383.jpg 585w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-284x186.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118215">Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler.

Mowla <em>et al</em>/<em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.</p>



<p>“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.</p>



<p>In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.</p>



<p>Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.</p>



<p>Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nikon-small-world-photography-2022">A glimpse inside a gecko’s hand won the 2022 Nikon Small World photo contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life is beautiful at all scales, from big to small. Sometimes that splendor is concealed beneath literal scales.</p>



<p>A mesmerizing peek below the developing scales on the hand of an embryonic Madagascar giant day gecko (<em>Phelsuma grandis</em>) won first place in <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2022 Nikon Small World photomicrography competition</a>. The winning image, stitched together from hundreds of images taken over two days with a confocal microscope, was crafted by University of Geneva researchers Grigorii Timin and Michel Milinkovitch. The pair study the genetics and physics of embryonic development.</p>



<p>The hand is artificially colored to show budding nerves in cyan and structures containing collagen in a range of oranges and yellows. Collagen is a building block of life, says Milinkovitch. Knowing where collagen is can help researchers better understand how bodies and tissues develop.</p>

<p>Parts of bones that have started to calcify shine brightest in the image, Timin says. Developing tendons and ligaments stretch as orange branches. Blood cells form clusters or line up inside new blood vessels at the tips of the gecko’s digits.</p>





<p>The image highlights beauty of all sizes, Milinkovitch says. The snapshot is “beautiful as a hand, you see this beautiful pattern of the fingers. Then you zoom, you see the spongy bones. And you zoom, you see the tendons. And you zoom, and you see the fibers that’s from the tendons. Then you zoom, and you see the blood cells.”</p>



<p>The gecko photo is one of 92 incredible images recognized in this year’s competition. The winners of the 48th annual contest <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were announced</a> October 12.

<h3>Got milk?</h3>

<p>From a distance this photograph may look like a cluster of grapes. But each orb is a sprawling clump of cells inside breast tissue. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer immunologist Caleb Dawson of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia, took thousands of images using a confocal microscope to view tiny, musclelike cells that wrap around milk-producing spheres. He used dyes and antibodies to mark the cells yellow and magenta in this second-place-winning image.</p>



<p>The cells respond to the hormone oxytocin, Dawson says. Oxytocin is released during breastfeeding and helps squeeze milk out of the spheres, called alveoli. Such images of lactating breast tissue can help researchers figure out how immune cells keep breast tissue and the babies it can feed healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Snuffed candle</h3>

<p>Ole Bielfeldt had to be quick to capture the last gasp of an extinguished candle.</p>



<p>Candle wax is made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, which turn mostly into carbon dioxide when lit on fire. But not all those hydrocarbons burn, instead accumulating as soot on surfaces close to the candle. “When the flame goes out, the glowing wick has enough heat left to break up the wax molecules for a while, but not enough to burn the carbon,” says Bielfeldt, a photographer in Cologne, Germany. “So you get a trail of smoke until it cools.”</p>



<p>Using a fast shutter speed and a bright LED light, Bielfeldt managed to capture those unburned particles of carbon drifting away, earning sixth place.</p>



<h3>Iridescent slime mold</h3>

<p>Hidden on leaves and decaying logs in moist forests are minuscule works of art like these <em>Lamproderma </em>slime molds.</p>



<p>In the dappled sun of an October day, photographer Alison Pollack of San Anselmo, Calif., saw a sparkly leaf as she was digging through a leaf pile. After taking the leaf home and looking through a microscope, she was transfixed by the crinkly heads and iridescence of slime mold. Around 40 hours of work and 147 combined images later, Pollack had captured a striking snapshot that she likes to anthropomorphize as a nurturing relationship: parent and child, two lovers, or brother and sister. The photo earned fifth place in the contest.</p>



<p>Most slime molds have smooth heads, which release spores into the environment to reproduce. This pair may have dried too fast, stunting their development and leaving their heads wrinkly, Pollack says. But that’s OK, “because the texture to me is just gorgeous.”</p>



<h3>A deadly predator</h3>

<p>All fear the predacious tiger beetle, especially this poor fly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murat Öztürk of Ankara, Turkey, nabbed 10th place in this year’s competition with an astounding — and unnerving — snapshot of a tiger beetle using its mandibles to crush a fly by its eyes.</p>



<p>Tiger beetles (<em>Cicindelinae</em>) sprint after their prey so quickly that the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1998/01/tiger-beetles-go-blind-chasing-prey-high-speeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insects go temporarily blind</a>. The photographed beetle would have stopped multiple times to orient itself to figure out where the fly was, eventually snatching its meal. Thanks to the beetle’s strong and sharp jaws, “the chances of survival of the creatures caught by this insect are very low,” Öztürk says. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Lewis/Queensland University of Technology, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Opal Reef off the coast of Australia, some cauliflower coral (<em>Pocillopora verrucosa</em>) polyps appear green. But the same organism is transformed when viewed under a microscope in the lab.</p>



<p>To reveal the polyp’s individual cells, marine scientist Brett Lewis of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, stitched together more than 60 images taken over 36 hours. The coral naturally fluoresces a medley of blues, purples and pinks when exposed to different wavelengths of light. Algae living inside the polyp appear orange or pink, while the coral’s tissues shine blue. The image won 12th place in the competition.</p>



<p>One amazing thing about the photo, Lewis says, is that in some areas, algal cells shine through a light blue haze. That’s because coral tissue is transparent; algae give coral its color.</p>



<p>Peeks of coral’s internal makings can help scientists understand its biology, Lewis says. His work, for instance, aims to figure out how young polyps build strong foundations when they attach to a surface — an important step in building or restoring coral reefs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-swimming-groups-effectiveness-fertility">Cooperative sperm outrun loners in the mating race</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even sperm gotta stick together.</p>



<p>Bull sperm swim more effectively when in clusters, a new study shows, potentially offering insight into fertility in humans. In simulated reproductive tracts of animals like cattle and humans, the behavior increases the chances that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.961623/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groups of cooperative bovine sperm will outpace meandering loners</a> as they race to fertilize a female egg cell, physicist Chih-kuan Tung and colleagues report September 22 in <em>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The benefits of clustering don’t come down to flat-out speed. “They are not faster,” says Tung, of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro. “In terms of speed, they are comparable or slower” than sperm traveling alone. Like the sperm equivalent of herds of tortoises racing individual hares, the winners are not necessarily the swiftest but rather the ones that can stay on target.</p>





<p>On their own, sperm tend to follow curved paths — which is a problem, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But when sperm gather in groups of two or more, they swim along straighter routes. It’s behavior that a couple of the same researchers noted in a previous study where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-feather-sperm-flock-together">they tracked sperm swimming in stationary fluids</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/16</em>). Although that might give sperm clusters an advantage, it would only help if they happen to be going the right direction. Other benefits of sperm clustering weren’t clear until the researchers developed an experimental setup that introduced flowing fluid into their experiments.</p>



<p>In creatures like humans and cattle, sperm make their way to the ovum by swimming against a current of mucus that streams through the cervix and away from the uterus. It’s difficult to study what benefits clustering might confer while swimming upstream inside living beings. So Tung and colleagues created an analog in their lab: a shallow, narrow, 4-centimeter-long channel filled with a thick fluid that mimics natural mucus and flows at rates the researchers could control.</p>



<p>Whether alone or in groups, sperm naturally tend to swim upstream. However, clusters of sperm in the experiment did a better job heading upstream into the mucus flow, while individual sperm were more likely to head off in other directions. Despite the speedier travels of some individual sperm, a poorer ability to point upstream hampered the progress of sperm loners compared with slower moving clusters.</p>

</div><figcaption>In a thick, mucuslike fluid flowing from left to right, clusters of sperm travel more consistently against the flow than individual sperm do on their own.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clusters also stayed the course in the face of rapidly flowing mucus. When the researchers turned up the flow in their apparatus, many individual sperm were washed away. Sperm clusters were much less likely to get swept downstream.</p>



<p>While sperm in the study were bovine, the advantages of clustering should also apply to human sperm, Tung says. Sperm of both species have similar dimensions. The swimmers typically compete to fertilize a single ovum. And unlike pigs or other animals where semen is deposited directly in the uterus, both human and bovine sperm start out in the vagina and travel through the cervix to get to the uterus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying sperm in fluids that closely resemble the flowing mucus in reproductive tracts could reveal problems that don’t turn up in conventional observations of sperm swimming in stationary fluids, Tung says. “One hope is that this sort of knowledge can help us do better diagnoses” to provide clues to understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-show-age">infertility in humans</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/03</em>).</p>



<p>Subjecting sperm to realistic settings in the lab may soon offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">practical help for people who have trouble conceiving</a>, says fertility researcher Christopher Barratt of the University of Dundee in Scotland, who was not affiliated with the study (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>“How a sperm cell responds to its surroundings and how that may change its behavior is a very important subject,” Barratt says. “This type of technology could be used, or adapted, to select better quality sperm,” for people in need of fertility assistance. “That would be a very big deal.”</p>

                <p><strong>Selected paper:</strong> <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276">Calaim, Dehmelt, Gonçalves and Machens, The geometry of robustness in spiking neural networks, eLife (2022)</a></p>



<p><strong>The main message:</strong> This theoretical neuroscience paper describes an intuitive way how to think about the effect of single spikes in a network where the output and its error is closely monitored and used as feedback. This intuition is best illustrated by the video below. The video shows how the activity of a network tries to trace a target (in this case a sinus wave). Each neuron defines a boundary (the differently colored lines in the video in the 2D case). If the output of the network exceeds one such boundary surface, a corrective spike of the respective neuron is emitted. The signal is therefore kept in the target zone by being bounced back once it becomes incorrect. This enables us for example to think about cases where single neurons are perturbed &#8211; when they are excited, inhibited or when they die &#8211; in an intuitive and geometric way in terms of single spikes.</p>

<p><strong>The strong points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This visualization of the spiking dynamics in a neuronal network makes several points intuitively clear. For example, why such networks are robust to deletion or inhibition but not excitation of a single neuron (this is illustrated by deformations of the bounding box).<br /></li>



<li>More generally, the visualization makes it intuitive how neurons might be able to cooperate when taking advantage of such specific and fast feedback loops.<br /></li>



<li>This sort of simulated network tends to produce unphysiological or at least undesired behavior (discussed as &#8220;ping-pong&#8221; effect in the paper). This behavior becomes quite apparent and understandable due to the intuitive visualization.<br /></li>



<li>Finally, it is simply really cool to use this visualization tool and to think about redundant neurons as those neurons where the boundary surfaces in this bounding box have similar locations/orientations.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The weak points:</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>The first weak point is that the presentation, despite the nice and intuitive video above, does not seem, from my perspective, accessible for everybody. Here, the task of the presented network is to approximate an externally supplied function (e.g., a sinus function). While many other neuroscientists, also many theoretical neuroscientists, think about neuronal networks as devices to represent information and to transform it, this paper therefore rather aims for a &#8220;control&#8221; approach. In my opinion, it is reasonable to think about the brain as a control device (to control the environment), but I feel that many readers might be already lost because they don&#8217;t understand why such an approach is taken. Only when reading the related work by the group (for an introduction, check out <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Boerlin et al.</a>, PLoS Comp Biol (2013) or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Denève and Machens</a>, Nat Neuro (2016)), one understands that this property of function approximation could also be a useful model of normal operation of the brain, where the task is to react towards the environment and not to approximate a god-given function. I feel that the authors introduce their idea not in an ideal way to reach a broader audience, especially since I the general idea could in principle be understood by a broader audience.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>It is not clear how the intuition about the effect of single spikes and the target zone in the bounding box would translate to other network architectures that do not follow the rather specific designs. These network designs were described in previous work by <a href="https://machenslab.org/">Christian Machens</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&amp;user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Sophie Denève</a> and feature a specific excitatory/inhibitory connectivity. A core feature of such networks is that the voltages of neurons are largely synchronized but their spiking is not, resulting in a seemingly asynchronous firing regime as found in the cortex, despite redundancy at the voltage behavior of single neurons.<br />This limitation also came up during the review process. The authors try to discuss these questions in detail and to address some of them, as much as possible, with additional analyses and models. Check out <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276#sa1">the open reviews</a> (which are always accessible for eLife papers)!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I like the paper because it comes up with a surprising, new and maybe even useful idea. It attempts to think about the consequences and circumstances of a single neuron&#8217;s spike, and how the effect of this single spike on other neurons can be understood. As a caveat, all these intuitions come with the assumption that there is a closely monitored error of the output signal, which in turn is fed back into the system in a very precise manner. This assumption might seem very strong in the beginning. However, in order to understand things, we have to make some assumptions, and even from wrong assumptions, we might be able to develop first intuitions about what is going on. I would be curious whether and how this bounding box picture could be applied to other network architectures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tua-tagovailoa-concussion-traumatic-brain-injury-head-hit-risk">Why traumatic brain injuries raise the risk of a second, worse hit</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a football game on September 25, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa got the pass off but he got knocked down. Fans watched him shake his head and stumble to the ground as he tried to jog it off. After a medical check, he went back into the game against the Buffalo Bills with what his coach later said was a back injury.</p>



<p>Four days later, in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Tagovailoa, 24, got hit again. This time, he left the field on a stretcher with what was later diagnosed as a concussion.</p>





<p>Many observers suspect that the first hit — given Tagovailoa’s subsequent headshaking and wobbliness — left the athlete with a concussion, also called a mild traumatic brain injury. If those were indeed signs of a head injury, that first hit may have lined him up for an even worse brain injury just days later.</p>



<p>“The science tells us that yes, a person who is still recovering from a concussion is at an elevated risk for sustaining another concussion,” says Kristen Dams-O’Connor, a neuropsychologist and director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. As one example, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a concussion roughly doubled the chance of a second one</a> among young Swedish men, researchers reported in 2013 in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“This, I think, was avoidable,” Dams-O’Connor says of Tagovailoa’s brain injury in the game against the Bengals.</p>



<p>After a hit to the head, when the soft brain hits the unyielding skull, the injury kicks off a cascade of changes. Some nerve cells become overactive, inflammation sets in, and blood flow is altered. These downstream events in the brain — and how they relate to concussion symptoms — can happen over hours and days, and are not easy to quickly measure, Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>That makes diagnosing a concussion tricky. Clinicians often have to rely on patients saying they feel off or fuzzy. Professional athletes might not be eager to share those symptoms if it means they’ll be sidelined. “These are elite athletes who are conditioned to suck it up,” Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>Other signs can indicate a concussion, such as a person’s gait or pupil dilation. “As clinicians, we are often triangulating multiple sources of information to make that call — was this or was this not a concussion?” Dams-O’Connor says. The scientific uncertainty in that call should lead clinicians to err on the side of caution, she says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;After a traumatic brain injury, recuperation is crucial. “It’s much worse when an individual isn’t given the proper time to rest and recover and gets a second impact in a close period of time,” says Daniel Daneshvar, a brain injury medicine doctor and neuroscientist at Mass General Brigham in Boston and Harvard Medical School. Looking at the brains of mice after two close-together hits, researchers have seen signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-study-offers-clues-brains-response-concussions">worse damage and a longer recovery</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/16</em>).</p>



<p>For athletes, that vulnerability comes in part from concussion symptoms themselves. Slowed reaction times, dizziness and double vision confound a quick-moving quarterback who needs to dodge tackles and see opponents coming from the side. Those symptoms can lead to further injury to the head — and to the rest of the body. A concussion <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9402462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases the risks</a> of lower extremity injuries, according to a recent analysis of National Football League players published in August in <em>Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, a healing brain is more susceptible to jarring. While the brain is still recovering in the weeks after an injury, “your threshold for getting a concussion is lower,” Daneshvar says. A lighter hit, researchers suspect, can do more damage. A rare condition called second impact syndrome illustrates an extreme outcome of successive brain injuries. This catastrophic, often fatal brain swelling happens when a still-healing brain is hit again.</p>



<p>That’s not what happened to Tagovailoa. But two concussions close together can delay recovery, Dams-O’Connor emphasizes. “I think people minimize how life-altering that can be.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced that they are jointly investigating whether their concussion protocols were followed in this case. Tagovailoa may have been allowed back into that first game because his stumbling was attributed — correctly or not — to a back injury, not a brain injury. The NFL and NFLPA are considering changing the protocol to keep a player out of a game for any obvious motor instability, regardless of cause.</p>



<p>For now, Tagovailoa is moving through the stages of recovery outlined in the concussion protocol. In a social media post on September 30, Tagovailoa <a href="https://twitter.com/Tua/status/1575961296423784449/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanked</a> his team, friends and family and everyone who has reached out in support. “I’m feeling much better and focused on recovering so I can get back out on the field with my teammates,” he wrote.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fishers-tree-climbing-carnivores-washington-forest">Tree-climbing carnivores called fishers are back in Washington’s forests</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Holding an antenna above his head, Jeff Lewis crept through an evergreen forest in the Cascade mountains, southeast of Seattle. As he navigated fallen fir logs and dripping ferns, he heard it: a faint “beep” from a radio transmitter implanted in an animal code-named F023.</p>



<p>F023 is a fisher (<em>Pekania pennanti</em>), an elusive member of the weasel family that Lewis fondly describes as a “tree wolverine.” Resembling a cross between a cat and an otter, these sleek carnivores hunt in forests in Canada and parts of the northern United States. But fur trapping and habitat loss had wiped out Washington’s population by the mid-1900s.</p>





<p>Back in 2017 when Lewis was keeping tabs on F023, he tracked her radio signal from a plane two or three times a month, along with dozens of other recently released fishers. Come spring, he noticed that F023’s behavior was different from the others.</p>



<p>Her locations had been clustered close together for a few weeks, a sign that she might be “busy with babies,” says Lewis, a conservation biologist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. He and colleagues trekked into the woods to see if she had indeed given birth. If so, it would be the first wild-born fisher documented in the Cascades in at least half a century.</p>



<p>As the faint beeps grew louder, the biologists found a clump of fur snagged on a branch, scratch marks in the bark and — the best clue of all — fisher scat. The team rigged motion-detecting cameras to surrounding trees. A few days later, after sifting through hundreds of images of squirrels and deer, the team hit the jackpot: a grainy photo of F023 ferrying a kit down from her den high in a hemlock tree. The scientists were ecstatic.</p>



<p>“We’re all a bunch of little kids when it comes to getting photos like that,” Lewis says.</p>





<h4>Chasing babies</h4>



<p>This notable birth came during the second phase of a 14-year fisher reintroduction effort. After 90 fishers were released in Olympic National Park from 2008 to 2010, the project turned its focus east of Seattle, relocating 81 fishers in the South Cascades (home to Mount Rainier National Park) from 2015 to 2020, and then 89 fishers in the North Cascades from 2018 to 2020. The animals were brought in from British Columbia and Alberta. The project concluded last year, when researchers let loose the final batch of fishers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Three forests</h3>



<p>Washington’s fisher recovery efforts relocated the animals to three regions of the state: the Olympic Peninsula west of Seattle and the North and South Cascades, a mountain range separated by Interstate 90.</p>

<p>Baby animals are the key measure of success for a wildlife reintroduction project. As part of Washington’s Fisher Recovery Plan, biologists set out to document newborn kits as an indicator of how fishers were faring in the three relocation regions.</p>



<p>Before F023’s kit was caught on camera in May 2017, biologists had already confirmed births by seven relocated females on the Olympic Peninsula, where the whole project began. Two of the seven females had four kits, “the largest litter size ever documented on the West Coast,” says Patti Happe, wildlife branch chief at Olympic National Park. Most females have one to three kits.</p>



<p>Lewis is often asked, why put all of this effort into restoring a critter many people have never heard of? His answer: A full array of carnivores makes the ecosystem more resilient.</p>



<p>Happe admits to another motive: “They’re freaking adorable — that’s partly why we’re saving them.”</p>

<h4>The missing piece</h4>



<p>Contrary to their name, fishers don’t hunt fish, though they’ll happily munch on a dead one if it’s handy. They mainly prey on small mammals, but they also eat reptiles, amphibians, insects, fruit and carrion. About a meter long, males weigh up to six kilograms, about twice as much as females. Fun facts: Females raise young high above the forest floor in hollowed-out spaces in tree trunks. Fishers can travel face-first down tree trunks by turning their hind feet 180 degrees. They have wickedly sharp teeth and partially retractable claws. And they’re incredibly agile, leaping up to two meters between branches and traveling as much as 30 kilometers in a day.</p>



<p>Fishers’ stubby legs and unique climbing skills make them a threat to tree-climbing porcupines. It isn’t pretty: A fisher will force the quill-covered animal down a tree and attack its face until it dies from blood loss or shock. Then the fisher neatly skins the prickly prey, eating most everything except the quills and bones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="539" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3.jpg" alt="two camera trap photos showing female fisher F105 carrying one of her four kits down from her tree den to the ground" class="wp-image-3118168" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-483x383.jpg 483w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-568x450.jpg 568w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-235x186.jpg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118168">These camera trap photos, taken in April 2021, show female fisher F105 carrying one of her four kits down from her tree den near Lake Wenatchee in the North Cascades.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118168">NPS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But these fearsome predators were no match for humans. In the 1800s, trappers began targeting fishers for their fur. Soft and luxuriant, the glossy brown-gold pelts were coveted fashion accessories, selling for as much as $345 each in the 1920s. This demand meant fishers disappeared not only from Washington, but from more than a dozen states across the northern United States. Once fisher populations plummeted, porcupines ran rampant across the Great Lakes region and New England. This wreaked havoc on forests because the porcupines gobbled up tree seedlings.</p>



<p>Hoping to keep porcupine populations in check, private timber companies partnered with state agencies to bring fishers back to several states in the 1950s and 1960s. Thanks to these efforts and stricter trapping regulations, fishers are once again abundant in Michigan, Wisconsin, New York and Massachusetts.</p>



<p>But in Washington, like most of the West, fisher numbers were still slim. By the turn of the 21st century, no fisher had been sighted in the state for over three decades.</p>



<p>As in the Midwest and New England, private timber companies in Washington supported bringing back fishers. Although porcupines are uncommon in Washington, mountain beavers — a large, primitive rodent endemic to the Pacific Northwest — fill a similar role in Washington’s evergreen forests: They eat tree seedlings. And fishers eat them.</p>



<p>By 2006, the state hatched a plan to bring the animals in from Canada. “It was a big opportunity to restore a species,” Lewis says. “We can fix this.”</p>

<h4>A new home</h4>



<p>Like the other Canadian fishers moved to Washington, F023’s relocation story began when she walked into a box trap in British Columbia, lured by a tasty morsel of meat. The bait had been set by local trappers hired by Conservation Northwest, a nonprofit that is one of the recovery project’s three main partners, along with Washington Fish and Wildlife and the National Park Service. After veterinarians checked her health and administered vaccines and antiparasitics to help her survive in her new home, F023 received a surgically implanted radio transmitter and was driven across the border.</p>



<p>She was met by members of the fisher recovery team, who released her just south of Mount Rainier National Park. The forest’s towering Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock trees were full of cubby holes and cavities to hide in, and the undergrowth held plenty of small mammals to eat. At the release, upward of 150 people gathered around F023’s box, part of the team’s effort to engage the public in championing fisher recovery. Everyone cheered as a child opened the door and the furry female bounded into the snowy woods, out of sight in a flash.</p>



<p>The team monitored each relocated fisher for up to two years to see if the project met key benchmarks of success in each of the three regions: more than 50 percent of the fishers surviving their first year, at least half establishing a home range near the release site, and a confirmed kit born to at least one female.</p>



<p>“We met those marks,” says Dave Werntz, science and conservation director at Conservation Northwest.</p>



<p>The effort may have been aided by a series of bypasses built over and under a roughly 25-kilometer stretch of Interstate 90 east of Seattle. One of these structures is the largest wildlife bridge in North America, an overpass “paved” with forest. In 2020, a remote camera caught an image of what looks like a fisher moving through one of the underpasses.</p>

OF TRANSPORTATION</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Male fishers go on these huge walkabouts to find females,” Werntz says. While biologists assumed fishers would cross the freeway to search for mates, having photographic proof “is pretty wonderful,” he says.</p>



<p>Happe and others hope to also see wildlife crossings along Interstate 5 one day. The freeway, which runs north-south near the coast, is the main obstacle keeping the Olympic and Cascade populations apart, she says. “We’re all working on wildlife travel corridors and connectivity in hopes the two populations hook up.”</p>



<h4>Learning curve</h4>



<p>The majority of the initial 90 fishers relocated to the Olympic Peninsula settled nicely into their new homes, according to radio tracking. In the year following release in that location, <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.22192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fisher survival rate averaged 73 percent</a>, but varied based on the year and season they were released, as well as sex and age of the fishers.</p>



<p>Males fared better than females: Seventy-four percent of recorded deaths were of females, partly because they are smaller and more vulnerable to predators, such as bobcats and coyotes. Of 24 recovered carcasses where <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358083667_Post-release_survival_of_translocated_fishers_implications_for_translocation_success" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause of death could be determined</a>, 14 were killed by predators, seven were struck by vehicles, two drowned and one died in a leg-hold trap, Lewis, Happe and colleagues reported in the April 2022 <em>Journal of Wildlife Management</em>.</p>



<p>Because the first fishers relocated to the Olympic Peninsula were released in several locations, the animals had trouble finding mates. As a result, only a few parents sired the subsequent generations.</p>



<p>The researchers became concerned when they looked at the genetic diversity of fishers on the Olympic Peninsula six years post-relocation. Happe and colleagues set up 788 remote cameras and hair-snare stations: triangular cubbies open on either end with a chicken leg as bait in the middle and wire brushes protruding from either side to grab strands of fur. DNA analysis of the fur <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.21788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised red flags about inbreeding</a>, Happe and Lewis say.</p>



<p>“Models showed we were going to lose up to 50 percent of genetic diversity, and the population would wink out in something like 100 years,” Happe says. To expand the gene pool, the team brought 20 more fishers to the Olympic Peninsula in 2021. These animals came from Alberta whereas the founding population had hailed from British Columbia.</p>

<p>As the reintroduction effort moved into the Cascades, the team adapted, based on lessons learned from the Olympic Peninsula. For instance, to increase the likelihood of fishers finding each other more quickly, the animals were released at fewer sites that were closer together. The team also released the animals before January, giving females ample time to settle into a home range before the spring mating and birthing season.</p>



<h4>Finding their food</h4>



<p>As the experiment went on, more unanticipated findings popped up. Fishers released in the southern part of the Cascades <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/673301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were more likely to survive the first year</a> (76 percent) than those relocated north of I-90 (40 percent), according to the final project report, released in June. Remote-camera data suggest that’s because there are less prey and slightly more predators in the North Cascades, says Tanner Humphries, community wildlife monitoring program lead for Conservation Northwest.</p>



<p>And in both the Cascades and the Olympic Peninsula, fishers are using different types of habitat than biologists had predicted, Happe says. The mammals — once assumed to be old-growth specialists — are using a mosaic of young and old forests. Fishers require large, old trees with cavities for denning and resting. But in younger managed forests where trees are thinned or cut, prey may be easier to come by.</p>



<p>Live traps in the South Cascades support that idea. Fishers’ preferred prey — snowshoe hares and mountain beavers — were most abundant in young regenerating forests. In older forests, traps <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037811271931833X?via%3Dihub" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037811271931833X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected mainly mice, voles and chipmunks</a>, which are not substantial meals for fishers, Mitchell Parsons, a wildlife ecologist at Utah State University in Logan, reported with Lewis, Werntz and others in 2020 in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>.</p>

<h4>The future is re-wild</h4>



<p>After F023’s baby was caught on camera five years ago, the mother’s tracking chip degraded as designed — the hardware lasts less than two years. Since then, many more fisher kits have been born in Washington.</p>



<p>In fact, these furry carnivores are one of the most successfully translocated mammals in North America. According to Lewis, 41 different translocation efforts across the continent have helped fisher populations blossom. The animals now occupy 68 percent of their historical range, up from 43 percent in the mid-1900s.</p>



<p>With the last batch of fishers delivered to Washington in 2021, the relocation phase of the project has ended. Lewis, Happe and their partners plan to continue monitoring how these sleek tree-climbing carnivores are faring — and how the ecosystem is responding. For instance, fishers are indeed <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/534cb901e4b0bf0aaecab50f/t/62d05a194070f66efe548b22/1657821721947/Happe+et+al+2021+NWNat+OP+Fisher+diet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feasting on seedling-eating mountain beavers</a>, according to research reported by Happe, Lewis and others in 2021 in <em>Northwestern Naturalist</em>.</p>



<p>Given climate change, species loss and ecosystem degradation, animals worldwide face difficult challenges. The fact that fishers are thriving once again in Washington offers hope, Lewis says.</p>



<p>“It’s a hard time, it’s a hard world, and this feels like something we’re doing right,” he says. “Instead of losing something, we’re getting it back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-buried-lake-ice-rock-liquid-water-radar">Mars’ buried ‘lake’ might just be layers of ice and rock</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Follow the water” has long been the mantra of scientists searching for life beyond Earth. After all, the only known cradle of life in the cosmos is the watery planet we call home. But now there’s more evidence suggesting that a potential discovery of liquid water on Mars <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01775-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not be so watertight</a>, researchers report September 26 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>In 2018, scientists announced <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid-water-search-life">the discovery of a large subsurface lake near Mars’ south pole</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/18</em>). That claim — and follow-up observations suggesting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-south-pole-ice-surrounded-pools-water">additional buried pools of liquid water</a> on the Red Planet (<em>SN: 9/28/20</em>) — fueled excitement about finally finding an extraterrestrial world possibly conducive to life.</p>





<p>But researchers have since proposed that those discoveries might not hold up to scrutiny. In 2021, one group suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lakes-liquid-water-south-pole-ice-cap-mirages">clay minerals and frozen brines</a>, rather than liquid water, might be responsible for the strong radar signals that researchers observed (<em>SN: 7/16/21</em>). Spacecraft orbiting Mars beam radio waves toward the Red Planet and measure the timing and intensity of the reflected waves to infer what’s beneath the Martian surface. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now another team has shown that ordinary layers of rock and ice can produce many of the same radar signals previously attributed to water. Planetary scientist Dan Lalich of Cornell University and his colleagues calculated how flat layers of bedrock, water ice and carbon dioxide ice — all known to be plentiful on Mars — reflect radio waves. “It was a pretty simple analysis,” Lalich says.</p>



<p>The researchers found that they could reproduce some of the anomalously strong radar signals thought to be due to liquid water. Individual radar signals from different layers of rock and ice add together when the layers are a certain thickness, Lalich says. That produces a stronger signal, which is then picked up by a spacecraft’s instruments. But those instruments can’t always tell the difference between a radio wave coming from one layer and one that’s the result of multiple layers, he says. “They look like one reflection to the radar.”</p>



<p>These results don’t rule out liquid water on Mars, Lalich and his colleagues acknowledge. “This is just saying that there are other options,” he says.</p>



<p>The new finding is “a plausible scenario,” says Aditya Khuller, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved in the research. But until scientists get a lot more data from the Red Planet, it’ll be difficult to know whether liquid water truly exists on Mars, Khuller says. “It’s important to be open-minded at this point.”</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity, Ecosytem Services and Sustainable Development</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> is welcoming submissions to its ‘</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/about/bessd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Sustainable Development</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216; Collection, which aims to bring together research on the sustainable use of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, I was keen to learn about new areas related to this topic. </span></p>

<p><strong><em>The impact of hydropower on aquatic ecosystems</em></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I very much enjoyed a talk given by <a href="https://n.ethz.ch/~lumartins/">Dr Luiz Silva</a>, a senior scientist developing an Ecohyraulics research group within the Institute for Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich. Ecohydrology involves collaboration between ecologists, hydrologists and engineers to explore practical solutions to increase the capacity of the aquatic ecosystems to cope with human impacts. With the humans causing unprecedented change to the natural world, it is more important than ever to manage water resources sustainably to prevent further biodiversity loss.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr Silva introduced modelling techniques to research fish interaction with water infrastructure. He proposed a tool to quantify habitat shifts and pathways for fish to escape rapid flow changes such as those caused by hydropeaking. Hydropeaking describes the discontinuous release of water that introduce artificial flow fluctuations in rivers to increase hydroelectric power production at hydro dams to meet electricity demand. With hydropower becoming more widely used as we transition to renewable energy sources, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact of hydropower on aquatic ecosystems and to consider how to design hydropower technology with fish in mind. <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> encourages submissions on this topic and is delighted to welcome Dr Luiz Silva as an Editorial Board Member. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Upscaling agroecology practices</em></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A series of insightful talks on integrating ecological principles into the design and management of agricultural systems also piqued my interest. <a href="https://forschung.boku.ac.at/fis/suchen.person_uebersicht?sprache_in=en&amp;menue_id_in=101&amp;id_in=151817">Dr Andreas Mayer</a>, a new <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> Editorial Board Member from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, discussed the need for transformative changes to increase the sustainability of agri-food systems and achieve the European Green Deal’s goal to become climate neutral by 2050. To understand what changes are feasible, we require a deeper understanding of which practices and changes are sustainable if widely adopted without risking supply shortfalls or burden shifting. We also need greater knowledge of synergies and trade-offs in the agricultural system. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr Mayer introduced the diagnostic biophysical land-system and G</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reen House Gas (GHG) emission</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> model <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021002817?via%3Dihub">BioBaM-GHG 2.0</a>. The model aims to evaluate the feasibility and associated GHG emissions of large numbers of agro-food systems and land-use scenarios at various geographical scales. As an illustrative example, Dr Mayer described the use of the tool to analyse strategies for the expansion of agroecological measures in the European Union.</span></p>
<p><strong>Plants under pressure: The impact of environmental change on plant ecology </strong></p>
<p>The congress provided an invaluable opportunity to attend a number of talks on the impact of environmental change on plant ecology. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the human impact on the planet intensifies, plants are becoming increasingly under pressure. According to the IUCN redlist, one in five plant species are under threat of extinction. Life on earth depends on plants which provide food, fuel, shelter, medicine, clean air, absorb carbon dioxide, </span>filter water, and supply the oxygen we breathe. Losing a plant species affects every organism that directly or indirectly relies on it. Therefore, research on the impact of human activity and climate change on plants is needed to help develop strategies to safeguard ecosystem services and reverse biodiversity decline. <span data-preserver-spaces="true"><em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> encourages submissions on this topic and is looking to recruit Editorial Board Members with expertise researching the impact of environmental change on plant ecology. If you have expertise in this field and would like to join the Editorial Board, please reach out to Jennifer Harman &lt;<a href="mailto:jennifer.harman@springernature.com">jennifer.harman@springernature.com</a>&gt;.</span></p>
<p>Dr Isabel Barrio, an ecologist at <span data-preserver-spaces="true">the Agricultural University of Iceland, gave an eye opening talk on plant-herbivore interactions in the changing north. Plant-herbivore interactions play a vital role in the functioning of alpine and Arctic tundra ecosystems through their effects on biodiversity, energy flows and nutrient cycling. However, these ecosystems are rapidly changing due to global warming. As climate change threatens to destabilise these ecosystems, collaborative research on plant-herbivore interactions is needed to develop management strategies, set conservation priorities, preserve ecosystem services and protect biodiversity. Dr Barrio leads the <a href="https://old.uarctic.org/shared-voices/shared-voices-magazine-2021/eating-plants-to-mitigate-the-impacts-of-climate-change-on-tundra/">UArctic Thematic Network on Herbivory</a> &#8211; an international network consisting of over 200 members that brings together researchers investigating the role of herbivores in alpine and arctic ecosystems. The researchers suggest that plant damage by insects will likely increase in a warmer Arctic as you can find insects throughout the tundra, and insect herbivory rises with temperature. For a full list of Herbivory Network publications, <a href="https://herbivory.lbhi.is/hn-papers-and-conference-presentations/">click here</a>. In 2023, <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> looks forward to working with Dr Barrio to launch a call for papers relating to this research area. </span></p>

<p>A personal highlight was a talk given by <a href="http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/chinsamyturan">Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turnan</a> from The University of Cape Town. Anusuya elegantly introduced how information locked within the bones of extinct species can provide glimpses into long-lost worlds.</p>
<p>For example, the presence of medullary bone in fossil birds, a tissue unique to reproductively active female birds, can be used to identify female specimens. This knowledge was used to show that deposits of Dromornis stirtoni specimens ((a.k.a the Thunder Bird)<em> </em>containing two forms was due to sexual dimorphism. Bone histology has also revealed new information about the life history of the dodo, which shows that this iconic bird adapted its lifestyle to Mauritius’s cyclone season (from November and March). Dodo bones exhibit repeated lines of arrested growth, indicating periods of food shortage during stormy weather. Similar to modern birds living on the island, the breeding season of dodos was likely to have been in August. Once chicks hatched, they grew quickly to sexual maturity before the cyclone season began. Cavities indicative of bone resorption, which accompanies new feather growth, suggest that dodos molted between March and July.</p>
<p>Given the attention that recent <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> paleoecology articles have received, it is clear that our readers are also captivated by research that furthers our understanding of extinct species.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silkworm-artificial-silk-strong-fiber-spider-metal-ion-bath">A metal ion bath may make fibers stronger than spider silk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Super strong artificial silk? That’s so metal.</p>



<p>Giving revamped silkworm silk a metallic bath <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00517-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may make the strands both strong and stiff</a>, scientists report October 6 in <em>Matter</em>. Some strands were up to 70 percent stronger than silk spun by spiders, the team found.</p>



<p>The work is the latest in a decades-long quest to create fibers as strong, lightweight and biodegradable as spider silk. If scientists could mass-produce such material, the potential uses range from the biomedical to the athletic. Sutures, artificial ligaments and tendons — even sporting equipment could get an arachnid enhancement.</p>







<p>“If you&#8217;ve got a climbing rope that weighs half of what it normally does and still has the same mechanical properties, then obviously you&#8217;re going to be a happy climber,” says Randy Lewis, a silk scientist at Utah State University in Logan who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Scrounging up enough silky material to make these super strong products has been a big hurdle. Silk from silkworms is simple to harvest, but not all that strong. And spider silk, the gold-standard for handspun strength and toughness, is not exactly easy to collect. “Unlike silkworms, spiders cannot be farmed due to their territorial and aggressive nature,” write study coauthor Zhi Lin, a structural biologist at Tianjin University in China, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Scientists around the world have tried to spin sturdy strands in the lab using silkworm cocoons as a starting point. The first step is to strip off the silk’s gummy outer coating. Scientists can do this by boiling the fibers in a chemical bath, but that can be like taking a hatchet to silk proteins. If the proteins get too damaged, it’s hard for scientists to respin them into high-quality strands, says Chris Holland, a materials scientist at the University of Sheffield in England who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Lin’s team tried gentler approaches, one of which used lower temperatures and a papaya enzyme, to help dissolve the silk’s coating. That mild-mannered method seemed to work. &nbsp;“They don’t have little itty-bitty pieces of silk protein,” Lewis says. “That’s huge because the bigger the proteins that remain, the stronger the fibers are going to be.”</p>

Wang <em>et al</em>/<em>Matter</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After some processing steps, the researchers forced the resulting silk sludge through a tiny tube, like squeezing out toothpaste. Then, they bathed the extruded silk in a solution containing zinc and iron ions, eventually stretching the strands like taffy to make long, skinny fibers. The metal dip could be why some of the strands were so strong — Lin’s team detected zinc ions in the finished fibers. But Holland and Lewis aren’t so sure.</p>



<p>The team’s real innovation may be that “they’ve managed to unspin silk in a less damaging way,” Holland says. Lewis agrees. “In my mind,” he says, “that&#8217;s a major step forward.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-spores-cells-life-signals-environment">How dormant bacteria spores sense when it’s time to come back to life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bacteria go to extremes to handle hard times: They hunker down, building a fortress-like shell around their DNA and turning off all signs of life. And yet, when times improve, these dormant spores can rise from the seeming dead.</p>



<p>But “you gotta be careful when you decide to come back to life,” says Peter Setlow, a biochemist at UConn Health in Farmington. “Because if you get it wrong, you die.” How is a spore to tell?</p>





<p>For spores of the bacterium <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, the solution is simple: It counts.</p>



<p>These “living rocks” sense it’s time to revive, or germinate, by essentially <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counting how often they encounter nutrients</a>, researchers report in a new study in the Oct. 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“They appear to have literally no measurable biological activity,” says Gürol Süel, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego. But Süel and his colleagues knew that spores’ cores contain positively charged potassium atoms, and because these atoms can move around without the cell using energy, the team suspected that potassium could be involved in shocking the cells awake.</p>



<p>So the team exposed <em>B. subtilis</em> spores to nutrients and used colorful dyes to track the movement of potassium out of the core. With each exposure, more potassium left the core, shifting its electrical charge to be more negative. Once the spores’ cores were negatively charged enough, germination was triggered, like a champagne bottle finally popping its cork. The number of exposures it took to trigger germination varied by spore, just like some corks require more or less twisting to pop. Spores whose potassium movement was hamstrung showed limited change in electric charge and were less likely to “pop” back to life no matter how many nutrients they were exposed to, the team’s experiments showed.</p>



<p>Changes in the electrical charge of a cell are important across the tree of life, from determining when brain cells zip off messages to each other, to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-venus-flytraps-store-short-term-memories-prey">snapping of a Venus flytrap</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Finding that spores also use electrical charges to set their wake-up calls excites Süel. “You want to find principles in biology,” he says, “processes that cross systems, that cross fields and boundaries.”</p>



<p>Spores are not only interesting for their unique and extreme biology, but also for practical applications. Some “can cause some rather nasty things” from food poisoning to anthrax, says Setlow, who was not involved in the study. Since spores are resistant to most antibiotics, understanding germination could lead to a way to bring them back to life in order to kill them for good.</p>



<p>Still, there are many unanswered questions about the “black box” of how spores start germination, like whether it’s possible for the spores to “reset” their potassium count. “We really are in the beginnings of trying to fill in that black box,” says Kaito Kikuchi, a biologist now at Reveal Biosciences in San Diego who conducted the work while at University of California, San Diego. But discovering how spores manage to track their environment while more dead than alive is an exciting start.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jazz-music-swing-rhythm-timing">Here’s where jazz gets its swing</a></h4>

              
                <p>It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing — all you’ve got to do is stagger your timing.</p>



<p>For decades, fans of jazz music have debated why some songs have swing — the characteristic swaying feeling that compels feet to tap and heads to bop. Now, scientists may finally have an answer to Louis Armstrong’s classic song “What Is This Thing Called Swing?” and the secret lies in the timing of jazz soloists.</p>





<p>After listening to original and digitally tweaked piano recordings, jazz musicians were more than seven times as likely to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00995-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rate music as “swinging”</a> when the soloist’s timing was partially delayed with respect to the rhythm section, researchers report October 6 in <em>Communications Physics.</em></p>



<p>In jazz, musicians are trained to swing eighth notes, or extend the duration of their downbeats — every other eighth note — and shorten the beats in between to create a galloping rhythm. But the technique on its own doesn’t explain swing, says physicist Theo Geisel. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program">Computer-generated</a> jazz songs with swung eighth notes still lack the style’s swaying feel (<em>SN: 2/17/22</em>).</p>



<p>Past research hinted that swing might arise from differences in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jazz-improvisers-score-high-creativity">the timing between musicians</a> within a band (<em>SN: 1/2/18</em>). So Geisel and colleagues tweaked only the timing of the soloists in jazz recordings on a computer and asked professional and semiprofessional jazz musicians to rate each recording’s swing.</p>



<p>Musicians were nearly 7.5 times as likely to judge music as more swinging when the soloists’ downbeats were minutely delayed with respect to the rhythm section, but not their offbeats.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Got swing?</h3>



<p>In a new study, jazz musicians rated the “swing” of these recordings of the song “Jordu” by Clifford Brown. The first recording is an unaltered version, and the second recording has been manipulated to increase the delay of the soloist&#8217;s downbeats by a very small amount. The musicians rated the tweaked recording as having more swing than the original.</p>

<p>Most of the musicians couldn’t put their finger on what was causing the effect, says Geisel, of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen, Germany. “Professional jazz musicians who have played for many years apparently have learned to do this unconsciously.”</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed 456 jazz performances from various artists and found almost all soloists used downbeat delays, with an average delay of 30 milliseconds. This average held across the jazz subgenres of bebop, swing and hardbop, though there was some variation, Geisel says. “For faster tempos, the delays get smaller.”</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Geisel intends to investigate how “laid-back playing” — a popular style of delaying both downbeats and offbeats in jazz — influences swing.</p>
