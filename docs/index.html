<p><strong>Psychologists interested in dreams spend a lot of time analysing dream diaries — but what if they could have a computer do all that laborious work for them? </strong>That’s the promise of a new algorithm that uses text analysis to look for patterns in people’s dream reports, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/new-algorithm-can-find-hidden-patterns-your-dreams">writes Charlotte Hartley</a> at <em>Science</em>. The tool could help researchers understand how dreams differ in different populations, or how the content of dreams relates to wellbeing.<span id="more-40144"></span></p>

<p><strong>Many people who live with eating disorders have experienced an exacerbation of their symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic,</strong> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-era-isolation-is-making-dangerous-eating-disorders-worse/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29">reports Michelle Konstantinovsky</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. There could be many reasons for this, including reduced social support and face-to-face therapy, a lack of structure, and increased feelings of anxiety.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Another study has found that there has been a <em>reduction</em> in anxiety among year nine students in southwest England during lockdown. </strong>While stuck at home, kids may have been protected from aspects of school which negatively affect their wellbeing, such as pressures associated with schoolwork and the need to navigate social relationships, <a href="https://theconversation.com/school-closures-had-positive-effects-on-some-teenagers-mental-health-our-new-research-suggests-144884">writes researcher Emily Widnall</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

<p><strong>Finally, acronyms are becoming increasingly common in scientific papers, creating barriers for science communication, </strong><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/science-journals-acronyms-communication/">reports Hannah Seo</a> at <em>Popular Science</em>. Researchers analysed 25 million papers published in the past 70 years, finding that abstracts and titles contained more than 1 million unique acronyms, most of which were only used a handful of times. More recent papers also contained a greater proportion of acronyms. There is clearly a place for acronyms, Seo writes, but overuse can make science less accessible to the public and even to scientists from different fields.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/puberty-teens-brain-stress-responses-early-trauma">Puberty can repair the brain’s stress responses after hardship early in life</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap">A researcher slips stickers under some colored cups on a lazy Susan, then gives the tray a whirl. When the spinning stops, a preschooler must find the hidden stickers. Most children remember where the stickers are, but a few have to check every single cup.</p>



<p>The game tests working memory, which is among the set of mental skills known as executive function that can be impaired in children who faced trauma early in life.</p>



<p>Adversity wreaks havoc, and from there, “you have a system that responds differently,” says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychobiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who has spent two decades studying the impact of early-life adversity in adopted children. The focus of this work is extreme adversity, such as being orphaned, rather than everyday challenges, which might teach beneficial resilience.</p>



<p>A childhood characterized by hardship, negligence or abuse can also alter the neuroendocrine system that regulates how the body responds to stress. Problems in the stress response can set kids on a path toward behavior struggles along with increased risk for depression, diabetes and a host of other health problems.</p>





<p>But recent studies offer hints that such a difficult future may not be inevitable. As Gunnar and others have shown, impaired stress responses can return to normal during puberty, raising the possibility that imbalances created by early trauma can be erased. The research is prompting a new view of puberty as an opportunity — a chance for people who had a shaky start to reset their physiological responses to stress.</p>



<h4>A sense of safety</h4>



<p>When the brain perceives a threat — even a temporary one such as a stressful exam or a high-stakes competition — levels of the hormone adrenaline shoot up, setting off the “fight-or-flight” reaction. Breathing and heart rate soar. Palms get sweaty. Sight and other senses sharpen. Before long, the brain sends chemical messengers to stimulate adrenal glands near the kidneys to release cortisol.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img alt="a photo of a child doing a spin-the-pots task" class="wp-image-3090649" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_EL_teen-brain_inline-1-502x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090649">A spin-the-pots task, with colored cups and hidden stickers, tests working memory, which can be impaired in children who experience early hardship.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090649">N.H. Brito <em>et al</em>/<em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> 2014</span></figure></div>



<p>Cortisol sends sugars into the blood for quick energy. The hormone also slows digestion, immune responses, growth and other processes considered nonessential in a fight-or-flight situation.</p>



<p>When the threat passes, the fight-or-flight response ends, at least in a person whose stress response is working as it should. Adrenaline and cortisol levels fall, heart rate slows and other systems resume business as usual.</p>



<p>When Gunnar started her doctoral work in the 1970s, researchers had already mapped out the key actors in the stress response. The neuro-endocrine signals involved form the HPA axis, short for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal. When rodents and monkeys face early-life adversity, the HPA axis gets thrown off-kilter. As methods became available for measuring cortisol from samples of saliva — rather than having to collect blood or urine — Gunnar set out to study how the HPA axis influences the brain and behavior in humans.</p>



<p>From experiments with newborn babies in the mid-1980s, Gunnar showed that having a secure parent relationship is important for a healthy neuroendocrine system and helps babies deal with stressful situations, such as getting immunizations. “You can go to the doctor as a baby and get a big shot in one leg and the other leg, and you’re crying your head off … but [the HPA axis] doesn’t kick off,” Gunnar says. However, shots or no shots, if babies get separated from their parents for even a few minutes, “their HPA axis shoots up like a rocket.”</p>



<p>Gunnar wondered what happens if that sense of safety is disrupted longer-term. She tried studying maltreated and impoverished children, but separating the effects of early hardship from later difficulties is not easy. “The way you start out in life tends to continue,” Gunnar says. A report published last November by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points to the long-term consequences: Compared with their peers, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6844e1.htm?s_cid=mm6844e1_w">adults who experienced childhood trauma are more likely to smoke</a>, drink heavily, have dropped out of high school and develop heart disease and a host of other chronic conditions.</p>



<p>A trip in the mid-1990s set Gunnar on a new path to answer that tricky research question. She ventured with a research team to an orphanage in eastern Romania, where young children were raised in overcrowded, inhumane conditions. “You walk into these wards, and all of a sudden you’re mobbed by kids saying ‘Mama, mama, mama’ … reaching their arms up to get held,” says Gunnar, who had two school-age sons at the time. “It was awful. I just wanted to bring them all home.”</p>



<p>What she did bring back to Minnesota, along with that searing memory, was a set of small vials, each containing a saliva sample from a 2- or 3-year-old orphan. To her surprise, the children’s cortisol levels — the end product of the neuroendocrine cascade — were lower than the average toddler’s. That finding offered a window into the effects of long-term parental deprivation on stress responses.</p>



<h4>Adoptee struggles</h4>



<p>To single out the effects of early hardship, Gunnar needed children who had started life in deprivation but then moved into healthy, supportive environments after infancy. Such children would be the ideal human analog for <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/6716163">all of the animal studies on early adversity</a>, she thought. It dawned on her that this group exists: adopted orphans.</p>



<p>Gunnar shared her idea with members of the adoption unit at the Minnesota Department of Human Services. With the department’s support and funding, she surveyed Minnesota parents who had adopted children internationally in the 1990s, and invited families to join a university <a href="https://innovation.umn.edu/international-adoption-project/">registry</a> and participate in research.</p>



<p>Many parents in the study had noticed early on that their adopted children had behavioral problems. And when the youngsters came to the university lab for problem-solving and sorting tests, including the lazy Susan task and the famous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kids-waiting-longer-classic-marshmallow-self-control-test">marshmallow test</a> of delayed gratification (<em>SN: 8/4/18, p. 14</em>), the children struggled with attention and self-regulation.</p>



<p>Like the Romanian orphans, these kids had lower cortisol levels than nonadopted children who had no behavioral problems. In the face of sustained hardship, which has the potential to encourage dangerously high levels of cortisol, a weak stress response — that is, producing less cortisol — could be “nature’s way of preserving the brain and body,” Gunnar speculates.</p>

<h3>Teen-time shift</h3>



<p>Before puberty, adopted children, who grew up with early-life trauma (gray curve), had blunted stress responses relative to kids living with biological parents (blue curve). By the time puberty ended, the adopted children showed normal cortisol patterns before, during and after a stressful task. Saliva was collected 20 minutes and 5 minutes before the task, then 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after the task. The researchers converted the data to a logarithmic scale, which shows negative numbers. The actual cortisol levels are between 0 and 1 micrograms per deciliter.</p>

<p>Studying the adoptees over time, she found that preschoolers with low cortisol often entered kindergarten with attention problems. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788556/">blunted</a> stress response persisted into middle childhood, even after an average of seven to eight years in a household with healthy caregiving.</p>



<p>That was disheartening, says Russell Romeo, a psychobiologist at Barnard College in New York City. “We’d always thought that maybe if these individuals get out of the adverse situations, they could start recalibrating their stress reactivity.”</p>



<p>But research Romeo had done in the mid-2000s gave Gunnar reason to think she just needed to look further down the road of the children’s lives.</p>



<h4>High time for change</h4>



<p>Romeo was studying rats to see if stress affects adolescent and adult brains differently. In one set of experiments, he subjected adult rats and prepubescent rats to acute stress — 30 minutes trapped inside a wire mesh container — and recorded their levels of corticosterone (the rat version of cortisol) before, during and after the confinement. Both groups produced similar hormone spikes when stressed, but in the juvenile rats, levels took much longer to return to normal.</p>



<p>When Romeo observed how the animals reacted to extended periods of stress — 30 minutes of restraint each day for seven days — the pattern was different. After the animals were released from the restraints, stress hormones surged higher in young rats than in adults. But the rats that were near puberty returned to baseline more quickly than the older animals. Taken together, Romeo’s studies suggested that neuroendocrine stress responses get shaped during puberty to emerge differently in adulthood.</p>



<p>In earlier work, researchers at McGill University in Montreal showed that moving adolescent rats into “enriched” environments — larger cages with more toys and cagemates — could <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/18/7840.long">reset stress responses</a> that had been thrown out of whack by early-life trauma.</p>



<p>These findings heartened Gunnar. “Maybe I should be looking at puberty,” she thought. It could be a time to recalibrate.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Closer to normal</h3>



<p>During a stressful activity (giving a speech, for example), saliva cortisol levels rose temporarily and returned to normal in those children who lived with their biological parents. Children who were adopted after starting life in an orphanage (an early-life trauma), had blunted cortisol responses during stages 1 to 2 of puberty. But at the tail end of puberty, stages 4 and 5, adopted children’s stress responses normalized.</p>

<p>So her team invited 280 7- to 14-year-olds — 122 children adopted from institutions and 158 from socioeconomically comparable biological families — into the lab to complete two stressful tasks. One involved challenging mental math. For the second task, each child prepared a five-minute speech introducing themselves to a new class of students. The children were told that their speech, given in front of a video camera and a mirror, would be rated by judges. Some kids spoke with confidence, while others looked nervous. “We did have one who burst into tears,” Gunnar says. But “we don’t torture them. If we think they’re too nervous, we help them quit.”</p>



<p>Before and after the speech and math tasks, researchers collected saliva samples from each child to measure cortisol levels. Participants’ pubertal status was assessed on a 1-to-5 scale: Stage 1 meant no noticeable body changes and stage 5 meant sexual maturation was complete.</p>



<p>Among kids in early puberty (stages 1–2), adopted kids had blunted cortisol levels before and after the tasks compared with children who lived with their biological parents. This result confirmed Gunnar’s previous research on preschool-aged international adoptees. In the late puberty group (stages 4–5), cortisol patterns looked similar for adopted and nonadopted kids.</p>



<p>To confirm HPA recalibration had occurred within the same child, rather than just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458083/">comparing across age groups</a>, Gunnar and colleagues brought participants in for the same tests one and two years later, for a total of three annual sessions.</p>



<p>The results, reported in the Nov. 26 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, show the body can <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/48/23984.abstract">recalibrate its response to stressors during puberty</a>. In other words, something happens in puberty — but not earlier in childhood — that allows the brain to shift back to normal stress responses that had been skewed by early trauma.</p>



<p>Matthew Duggan, a therapist in Long Beach, Calif., who specializes in childhood and adolescence, is encouraged by the findings and thinks they could apply to a wide range of children who have trouble managing their emotions and connecting with others because caretakers abused or ignored them early in life. There may be “a window … where things might be able to change,” Duggan says. “And we have some data here to suggest that at a biological level, that is a possibility. For me, that’s really hopeful to see.”</p>



<p>Duggan says Gunnar’s study would have been even more useful if it had assessed participants’ behavior change — for example, by interviewing parents, teachers or the adolescents themselves.</p>



<p>How might puberty combine with better caregiving and support to reshape neuroendocrine stress responses? Romeo speculates that it stems from the fact that the hypothalamus and other brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, that control our reactions to stress are among the regions that rewire and strengthen connections during adolescence.</p>



<p>Whether those changes in the stress response will ultimately harm or help a young person is hard to predict, Gunnar says. Mental health and resilience emerge from an ever-changing combination of genes and life experiences — some of which set the body awry early on. But adolescence could potentially erase some of the damage, her research shows. Gunnar and others hope to reveal more of the underlying biology behind the reboot.</p>

<h3>Is there a sweet spot for early adversity?</h3>



<p>Hardships early in life can mean a difficult road ahead. But some small amount of stress may help kids build mental toughness to handle the stresses of everyday life, such as big exams or performances (<em>SN: 6/8/19, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>“We learn to handle stress by handling stress,” says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychobiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>

<h4>Early-life stress affects later resilience</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="a graph showing how monkeys responded to stress in various sitiatuons" class="wp-image-3090653" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_EL_teen-brain_inline-3-mobile.png" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3090653">T. Tibbitts</span></figure>



<p>Groups of lab monkeys exposed to mild or moderate stress (yellow and red dots) showed lower anxiety later than animals exposed to no stress (blue) or heavy stress (black and white).</p>

<p>If a stressful experience shows “the world is tough but we can deal with it, perhaps with the help of family and friends,” she says, “we are tougher the next time.” On the other hand, feeling crushed by an intense stressor, such as abuse or a parent’s death, can impart a sense of helplessness that leaves young people “fearful of it happening again,” Gunnar says.</p>



<p>In a 2010 study, researchers surveyed 2,398 U.S. adults to understand how pain and stress affect resilience. Participants answered questions about their mental health and overall well-being, and indicated whether they had experienced cumulative lifetime adversities, including a serious illness or divorce in the family. The upshot: People who faced some adversity reported less distress and more life satisfaction compared with those who either experienced heavy adversity or sailed through childhood with ease.</p>



<p>Experiments in monkeys <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52810-5">suggest that this is more than a correlation</a>. A team led by David Lyons, a behavioral neuroscientist at Stanford University, reported causal evidence last November in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Since it can be unethical to randomly assign humans to stressful conditions, the team tested the effects of varying “doses” of stress in squirrel monkeys that had not yet reached puberty.</p>



<p>The monkeys in the control group enjoyed a typical lab life — housed in a cage with mom and siblings, plus plenty of water, food and toys. A second group faced a mild stressor — one hour of separation from siblings once daily for 10 days. The stress dose went up a notch for the third group, which had daily separation from siblings and no access to mom during that hour. Two additional groups experienced daily separation from mother and siblings, plus an injection as an additional stressor.</p>



<p>Ten weeks later, each monkey was moved with its mother to an unfamiliar cage. The researchers assessed the monkeys’ willingness to let go of mom and explore the new digs. The team also analyzed blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol before and after the time spent in the new cage. On the whole, monkeys in the groups that faced one or two stressors clung less to their mothers and more readily explored their new surroundings — showing less anxiety — than both the no-stress and the two high-stress groups.</p>



<p>Cortisol patterns also reflected this trend: Cortisol levels were closer to normal in monkeys exposed to mild or moderate stress than in monkeys from the other groups.</p>



<p>Growing up healthy means “learning how to deal with mild challenge and change,” Lyons says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire">What’s behind August 2020’s extreme weather? Climate change and bad luck</a></h4>

<p>August 2020 has been a devastating month across large swaths of the United States: As powerful Hurricane Laura barreled into the U.S. Gulf Coast on August 27, fires continued to blaze in California. Meanwhile, farmers are still assessing widespread damage to crops in the Midwest following an Aug. 10 “derecho,” a sudden, hurricane-force windstorm.</p>



<p>Each of these extreme weather events was the result of a particular set of atmospheric — and in the case of Laura, oceanic — conditions. In part, it’s just bad luck that the United States is being slammed with these events back-to-back-to-back. But for some of these events, such as intense hurricanes and more frequent wildfires, scientists have long warned that climate change has been setting the stage for disaster.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> takes a closer look at what causes these kinds of extreme weather events, and the extent to which human-caused climate change may be playing a role in each of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Satellite animation of Hurricane Laura" class="wp-image-3090858" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_feat_alt.gif" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090858">On August 25, NASA’s GOES-West satellite watched as hazy gray smoke emanating from hundreds of wildfires in California drifted eastward, while Hurricane Laura barreled toward Louisiana and Texas.

<h4>California wildfires</h4>



<p>A “dry lightning” storm, which produced nearly 11,000 bursts of lightning between August 15 and August 19, set off devastating wildfires in across California. To date, these fires have burned more than 520,000 hectares.</p>



<p>That is “an unbelievable number to say out loud, even in the last few years,” says climate scientist Daniel Swain, of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lightning in Santa Cruz, California" class="wp-image-3090874" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline7_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090874">Lightning crackles over Mitchell’s Cove in Santa Cruz, Calif., on August 16, part of a rare and severe storm system that triggered wildfires across the state.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090874">Shmuel Thaler/The Santa Cruz Sentinel via AP</span></figure>



<p>The storm itself was the result of a particular, unusual set of circumstances. But the region was already primed for fires, the stage set by a prolonged and record-breaking heat wave in the western United States — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-valley-hottest-recorded-temperature-earth">one of the hottest temperatures ever measured on Earth, at Death Valley</a>, Calif. — as well as extreme dryness in the region (<em>SN: 8/17/20</em>). And those conditions bear the fingerprints of climate change, Swain says.</p>



<p>The extreme dryness is particularly key, he adds. “It’s not just incremental; it absolutely matters <em>how</em> dry it is. You don’t just flip a switch from dry enough to burn to not dry enough to burn. There’s a wide gradient up to dry enough to burn explosively.”</p>



<p>Both California’s average heat and dryness have become more severe due to climate change, dramatically increasing the likelihood of extreme wildfires. In an Aug. 20 study in <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Swain and colleagues noted that over the last 40 years, average autumn temperatures increased across the state by about 1 degree Celsius, and statewide precipitation dropped by about 30 percent. That, in turn, has <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab83a7/pdf">more than doubled the number of autumn days</a> with extreme fire weather conditions since the early 1980s, they found.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LNU Lightning Complex wildfire" class="wp-image-3090873" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline6_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090873">An unusual dry lightning storm combined with very dry vegetation and a record-breaking heat wave to spark hundreds of wildfires across California between August 15 and August 19.

Firefighters continued to battle the LNU complex fires on August 23, including in unincorporated Lake County, Calif. (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090873">AP Photo/Noah Berger</span></figure>



<p>Although fall fires in California tend to be more wind-driven, and summertime fires more heat-driven, studies show that the fingerprint of climate change is present in both, Swain says. “A lot of it is very consistent with the long-term picture that scientists were suggesting would evolve.”</p>



<p>Though the stage had been set by the climate, the particular trigger for the latest fires was a “dry lightning” storm that resulted from a strange confluence of two key conditions, each in itself rare for the region and time of year. “’Freak storm’ would not be too far off,” Swain says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="California wildfire smoke" class="wp-image-3090875" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline8_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090875">Smoke still engulfed California on August 24, as more than 650 wildfires continued to blaze across the state (red dots indicate likely fire areas).

They are now second and third on the list of California’s largest wildfires.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090875">NASA Worldview, Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)</span></figure></div>



<p>The first was a plume of moisture from Tropical Storm Fausto, far to the south, which managed to travel north to California on the wind and provide just enough moisture to form clouds. The second was a small atmospheric ripple, the remnants of an old thunderstorm complex in the Sonoran Desert. That ripple, Swain says, was just enough to kick-start mixing in the atmosphere; such vertical motion is the key to thunderstorms. The resulting clouds were stormy but very high, their bases at least 3,000 meters aboveground. They produced plenty of lightning, but most rain would have evaporated during the long dry journey down.</p>



<p>Possible links between climate change and the conditions that led to such a dry lightning storm would be “very hard to disentangle,” Swain says. “The conditions are rare to begin with, and not well modeled from a weather perspective.”</p>





<p>But, he adds, “we know there’s a climate signal in the background conditions that allowed that rare event to have the outcome it did.”</p>



<h4>Midwest derecho</h4>



<p>On August 10, a powerful windstorm with the ferocity of a hurricane traveled over 1,200 kilometers in just 14 hours, leaving a path of destruction from eastern South Dakota to western Ohio.</p>



<p>The storm was what’s known as a derecho, roughly translating to “straight ahead.” These storms have winds rivaling the strength of a hurricane or tornado, but push forward in one direction instead of rotating. By definition, a derecho produces sustained winds of at least 93 kilometers per hour (similar to the fury of tropical storm-force winds), nearly continuously, for at least 400 kilometers. Their power is equally devastating: The August derecho flattened millions of hectares of crops, uprooted trees, damaged homes, flipped trucks and left hundreds of thousands of people without power.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Iowa derecho storm damage" class="wp-image-3090870" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline4_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090870">A powerful derecho on August 10 twisted these corn and soybean grain bins in Luther, Iowa.

<p>The Midwest has had many derechos before, says Alan Czarnetzki, a meteorologist at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. What made this one significant and unusual was its intensity and scale — and, Czarnetzki notes, the fact that it took even researchers by surprise.</p>



<p>Derechos originate within a mesoscale convective system — a vast, organized system of thunderclouds that are the basic building block for many different kinds of storms, including hurricanes and tornadoes. Unlike the better-known rotating supercells, however, derechos form from long bands of swiftly moving thunderstorms, sometimes called squall lines. In hindsight, derechos are easy to recognize. In addition to the length and strength conditions, derechos acquire a distinctive bowlike shape on radar images; this one appeared as though the storm was aiming its arrow eastward.</p>



<p>But the storms are much more difficult to forecast, because the conditions that can lead them to form can be very subtle. And there’s overall less research on these storms than on their more dramatic cousins, tornadoes. “We have to rely on situational awareness,” Czarnetzki says. “Like people, sometimes you can have an exceptional storm arise from very humble origins.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Derecho radar </h3>



<p>The August 10 derecho, seen in radar images here as it moved across the Midwest (times are CDT) had a distinctive curved shape on radar, like a bow poised to shoot an arrow eastward. In some places, the storm had sustained winds of about 160 kilometers per hour, comparable to the wind strength of a Category 3 hurricane.</p>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Iowa derecho radar" class="wp-image-3090871" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline5_desktop_680.png" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3090871">National Weather Service</span></figure></div>



<div class="image-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Iowa derecho radar" class="wp-image-3090872" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline5_mobile_680.png" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3090872">National Weather Service</span></figure></div>
</div>



<p>The Aug. 10 derecho was particularly long and strong, with sustained winds in some places of up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles an hour). Still, such a strong derecho is not unheard of, Czarnetzki says. “It’s probably every 10 years you’d see something this strong.”</p>



<p>Whether such strong derechos might become more, or less, common due to climate change is difficult to say, however. Some anticipated effects of climate change, such as warming at the planet’s surface, could increase the likelihood of more and stronger derechos by increasing atmospheric instability. But warming higher in the atmosphere, also a possible result of climate change, could similarly increase atmospheric stability, Czarnetzki says. “It’s a straightforward question with an uncertain answer.”</p>



<h4>Atlantic hurricanes</h4>



<p>Hurricane Laura roared ashore in Louisiana in the early morning hours of August 27 as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of about 240 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour). Just two days earlier, the storm had been a Category 1. But in the mere 24 hours from August 25 to August 26, the storm rapidly intensified, supercharged by warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Hurricane Lauran satellite image" class="wp-image-3090869" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline3_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090869">Hurricane Laura intensified rapidly due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening from a Category 1 hurricane on August 25 to a Category 4 on August 26 (shown). The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas to expect a storm surge — ocean waters elevated by the storm above the normal tide level — of as much as five meters.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090869">NOAA</span></figure></div>



<p>The Atlantic hurricane season is already setting several new records, with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration predicting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predictions-2020-atlantic-hurricane-storm-season-worse">as many as 25 named storms</a>, the most the agency has ever anticipated (<em>SN: 8/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>At present, 2005 still holds the record for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chances-atlantic-hurricane-season-busier-2005-are-slim">most named storms</a> to actually form in the Atlantic in a given season, at 28 (<em>SN: 8/22/18</em>). But 2020 may yet surpass that record. By August 26, 13 named storms had already formed in the Atlantic, the most ever before September.</p>



<p>The previous week, researchers pondered whether another highly unusual set of circumstances might be in the offing. As Laura’s track shifted southward, away from Florida, tropical storm Marco appeared to be on track to enter the Gulf of Mexico right behind it. That might have induced a type of physical interaction known as a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/fujiwhara-effect">Fujiwhara effect</a>, in which a strong storm might strengthen further as it absorbs the energy of a lesser storm. In perhaps a stroke of good luck in the midst of this string of weather extremes, Marco dissipated instead.</p>



<p>As Hurricane Laura approached landfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?start">“unsurvivable” storm surges</a> of up to five meters could inundate the Gulf Coast in parts of Texas and Louisiana. Storm surge is the height to which the seawater level rises as a result of a storm, on top of the normal tidal level.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="hurricane debris in Lake Charles, Louisiana" class="wp-image-3090868" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090868">Debris litters Lake Charles, La., in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura’s landfall August 27.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090868">AP Photo/Gerald Herbert</span></figure>



<p>It’s impossible to attribute the fury of any one storm to climate change, but scientists have observed a statistically significant link between <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975">warmer waters and hurricane intensity</a>. Warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean, the result of climate change, juiced up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season">2017’s hurricanes</a>, including Irma and Maria, researchers have found (<em>SN: 9/28/18</em>).</p>



<p>And the Gulf of Mexico’s bathlike waters have notably supercharged several hurricanes in recent years. In 2018, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/whats-unusual-about-hurricane-michael">Hurricane Michael</a> intensified rapidly before slamming into the Florida panhandle (<em>SN: 10/10/18</em>). And in 2005, hurricanes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-and-fury">Katrina</a> and Rita did the same before making landfall (<em>SN: 9/13/05</em>).</p>



<p>As for Laura, one contributing factor to its rapid intensification was a drop in wind shear as it spun through the Gulf.  Wind shear, a change in the speed and/or direction of winds with height, can disrupt a storm’s structure, robbing it of some of its power.  But the Gulf’s warmer-than-average waters, which in some locations approached 32.2° C (90° Fahrenheit), were also key to the storm’s sudden strength. And, by warming the oceans, climate change is also setting the stage for supercharged storms, scientists say. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-planet-building-blocks-more-water-once-thought">Earth’s building blocks may have had far more water than previously thought</a></h4>

<p>Earth’s deep stores of water may have been locally sourced rather than trucked in from far-flung regions of the solar system.</p>



<p>A new analysis of meteorites from the inner solar system — home to the four rocky planets — suggests that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba1948">Earth’s building blocks delivered enough water to account for all the H<sub>2</sub>O buried within the planet</a>. What’s more, the water produced by the local primordial building material likely shares a close chemical kinship with Earth’s deep-water reserves, thus strengthening the connection, researchers report in the Aug. 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Earth is thought to have been born in an interplanetary desert, too close to the sun for water ice to survive. Many researchers suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-did-earth-get-its-water">ocean water got delivered toward the end of Earth’s formation by ice-laden asteroids</a> that wandered in from cooler, more distant regions of the solar system (<em>SN: 5/6/15</em>). But the ocean isn’t the planet’s largest water reservoir. Researchers estimate that Earth’s interior holds several times as much water as is found at the surface.</p>



<p>To test whether or not the material that formed Earth could have delivered this deep water, cosmochemist Laurette Piani of the University of Lorraine in Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France, and colleagues analyzed meteorites known as enstatite chondrites. Thanks to many chemical similarities with Earth rocks, these relatively rare meteorites are widely thought to be good analogs of the dust and space rocks from the inner solar system that formed Earth’s building blocks, Piani says.</p>





<p>She and her team measured the abundance of hydrogen in these meteorites — a proxy for how much H<sub>2</sub>O they could produce — and calculated that local interplanetary debris had the potential to deliver at least three times as much water as is found in all the oceans. The meteorites don’t contain water, Piani says. Rather, they house enough of the raw ingredients to create water when heated.</p>



<p>In the meteorites, the team also found a close match to the type of water found in Earth’s mantle. A smattering of all water molecules on Earth contain a heavy variant of hydrogen known as deuterium. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the enstatite chondrites lies within the range measured in Earth’s deep water. That similarity, the team argues, makes a strong case for local building blocks being the source of much of the planet’s water.</p>



<p>“This work is something I wanted to do myself or had been waiting for someone to do,” says Lydia Hallis, a planetary scientist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. In 2015, she led a team that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-water-originated-close-home-lava-analysis-suggests">measured the deuterium abundance in lava plumes that tap deep into Earth’s mantle</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/15</em>). “I’m really happy that [the new data] sits within the region where our previous data from deep mantle samples is sitting.”</p>



<p>Hallis and others stress that these new measurements are difficult. Once the meteorites hit the ground, they quickly absorb hydrogen from Earth’s environment. “They did a really good job of picking the right meteorites and making the right measurements,” she says. “This is pretty convincing that this hydrogen that’s measured is from the enstatite chondrites rather than from terrestrial contamination.”</p>



<p>The enstatite chondrites could have also contributed a lot of water to the oceans as well — but they are not the full story. The deuterium-hydrogen ratio in ocean water, which is a bit higher than that of mantle water, is better matched to the ratio found in icy asteroids from the outer solar system. “We still need a bit of water coming from the outer solar system,” Piani says. So, while local materials may have delivered the bulk of Earth’s water, the oceans were likely topped off a bit later by collisions with remote space rocks.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>One of the classic findings in memory research is that we’re better at remembering information when we’re in a similar context to that in which we learned it. This was perhaps most famously demonstrated in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x?saml_referrer">a 1975 study</a>, which found that people who learned a list of words while scuba diving had better memory for the words when again underwater, compared to when on land (similarly, those who had learned the list on land were better at remembering it on land).</p>



<p>But it’s not just the external environment that matters: our internal states can also provide memory cues. For instance, people who were intoxicated when learning information were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5774177/">better at recalling that information when drunk</a> than when sober, and there’s also evidence that our recall is better <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-32292-001">when our mood matches how we felt at learning</a>.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13444">new study published in <em>Child Development</em></a> has found that the same is true even of babies in their first year of life. The findings have implications for understanding infant memory — and could even help to explain why we can’t remember anything from our early years.</p>


<p><span id="more-40135"></span></p>


<p>To look at state-dependent memory in babies, Sabine Seehagen and colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany recruited 96 nine-month-old infants and their caregivers. In the learning phase of the experiment, the babies watched a researcher perform a series of actions with an animal puppet: removing the puppet’s mitten, shaking it three times, then replacing it. </p>



<p>After a short break, there was a test phase where the infant had the opportunity to play with the puppet themselves. They had 90 seconds to do any of the three actions — i.e. remove the mitten, shake it, and replace it — though they weren’t prompted to do so in any way.</p>



<p>Crucially, immediately before the learning and testing phases, the babies had a 5 minute play session designed to put them in a specific state of mind. Sometimes caregivers were instructed to play as calmly as possible with their infant and they were given quiet toys like a book and soft toy. Other times they were instructed to play as animatedly as possible, and given more active toys like a ball and swing.</p>



<p>For one group of infants, the play sessions were the same before both learning and testing phases (i.e. calm both times, or animated both times). In another group, the play sessions were different (i.e. calm at learning and animated at testing, or vice-versa). And a third group only did the testing phase, without the learning part (this allowed the researchers to look at how often the babies performed the actions just by chance).  </p>



<p>The team found that infants who had the same kind of play before both learning and testing made an average of 1.47 actions during testing. This was significantly more than those whose play sessions were different, who only made an average of 0.59 actions. In fact, the babies in the latter condition didn’t seem to remember the actions at all: they performed no better than the babies who hadn’t even done the learning part of the study.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that internal states do provide important cues for babies when they’re retrieving memories. And that seems to make sense: while older children and adults have a wealth of knowledge and experiences which allow them to use a variety of cues to trigger memories, young infants haven’t yet formed those connections. Relying on internal states to aid recall is therefore “highly adaptive”, the authors say.</p>



<p>This reliance on internal cues might also contribute to “infantile amnesia”, the fact that we’re unable to recall anything from our earliest years. As we grow our internal state changes considerably, and is never again going to match that of our first years of life — so, like the babies in the “different state” condition, we’re not able to access our memories.  </p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that the research didn’t directly measure babies’ internal states, as the team acknowledges. During the animated play sessions, the babies did show significantly more movement and active behaviour than during the calm sessions. But further work will be required to see whether memory recall is truly dependent on infants’ emotions — it could be that the matching types of activity were somehow providing cues to the babies even without influencing their mood.</p>

<p>Weather forecasters in the Philippines got the tip-off in the second week of November 2019. A precipitation forecast that peered further into the future than usual warned that the islands faced torrential rains more than three weeks away. The meteorologists alerted local and national governments, which sprang into action. Mobile phone and broadcast alerts advised people to prepare to evacuate.</p>



<p>By the time the Category 4 Typhoon Kammuri lashed the Philippines with heavy rains in early December, the damage was much less than it could have been. Having so much time to prepare was key, says Andrew Robertson, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society in Palisades, N.Y. “It’s a great example of how far we’ve come” in weather forecasting, he says. “But we still need to go further.”</p>



<p>Such efforts, known as “subseasonal forecasting,” aim to fill a crucial gap in weather prediction. The approach fits between short-term forecasts that are good out to about 10 days in the future and seasonal forecasts that look months ahead.</p>



<p>A subseasonal forecast predicts average weather conditions three to four weeks away. Each day of additional warning gives emergency managers that much more time to prepare for incoming heat waves, cold snaps, tornadoes or other wild weather. Groups such as the Red Cross are starting to use subseasonal forecasts to strategize for weather disasters, such as figuring out where to move emergency supplies when it looks like a tropical cyclone might hit a region. Farmers look to subseasonal forecasts to better plan when to plant and irrigate crops. And operators of dams and hydropower plants could use the information to get ready for extra water that may soon tax the systems.</p>





<p>Subseasonal forecasting is improving slowly but steadily, thanks to better computer models and new insights about the atmospheric and oceanic patterns that drive weather over the long term. “This is a new frontier,” says Frédéric Vitart, a meteorologist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England.</p>

<h3>On target </h3>



<p>A forecast made in the second week of November (top) foresaw heavy rains coming more than three weeks later over the Philippines, which did indeed arrive as Typhoon Kammuri (actual path shown, bottom).</p>

<h4>The in-between</h4>



<p>Weather forecasters are always pushing to do better. They feed weather observations from around the world into the latest computer models, then wait to see what the models spit out as the most likely weather in the coming days. Then the researchers tweak the model and feed it more data, repeating the process again and again until the forecasts improve.</p>



<p>But anyone who tells you it will be 73° Fahrenheit and sunny at 3 p.m. four weeks from Monday is lying. That’s just too far out in time to be accurate. Short-term forecasts like those in your smartphone’s weather app are based on the observations that feed into them, such as whether it is currently rainy in Northern California or whether there are strong winds over central Alaska. For forecasting further into the future, what the rain or winds were like many days ago becomes less and less relevant. Most operational weather forecasts are good to about 10 to 14 days but no further.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Evacuated residents in the Philippines" class="wp-image-3090698" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline3_1030.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090698">Early warnings of Typhoon Kammuri’s approach enabled safe evacuations of many thousands of residents of the Philippines in early December 2019.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090698">Ezra Acayan/Stringer/Getty Images News</span></figure>



<p>A few times a year, forecasters draw up seasonal predictions, which rely on very different types of information than the current weather conditions that feed short-term forecasts. The long-term seasonal outlooks predict whether it will be hotter or colder, or wetter or drier, than normal over the next three months. Those broad-brush perspectives on how regional climate is expected to vary are based on slowly evolving planetary patterns that drive weather over the scale of months. Such patterns include the intermittent oceanic warming known as El Niño, the extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and the amounts of moisture in soils across the continents.</p>



<p>Between short-term and seasonal prediction lies the realm of subseasonal prediction. Making such forecasts is hard because the initial information that drives short-term forecasts is no longer useful, but the longer-term trends that drive seasonal forecasts have not yet become apparent. “That’s one of the reasons there’s so much work on this right now,” says Emily Becker, a climate scientist at the University of Miami in Florida. “We just ignored it for decades because it was so difficult.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Room to improve</h3>



<p>Short-term weather predictions and longer-term seasonal forecasts are relatively good. People need something in between, so researchers are trying to improve subseasonal forecasts, which look ahead a few weeks, using information from many sources, including predictable weather systems.</p>

<h4>A global impact</h4>



<p>Part of the challenge stems from the fact that many patterns influence weather on the subseasonal scale — and some of them aren’t predictable. One pattern that scientists have been targeting lately, hoping to improve predictions of it, is a phenomenon known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO.</p>



<p>The MJO isn’t as well-known as El Niño, but it is just as important in driving global weather. A belt of thunderstorms that typically starts in the Indian Ocean and travels eastward, the MJO can happen several times a year.</p>



<p>An active MJO influences weather around the globe, including storminess in North America and Europe. Subseasonal forecasts are more likely to be accurate when an MJO is happening because there is a major global weather pattern that will affect weather elsewhere in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>But there’s still a lot of room for prediction improvement. The computer models that simulate weather and climate aren’t very good at capturing all aspects of an MJO. In particular, models have a hard time reproducing what happens to an MJO when it hits Southeast Asia’s mix of islands and ocean known as the Maritime Continent. This realm — which includes Indonesia, the Philippines and New Guinea — is a complex interplay of land and sea that meteorologists struggle to understand. Models typically show an MJO stalling out there rather than continuing to travel eastward, when in reality, the storms usually keep going.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Distant effects </h3>



<p>The Madden-Julian Oscillation is a pattern of storms that usually forms several times a year in tropical latitudes and can have weather repercussions around the globe. The MJO travels eastward along the equator as winds push warm, wet air high into the atmosphere, where the air dries out, cools and descends back toward the surface.</p>



<h6>Madden-Julian Oscillation</h6>

</div>



<p>At Stony Brook University in New York, meteorologist Hyemi Kim has been trying to understand why models fail around the Maritime Continent. Many of the models simulate too much light precipitation in the tropics, she found. That light drizzle dries out the lower atmosphere, contributing to the overly dry conditions favored in these models. As a result, when the MJO reaches the Maritime Continent, the dryness of most models <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JD031139">prevents the system from marching eastward</a>, Kim and colleagues reported in August 2019 in the<em> Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</em>. In real life, that rain doesn’t happen. With this better understanding of the difference between models and observations in this region, researchers hope to build better forecasts for how a particular MJO might influence weather around the world.</p>



<p>“If you can predict the MJO better, then you can predict the weather better,” Becker says. Fortunately, scientists are already making those tweaks, by developing finer-grained computer models that do a better job capturing how the atmosphere churns in real life.</p>



<p>Meteorologist Victor Gensini of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb led a recent project to use the MJO, among other factors, to forecast tornado outbreaks in the central and eastern United States two to three weeks in advance. As the MJO moves across and out of the Maritime Continent, it triggers stronger circulation patterns that push air toward higher latitudes. The jet stream strengthens over the Pacific Ocean, setting up long-range patterns that are ultimately conducive to tornadoes east of the Rocky Mountains. In the June <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>, Gensini’s team showed that it can <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/101/6/E700/345594/The-Extended-Range-Tornado-Activity-Forecast-ERTAF">predict broad patterns of U.S. tornado activity</a> two to three weeks ahead of time.</p>



<h4>High above the poles</h4>



<p>Another weather pattern that might help improve subseasonal forecasts is a quick rise in temperature in the stratosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere, above the Arctic or Antarctic. These “sudden stratospheric warming” events happen once every couple of years in the Northern Hemisphere and much less often in the Southern Hemisphere. But when one shows up, it affects weather worldwide. Shortly after a northern stratosphere warming, for instance, extreme storms often arrive in the United States.</p>



<p>In August 2019, one of these rare southern warmings, the largest in 17 years, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02858-0">began over the South Pole</a>. Temperatures soared by nearly 40 degrees Celsius, and wind speeds dropped dramatically. This event shifted lower-level winds around Antarctica toward the north, where they raised temperatures and dried out parts of eastern Australia. That helped set up the tinder-dry conditions that led to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-may-make-australia-wildfires-more-common">devastating heat and fires across Australia</a> in late 2019 and early 2020 (<em>SN: 2/1/20, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Thanks to advanced computer models, forecasters at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne saw the stratospheric warming coming nearly three weeks in advance. That allowed them to predict warm and dry conditions that were conducive to fire, says Harry Hendon, a meteorologist at the bureau.</p>



<p>Stratospheric warming events last for several months. As with an MJO, a subseasonal forecast made while one of them is happening tends to be more accurate, because the stratospheric warming affects weather on the timescale of weeks to months. Meteorologists call such periods “forecasts of opportunity,” because they represent times when forecasts are likely to be more skillful. It’s like how it’s easier to predict your favorite baseball team’s chances for the season if you know they’ve just hired the best free agent around.</p>





<h4>A clearer picture</h4>



<p>Now, researchers are pushing wherever they can to eke out improvements in subseasonal forecasts. The European forecast center where Vitart is based has been issuing subseasonal predictions since 2004, which have been improving with time. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began issuing similar predictions in 2017; they are not as accurate as the European forecasts, but have been getting better over time. Meanwhile, scientists have launched two big efforts to compare the various forecasts.</p>



<p>Vitart and Robertson lead one such project, under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. Known as S2S, the meteorological shorthand for “subseasonal to seasonal,” the project collects subseasonal forecasts from 11 weather prediction agencies around the world, including the European center and NOAA. The forecasts go into an enormous database that researchers can study to see which ones performed well and why. Kim, for instance, used the database, among others, to understand why models have a hard time capturing the MJO’s march across the Maritime Continent.</p>



<p>The second effort, known as SubX, for the Subseasonal Experiment, uses forecasts from seven models produced by U.S. and Canadian research groups. Unlike S2S, SubX operates in nearly real time, allowing forecasters to see how their subseasonal predictions pan out as weather develops.</p>



<p>That proved useful in early 2019, when SubX forecasts foresaw, weeks before it happened, the severe cold snap that hit the United States in late January and early February. Temperatures dropped to the lowest in more than two decades in some places, and more than 20 people died in Wisconsin, Michigan and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Having an extra week’s heads-up that extreme weather is coming can be huge, Robertson says. It gives decision makers the time they need to assess what to do — whether that’s watering crops, moving emergency supplies into place or prepping for disease outbreaks.</p>



<p>In just one example, Robertson and colleagues recently developed detailed <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JD031374">subseasonal forecasts of monsoon rains over northern India</a>. He and Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at Columbia University, described the work in January in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</em>.</p>

<p>In 2018, the scientists focused on the Indian state of Bihar, where the regions north of the Ganges River are flood-prone and the regions to the south are drought-prone. Every week from June through September, the team worked with the India Meteorology Department in New Delhi to produce subseasonal rainfall forecasts for each of Bihar’s regions. The forecasts went to the state’s agricultural universities for distribution to local farmers. So when the summer monsoon rains arrived nearly 16 days later than usual, farmers were able to delay planting their rice and other crops until closer to the time of the monsoon, Acharya says. Such subseasonal forecasts can save farmers both time and money, since they don’t need to pay for irrigation when it’s not needed.</p>



<p>Acharya is now working with meteorologists in Bangladesh to develop similar subseasonal forecasts for that country. There the monsoon rains typically start around the second week in June but can fluctuate — creating uncertainty for farmers trying to decide when to plant. “If we can predict the monsoon onset by around the mid or end of May, it will be huge,” Acharya says.</p>

Acharya</span></figure></div>



<p>Subseasonal forecasts can also help farmers improve productivity in regions such as western Africa, says Shraddhanand Shukla, a climate scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He leads a new NASA-funded project that is kicking off to help farmers better time their crop planting and watering. The effort will combine satellite images of agricultural regions with subseasonal forecasts out to 45 days. If farmers in Senegal had such information in hand back in 2002, Shukla says, they could have better managed their plantings in the run-up to a drought that killed many crops.</p>



<p>As global temperatures rise and climate changes, meteorologists need to keep pushing their models to predict weather as accurately as possible as far in advance as possible, Vitart says. He thinks that researchers may eventually be able to issue forecasts 45 to 50 days in the future — but it may take a decade or more to get to that point. New techniques, such as machine learning that can quickly winnow through multiple forecasts and pinpoint the most accurate one, may be able to accelerate that timeline.</p>



<p>“There’s no single breakthrough,” Becker says. “But there are a lot of little breakthroughs to be made, all of which are going to help.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mandatory-mail-in-voting-democrat-republican-candidates">Mandatory mail-in voting hurts neither Democratic nor Republican candidates</a></h4>

<p>Mandatory mail-in voting leads to a slight uptick in voter turnout — for both Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<p>That’s the conclusion that researchers came to after analyzing more than 40 million individual voting records from Utah and Washington — two states that have switched from in-person voting to almost exclusively mail-in voting over several years — as well as nearly 30 years of nationwide county-level voting data.</p>



<p>The finding, published August 26 in <em>Science Advances, </em>suggests the current political zeitgeist that <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7685">mail-in voting benefits one party over another is false</a>, says political scientist Michael Barber of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. When voters cast ballots by mail, he says, “neither party is hurt.”</p>



<p>Although Utah and Washington do not reflect voting patterns in the country as a whole, the authors note, because Washington leans blue and Utah red, the two states demonstrate how mail-in voting could affect voter turnout by party. </p>





<p>With the country in the midst of a pandemic, policy makers and public health experts have proposed voluntary mail-in voting as one way for Americans to safely vote in November. And many states have made such voting easier. A recent <em>Washington Post</em> analysis shows that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/?itid=ap_katerabinowitz&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_8">over 80 percent of voters in the country can now cast their ballots by mail</a>.</p>



<p>But some Republican voters especially are wary of the process. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx">Gallup poll from May 2020</a> found that 83 percent of Democratic respondents were OK with their state allowing all residents to vote by mail, but only 40 percent of Republicans were. In a separate question, 76 percent of Republicans said mail-in voting would lead to more fraud compared with 27 percent of Democrats. </p>



<p>Barber and John Holbein, a political scientist and public policy expert at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, combed through multiple datasets to understand how mail-in voting has influenced voter turnout overall and by party in recent decades. The researchers first identified counties in six states that adopted more universal mail-in voting procedures from 1992 to 2018, namely mailing all constituents a ballot before Election Day and limiting or eliminating in-person voting. Those states were Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Colorado and Nebraska.</p>



<p>Using census data, the researchers identified the total number of eligible voters in the counties that adopted mail-in voting and those nationwide that did not. The team then compared voter turnout across counties by looking at election data showing how many eligible voters actually cast a ballot in each midterm or presidential election during that quarter century. Barber and Holbein also compared turnout within a given county before and after the implementation of a vote-by-mail policy. Another dataset, Dave Leip’s Atlas of Elections, enabled the researchers to evaluate each party’s share of votes per county in midterm and presidential elections.</p>



<p>The researchers then drilled down into individual voting patterns for Washington and Utah. Altogether, the researchers evaluated more than 40 million voting records from 2012 to 2018 in Utah and from 2002 to 2016 in Washington.</p>



<p>The individual data from Washington and Utah showed voter turnout increased slightly for Democrat, Republican and independent voters. And the county-level analysis likewise showed that mail-in voting led to a 1.8 to 2.9 percentage point increase in voter turnout.</p>



<p>Partisan vote shares in counties that adopted mail-in voting tilted 0.7 percentage points in favor of the Democratic Party, the team found. But with the margin of error in the results between –0.7 and 2 percentage points, that increase was not statistically significant and could potentially go in either direction in any given election, Barber says. As it was, only 1.5 percent of analyzed counties had an electoral margin as narrow as 0.7 percentage points between parties anyway, the authors say.</p>



<p>The authors used “best statistical practices” by corroborating their nationwide, county-level results with the individual results from Washington and Utah, says Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. But “I’m not sure that Republican leaders would be willing to concede 0.7 percentage points,” he says.  </p>



<p>Broad geographic analyses of this sort can obscure smaller communities, adds political scientist Jean Schroedel of Claremont Graduate University in California. Her work shows that mail-in voting disenfranchises Native Americans on reservations, many of whom lack regular mail access and have a long-standing distrust of nontribal government entities. “Native people don’t trust voting — full stop — but they really don’t trust voting by mail,” Schroedel says.</p>



<p>Even if states sort out how to protect the vote of vulnerable community members, such as keeping some physical polling places open, the findings may do little to allay other recent concerns over mail-in voting, Barber acknowledges. Those include fears over the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">United States Post Office’s ability to keep pace</a> with such a huge influx of mail and the possibility of mail-in ballots getting thrown out for <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90534923/voting-by-mail-is-secure-but-it-has-a-seriously-low-tech-downside-your-signature">having an allegedly faulty signature</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness">arriving late</a>.  </p>



<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen in 2020 with vote by mail,” Barber says. “This has gotten so unnecessarily messy.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-immune-system-elite-controllers">In a first, a person’s immune system fought HIV — and won</a></h4>

<p>Some rare people may essentially be able to cure themselves of HIV infections.</p>



<p>Twice, people infected with HIV have had levels of the virus in their bodies drop to undetectable levels after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/second-hiv-patient-remission-stem-cell-transplant">bone marrow transplants</a>, never to return (<em>SN: 3/5/19</em>). Now it appears that a person may have cleared functional HIV with no outside help. If true, it would be the first known instance of a spontaneous cure.</p>



<p>Analysis of more than 1.5 billion cells taken from a patient known as EC2 showed no functional HIV copies in any of them, researchers report August 26 in <em>Nature</em>. The person still had some nonfunctional copies of the virus. While no one can say for sure that intact virus isn’t hiding in a cell somewhere in this person’s body, the finding suggests that some people’s immune systems can get the upper hand, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2651-8">essentially eliminating the pernicious and persistent virus</a>.</p>



<p>A second person, EC1, had just one functional copy of HIV in more than 1 billion blood cells analyzed. And that copy of HIV was stuck in what is essentially a genetic supermax prison. That genetic lockup may be key to being able to naturally control the virus.</p>





<p>Those two people are part of a rare group of people known as elite controllers, meaning they are able to maintain very low or undetectable levels of HIV without antiretroviral drugs. These people have no symptoms or clear signs of damage from the virus. “It’s not even that we’re talking about a few months or a few years. It’s extremely long-term,” says Satya Dandekar, an HIV researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. In contrast, for 99.5 percent or more of the world’s 35 million people infected with the virus, drugs are the only way to keep the virus down.</p>



<p>Researchers want to know how elite controllers quash the virus for long periods of time. It has been difficult to figure it out, Dandekar says, because no one has recorded the first fight scenes between HIV and the elite controllers’ immune systems. “We miss the initial punches the immune system has thrown at the virus.” And by the time anyone recognizes an elite controller, the fight is already won.</p>



<p>About a quarter of elite controllers have genetic variants in key immune system genes that may help them get a handle on the virus, says Joseph Wong, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco. But that explains what’s going on in only a minority of elite controllers, and isn’t something easily transferred to others, he says.</p>



<p>It’s possible that the elite controllers were infected with “wimpy” versions of HIV, Dandekar says. So the researchers examined the HIV viruses embedded in DNA from 64 elite controllers and 41 HIV-infected people taking antiretroviral drugs. The elite controllers had maintained undetectable levels of virus without drugs from one to, in EC2’s case, 24 years. The median was nine years.</p>



<p>HIV is a retrovirus, which means that it stores its genetic information as RNA. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase copies those RNA instructions into DNA, which can then insert into the host’s DNA. Reverse transcriptase is error prone, often resulting in defective or incomplete copies of the virus. So the researchers went into the study thinking that elite controllers might be loaded with these nonfunctional versions, which can’t make infectious virus, says Xu Yu, an immunologist at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard in Boston.</p>



<p>“But to our surprise, that’s not the case,” she says. Instead, most elite controllers in the study have more intact virus than expected. So Yu and colleagues looked to see where the virus had landed in patients’ DNA.</p>



<p>In most people infected with HIV, the virus lands near or in genes, thanks to some human proteins that shepherd it there, says Monica Roth, a virologist at Rutgers University Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J. But in the elite controllers, the virus was trapped in gene-poor parts of the human genetic instruction book, or genome. When it did land in or near genes, they were ones that are wrapped in the molecular equivalent of razor wire, which prevents the genes from being turned on. Collectively those inactive, tightly guarded parts of the genome are known as heterochromatin.</p>



<p>Plunking HIV in heterochromatin “is like putting it in the trunk, and then locking the trunk,” says Roth, who was not involved in the work. Those silenced copies of HIV might briefly stir and produce infectious virus, but would mostly be inert.</p>



<p>Yu and colleagues investigated whether elite controllers have a propensity for steering the virus to heterochromatin. But in lab dishes, the guide proteins in elite controllers’ cells still direct HIV insertions in or near genes, just like what happens in the cells of other people.</p>



<p>“It’s probably not that [elite controllers] just got lucky at the beginning of the infection” to get HIV trapped in heterochromatin, says Yu’s Ragon Institute colleague, Mathias Lichterfeld, a virologist and infectious diseases physician. Instead, the researchers think elite controllers’ immune systems eliminated cells producing functional virus, leaving behind only broken copies of the virus and intact versions locked in heterochromatin. Exactly how the immune system manages that feat isn’t known.</p>



<p>“It’s very intriguing that they’re proposing this,” Roth says. “But there’s no evidence saying that it happens.” Even so, she says, the study may hold hope for others infected with HIV.</p>



<p>“Once you figure out the mechanism [by which] this is working, maybe you can figure what goes wrong in everyone else and fine-tune it,” Roth says. The researchers have eliminated some possibilities, but haven’t solved the mystery yet of how elite controllers achieve their status. “The big question is, how do you do it? It’s a cliffhanger in the paper.”</p>

<p>Italy may owe some of its seismic activity to carbon dioxide bubbling up from deep underground.</p>



<p>The country’s central Apennine Mountains region has been rattled by several destructive earthquakes in recent years, including the devastating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shaky-forecasts">magnitude 6.3 quake that wracked the city of L’Aquila</a> in 2009 (<em>SN: 8/14/09</em>). A new decade-long record of natural carbon dioxide emissions in the area reveals that <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc2938">spikes in CO<sub>2</sub> release coincided with the biggest earthquakes</a>. That finding hints that CO<sub>2</sub> rising toward Earth’s surface can change pressure along faults to trigger earthquakes, researchers report online August 26 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Understanding the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and seismicity could someday lead to better earthquake forecasts.</p>



<p>Earth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-earth-stores-its-carbon">naturally releases carbon dioxide</a> when tectonic forces melt carbonate rock in the mantle, a process that frees CO<sub>2</sub> (<em>SN: 10/1/19</em>). That CO<sub>2</sub> rises, gathers in pressurized pockets in Earth’s crust and seeps into groundwater that feeds springs aboveground. Previous studies have noted that CO<sub>2</sub> tends to escape Earth in seismic hot spots. But without long-term records of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in earthquake-prone areas, no one knew exactly how the timing of carbon emissions compared with earthquake occurrence. </p>



<p>From 2009 to 2018, researchers measured the carbon content of springwater fed by the Velino aquifer, which is near the epicenter of the 2009 L’Aquila quake and sits atop a reservoir of CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth’s crust. Those data show that jumps in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions happened at about the same time as strong earthquakes, and emissions dropped off when quakes were smaller and farther between. When the region was struck by quakes of magnitude 6 or higher, the Velino aquifer springs released more than 600 metric tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>per day. During more seismically quiet periods, the springs emitted some 400 to 500 tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>daily.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="San Vittorino spring" class="wp-image-3090794" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082520_mt_earthquakeCO2_inline.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090794">Carbon dioxide from deep within Earth’s mantle can rise up through the crust, seep into groundwater and reach the surface in springwater, such as in the San Vittorino spring (shown) in central Italy.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090794">G. Chiodini/INGV</span></figure>



<p>Still, these data do not conclusively show whether rising CO<sub>2</sub> helps incite earthquakes, or if the shaking ground simply brings more CO<sub>2</sub> to the surface, says Andrea Billi, a geologist at the Italian National Research Council in Rome not involved in the work. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem.” Continuously monitoring these types of carbon dioxide emissions in the Apennines and other seismically active regions, such as California and Japan, could reveal whether uprising gas is a precursor or product of quakes, he says.</p>



<p>“I think there is feedback between the two,” says study coauthor Giovanni Chiodini, a geologist at the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Bologna. Continuous buildup of carbon dioxide underground, he says, could drive earthquakes, which fracture Earth’s crust and allow more CO<sub>2</sub> to creep upward, which in turn generates more quakes.</p>



<p>If uprising CO<sub>2 </sub>does aggravate seismic activity in some areas, then tracking the chemistry of local springwater may offer forecasters a new tool to make their predictions, which scientists did not have when the deadly earthquake took L’Aquila by surprise in 2009, Billi says. In the wake of that disaster, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/italian-earthquake-verdict-exposes-rifts-between-science-and-society">six Italian scientists and a government official were convicted</a> of manslaughter for failing to adequately warn the public of seismic risks in the region — although the defendants were later acquitted or got reduced sentences (<em>SN: 1/23/13</em>).</p>

<p>Outer space is not friendly to life. Extreme temperatures, low pressure and radiation can quickly degrade cell membranes, destroy DNA and kill any life-forms that somehow find themselves in the void.</p>



<p>But by banding together, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02050/full">some bacteria can withstand that harsh environment</a>, shielded from the extremes of space by the group’s outer layers. Microbes huddled in the heart of balls of <em>Deinococcus </em>bacteria as thin as five sheets of paper have survived on the exterior of the International Space Station for three years, researchers report August 26 in <em>Frontiers in Microbiology</em>. Such microbial arks might be able to drift among planets, spreading life through the universe, a concept known as panspermia.</p>



<p>Previous research found that microbes can survive in space when embedded within artificial meteorites. But this is the first study to show that microbes can survive this long unprotected, says Margaret Cramm, a microbiologist at the University of Calgary in Canada who wasn’t involved in the study. “It suggests life can survive on its own in space as a group,” she says, providing another possible avenue for panspermia. It also adds weight to the worry that human space travel <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-rules-guarding-other-planets-contamination-may-be-too-strict">could unintentionally introduce life to other planets</a> (<em>SN:10/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>Akihiko Yamagishi, an astrobiologist at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Tokyo, and his colleagues sent dried pellets of <em>Deinococcus, </em>radiation-resistant bacteria that thrive in extreme places such as the stratosphere, to space in 2015. The bacteria were stuffed into small wells in metal plates, which NASA astronaut Scott Kelly affixed to the exterior of the space station, and samples were sent back to Earth each year. </p>





<p>Back home, the researchers rehydrated the pellets, gave them bacteria food and waited for growth. After three years in space, bacteria in 100-micrometer-thick pellets didn’t make it. DNA analysis suggested the radiation had fried their genetic material. The outer layers of 500- and 1,000-micrometer-thick pellets were dead too, discolored by ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. But those dead cells shielded inner microbes from the hazards of space. Approximately 4 percent of the microbes in those larger pellets survived, Yamagishi says.</p>



<p>Extrapolating from survival data after one, two and three years of exposure, Yamagishi estimates that 1,000-micrometer pellets could survive eight years floating through space. “That’s enough time to potentially get to Mars,” he says. Some of the speediest, but less common, estimates of flight time of meteors between Earth and Mars suggest the trip could be made in a few months to years.</p>



<p>How exactly clumps of microbes could get expelled into space remains unclear. They might get kicked up by small meteorites, or ejected into space by thunderstorm-induced perturbations to Earth’s magnetic field, Yamagishi says. But such a trip could happen, he says. Someday, if microbial life is ever discovered on Mars, he hopes to look for evidence of such a cosmic journey. “That’s my ultimate dream.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/-NFg9bVWp4w/">Author Interview: Arunima Malik on Global Effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Arunima Malik and an international team of researchers recently assessed how the Coronavirus pandemic has caused worldwide consumption losses amounting to more than US$3.8 trillion while simultaneously spawning the largest recorded drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Their <em>PLOS ONE </em>paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235654"><em>Global socio-economic losses and environmental gains from the Coronavirus pandemic</em>,</a>” highlights the inherent dilemma of the global socio-economic system and the need for increased global cooperation and solidarity. Read on to see their thoughts on the need to move beyond discipline boundaries, the effects of their research on policy and more. </p>



<p><em><strong>The list of authors on this article spans the globe, with researchers affiliated with Australia, Japan, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, United States, and the United Kingdom. Can you speak on how this team was formed?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: The assessment presented in our published study was undertaken in the Global Industrial Ecological Virtual Laboratory — a cloud computing environment that brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and universities to foster new and innovative research.</p>



<p>We formed the multi-regional multi-disciplinary team to allow us to capture insights and data related to COVID-19 for not just English, but also for a range of languages. We followed a three-tier approach to enable us to best capture global events related to the pandemic. We note in the manuscript: “In addition to English, and in alphabetical order, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish were used in our search, thus covering languages spoken by over 5 billion people.”</p>



<p><em><strong>What drives you in your field of research, and why do you believe your research is important?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: I am passionate about understanding impacts embodied in complex supply chains. It’s important to be able to understand how systems are interconnected, and how effects in one system ripple through other systems. Sustainability applies to us all, and I enjoy being able to contribute to this evolving field of research. Regarding the current pandemic, these ripple effects have been further emphasized on a global scale. </p>



<p><em><strong>How crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of your research? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: My research is interdisciplinary as it brings together concepts and methodologies from a range of disciplines. It is therefore important to have structures that support interdisciplinary review and dissemination of results. There is a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research for understanding complex sustainability-related issues.</p>



<p><em><strong>What impact is your research having in your scientific community, in the media, and more widely? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: Research in supply chain analysis is definitely gaining relevance, and we are now starting to see the use of input-output tables by organisations for sustainability assessments. Input output analysis has been used in the reports published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Stockholm Environment Institute — such as the report on the <a href="https://www.sei.org/publications/spillovers-sdg-implementation-soy-argentina/">Argentina-EU soy supply chain</a> regarding impacts on Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr.</em> <em><a href="https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/people/bing-xue">Bing Xue</a>, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany, speaks on the importance of Arunima’s research and supply chain analyses. </em></p>



<p>BX: The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, triggering a great debate in the economic circles on the impact of the epidemic. As a result of the lockdown and other measures taken by various countries to deal with the pandemic, the supply chain at the enterprise level was disrupted, which led to the shutdown of global value chain trade, specifically in terms of consumption loss, income loss and employment loss. At the same time, due to the ripple effect of supply chain disruption, some polluting companies have reduced output, reducing GHG and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which has a positive impact on the environment. </p>



<p>Looking at the world as a cohesive whole, global MRIO-based supply-chain analyses helps to clearly understand the different impacts on countries in different positions of global value chain. The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on some important conditions for the rise and rapid progress of economic globalization, stimulating the restructuring of global value chains. </p>



<p>What is more important is the orderly development of economic globalization after the pandemic. Based on the perspective of the global industrial chain, how to cope with the impact of the outbreak and spread of the pandemic on the supply chain is an issue that should be concerned by the scientific community.</p>



<p><em>I would like to thank Arunima and Bing for their research and for taking the time to provide their thoughtful comments. </em></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We’ve all had the experience of losing our temper when being treated unfairly by someone else. And while anger isn’t the most pleasant emotion, it can be a useful social tool to signal to another person that we’re not happy with how they’re acting towards us.</p>



<p>But what about when we suffer because of bad luck, rather someone else’s actions? In that case it would seem to make little sense to get mad. And yet, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304967">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences </em>finds that a certain group of people are more likely to show anger in such situations: those who feel like they are particularly entitled in the first place.</p>


<p><span id="more-40124"></span></p>


<p>Psychological entitlement is essentially a belief that you deserve more than others. People who score highly in entitlement tend to think that others should be accommodating of their own needs and schedules, for instance, and are more likely to see themselves as being mistreated. When their high expectations aren’t met, they can experience reduced wellbeing and feelings of anger.</p>



<p>In a series of studies, Emily Zitek from Cornell University and Alexander Jordan from Harvard Medical School looked at whether these emotional effects of entitlement extend to situations solely involving bad luck. First, the pair asked 162 participants to fill in the Psychological Entitlement Scale, which asks respondents to rate their agreement with statements like “I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others”.  Participants were also asked how good they would expect their luck to normally be when rolling dice.</p>



<p>Participants were then told that they would be randomly allocated by dice roll to either a fun task (rating comic strips) or a boring task (counting the letters in a paragraph). In reality, all participants were told they had had “bad luck” and been assigned to the boring task. They then rated how unjust they felt this was, and indicated how angry they were.</p>



<p>The team found that those higher in entitlement had a stronger feeling of injustice and greater levels of anger. More entitled participants also generally expected to experience better luck when rolling dice, suggesting this is another instance where entitled people have (unrealistically) high expectations.</p>



<p>In a second study, participants were asked to recall either a time when something bad had happened to them solely because of bad luck, or when someone had treated them unfairly. They then indicated how fair and just they felt the event was, and rated their feelings of anger. </p>



<p>People high in entitlement again showed greater anger than those low in entitlement when recalling an instance of bad luck. But when remembering an instance of unfair treatment, those high and low in entitlement showed similar levels of anger. That is, entitlement again seemed to be an important factor in determining anger after bad luck, but not when there was a specific individual to blame.</p>



<p>Finally, the researchers looked at how entitlement related to feelings of anger and pity when <em>someone else</em> experiences bad luck. Participants read a scenario in which their flight had been cancelled and the airline was randomly selecting a customer to hop onto another plane with a spare seat. In one scenario they were told that they had been unlucky and someone else had been picked; in another they were the lucky one.</p>



<p>When the participants read that they had had bad luck, higher entitlement was once again related to greater feelings of anger. Unsurprisingly, participants didn’t feel much anger when they were assigned the seat and the other person was unlucky. But they did experience pity towards that person — and interestingly, those with a greater sense of entitlement reported <em>less</em> pity.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the studies suggest that entitled people expect to have good luck, and get angry after experiencing bad luck — even though by definition there is no-one to direct that anger towards. (The authors do acknowledge it’s possible that people implicitly blame God or some higher power for their bad luck).</p>



<p>So what are the consequences of experiencing anger in those situations? The researchers suggest that feelings of anger and injustice could reinforce people’s sense of entitlement, though they add that there could be benefits too — if anger motivates someone to try and improve their performance in the future, for instance (though that may be difficult in cases where a bad result is purely down to luck).</p>



<p>Similarly, it remains to be seen how the results translate to the real world. In most cases an instance of “bad luck” doesn’t occur in isolation, but often in a social setting — so it would seem prudent to examine whether this kind of anger is taken out on others.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></h4>

<p>In a previous <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">post</a> I described topics of conversations to have with a teenager leaving home for college. Equally, if not more important, is the process of communication.</p><p><strong>Understand the positive power of a strong family foundation</strong>. The power of a supportive family is almost unlimited.  Let me be clear that a family does not need to consist of a heterosexual mother and father, 2.5 children, and a golden retriever. A family is a group of people who are committed to one another for the long run, based on their love. If students understand that no matter what, they can depend on their family, any transition will be easier. Research supports this view: the same study of anxiety and depression during the pandemic revealed that family support was associated with fewer psychological disorders.</p><p><strong>Develop your family communication skills.</strong>  The first step in the communication process may sound simple at first: listen. Too many parents, especially when anxious, tend to lecture, perhaps the worst possible strategy for communicating with teens.  You can express your emotions first, not to meet your needs but to normalize a conversation about feelings.  A parent can open a conversation with a statement like,  “I know this is a hard time for most of us, and I know I’m a bit worried. How are you feeling?” In this way, you acknowledge that it is OK to be frightened or anxious. Listening takes time, accepting some silence, and it isn’t always easy. Your teen may brush you off at first—that’s okay, there will be other opportunities. Keep the lines of communication.</p><p><strong>Accept that communication may change</strong>. Flexibility will be key for a positive transition to college.  You may hear from your child less often: embrace that as growth. He is learning to depend on other people for support, expanding his social world.  He may primarily use texting or short phone calls when he’s walking.  You also have the right to let your child know that you need to hear from them now and then.  But don’t invade their space by reading their Instagram or Twitter. You can respect their privacy and if you want to learn more about campus life, subscribe to the student newspaper or check the college website. Other students, especially during these uncertain times, may want to stay connected and text or call often. If you already text or talk on the phone with your teen frequently, the contact may stay the same or increase. They are letting you know what they need. There is no absolute right or wrong rate of communication, especially during the first few months of the college transition.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. It is axiomatic in mental health that if a parent feels psychologically healthy, so will a child.  To support your student, they need to feel that you are OK, that they can leave knowing that the situation at home is solid. This doesn’t mean that your family will be free of stress, but that you will be able to cope or find solutions to problems that arise. This is called “self-efficacy.” You may have lost your job or suffered financial setbacks during this time, or worse, lost a loved one to COVID-19. And you are probably going to miss your child. You may be under additional pressure if you are a single parent, a member of a minority group, or if you work on the front lines of healthcare or a service industry. It also appears that mothers who work outside the home may also be doing the lion’s share of the housework and educational needs of their children. Try to take time for yourself by establishing <strong>daily</strong> relaxing rituals, like short meditations or breathing exercises or listening to music. Reach out to your partner, a close friend or relative for support. Just as your child needs care, so do you.</p><p>This is a time for all of us to focus on values, on what matters most. For most of us, family and education are fundamental. Parents can help their college-age children move through this unexpectedly difficult transition, and we all need to take care of one another.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit:<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/lovely-teenage-with-grandmother-home_5432734.htm"> Image</a> by jcomp via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/634481516/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/dont-blame-ai-for-the-a-levels-scandal/" rel="nofollow">Don’t blame AI for the A-Levels scandal</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-patient-convalescent-plasma-treatment">COVID-19 plasma treatments may be safe, but we don’t know if they work</a></h4>

<p>With emergency permission for using plasma donated by recovered COVID-19 patients to treat sick ones, some researchers are once again raising concerns that the push for speed is getting ahead of the science.</p>



<p>No randomized controlled trials have shown that convalescent plasma works against COVID-19 yet. Even so, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced August 23 that it would allow convalescent plasma to be used under an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma">emergency use authorization</a>. That move has some experts worried that an unproven treatment may interfere with other more promising therapies, and may make it harder to find out if convalescent plasma really can help against COVID-19.</p>



<p>The authorization came less than a week after the <em>New York Times</em> reported that top National Institutes of Health officials were<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/blood-plasma-covid-19.html"> trying to stop an emergency use authorization for plasma</a>, citing concerns about lack of sufficient data. On August 22, President Donald Trump tweeted dissatisfaction with the pace of FDA approval for new vaccines and therapies to fight COVID-19. </p>



<p>While convalescent plasma appears safe, and there are hints that it may help people in early stages of the disease, not enough data have been amassed to say that the treatment is effective, some experts warn.</p>





<p>“We lack the randomized controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in COVID-19 treatment,” Thomas File Jr., president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement August 23. There’s a need “to better understand the benefits of convalescent plasma treatment before authorizing its wider use in patients with COVID-19.”</p>



<p>Here’s what the studies have told us so far about using convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients and what we still need to learn.</p>



<h4>What is convalescent plasma?</h4>



<p>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood taken from people who have recovered from an infection, in this case from COVID-19. Plasma contains antibodies that people have built against the pathogen.</p>



<p>It has been used for decades, with mixed success, to treat other types of infections, including influenza and Ebola. That’s why, early on in the coronavirus pandemic, it was eyed as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-can-plasma-recovered-patients-treat-sick">a potential treatment</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/20</em>).</p>

<p>In the United States, researchers set up clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of giving patients plasma from COVID-19 survivors; it has also been given in compassionate use situations, in which a person wasn’t able to join a clinical trial. Plasma from recovered COVID-19  patients has also been used in other countries as a possible therapy.</p>



<h4>What does emergency use authorization mean?</h4>



<p>Emergency use authorization gives physicians permission to use an experimental therapy in certain circumstances. It is not the same as FDA approval. There are no FDA approved therapies for COVID-19.</p>



<p>Under the new emergency use rules, researchers can still test convalescent plasma in clinical trials. Use of survivors’ plasma can also be extended to people with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 who aren’t eligible for clinical trials. That was previously possible only for certain patients at select hospitals. But now, doctors in places that don’t normally have access to plasma can apply to get plasma for individual patients. </p>



<p>Emergency use authorization can be withdrawn, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-canceled-emergency-use-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-coronavirus">as was the case for hydroxychloroquine</a>. The FDA rescinded emergency use authorization for the antimalarial drug in June after multiple studies found no benefit to using it (<em>SN: 6/15/20</em>).</p>



<h4>Is convalescent plasma safe?</h4>



<p>It’s generally considered safe for its standard uses. So far the evidence suggests that’s the case for treating COVID-19, says Liise-anne Pirofski, an infectious diseases physician and immunologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.</p>



<p>A study of 5,000 patients published June 11 in the<em> Journal of Clinical Investigation </em> found serious adverse events, such as allergic reactions or transfusion-related lung injury, <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/140200">occurred less than 1 percent of the time</a>. Larger studies that haven’t yet been peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1.full.pdf">showed similar results</a>.</p>



<p>“The safety is the same as that of standard plasma, which is used every day in hospitals,” Pirofski says.</p>



<h4>Does it work?</h4>



<p>So far, there aren’t enough data to tell.</p>



<p>The idea is that patients who are ill with COVID-19 could benefit from the antibodies made by others who successfully fought off the virus.</p>



<p>The research that seems to have tipped the scales toward authorization of emergency use came from a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1.full.pdf">preliminary study of 35,000 patients </a>posted August 12 at medRxiv.org. At a news conference announcing the EUA, Trump said the study “has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-23-2020/">That’s a tremendous number</a>.”</p>



<p>FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn added “what that means is, and if the data continue to pan out, 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.”</p>



<p>That number appears to come from a subset of the results, and misrepresents what the data actually say.</p>



<p>In a group of about 3,000 patients, researchers compared the mortality of patients who received plasma with high and low levels, or titres, of antibodies at different stages of illness. Of people who got plasma with high levels of antibodies, 8.9 percent died, on average, after seven days of treatment. That’s compared with the 13.7 percent of people who got plasma with low levels of antibodies who died in that time frame.</p>



<p>That study also suggested that earlier treatment was better. On average, 8.7 percent of people who got convalescent plasma within three days of being diagnosed with COVID-19 died within seven days. But waiting until four days or more after diagnosis to start convalescent plasma therapy was associated with 11.9 percent mortality in the seven-day window. That’s a relative difference of about 35 percent, but the absolute difference in mortality is much smaller, about 3.2 percentage points. In other words, about 3 in 100 people would be helped by convalescent plasma therapy here, not 35. Hahn acknowledged in a tweet August 24<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1298071620414824452?s=20"> that he conflated absolute and relative risk</a>.</p>



<p>Looking out to 30 days after treatment, 21.6 percent of the early treatment group died compared with 26.7 percent of those who got treated later.</p>





<h4>What do other studies tell us?</h4>



<p>There is still a lot to sort out.</p>



<p>Who should get access to the limited supply of plasma is a big issue. A study in the Netherlands found that most patients who have been ill for 10 days are <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20139857v1">already making their own antibodies</a> against the virus. The study was testing convalescent plasma but stopped early because 53 of 66 patients in the study already had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Researchers reported those preliminary results July 3 at medRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Adding additional antibodies probably won’t help those already producing their own, and plasma should be reserved for people who aren’t making antibodies yet, the researchers suggest. But other researchers studying convalescent plasma’s effect have not seen preexisting antibodies in most patients, says James Musser, an infectious diseases pathologist at Houston Methodist Hospital.</p>



<p>Not only do researchers need to determine whether convalescent plasma works for anybody, doctors and scientists also need to figure out who is likely to be helped, who won’t — and why.  “We need to be able to direct our attention to which patients are most likely to benefit from, in this case, frankly, a relatively precious resource of high titre convalescent plasma,” Musser says. </p>



<p>In Houston, he and colleagues saw promising early results from a safety trial of convalescent plasma transfusions for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But that early observation lacked a control group, so the researchers set up another study to compare groups of patients who got convalescent plasma with those who didn’t. Of patients in the study for whom 28 days worth of data are available, 145 patients got convalescent plasma while a control group of 435 did not. There was <a href="https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(20)30370-9/fulltext">a trend toward less death</a> in the group who got plasma, but that effect was not statistically meaningful, the researchers reported August 10 in the <em>American Journal of Pathology</em>.</p>



<p>When researchers broke the data down to look at people who got treatment within 72 hours of being admitted to the hospital and got plasma with high levels of antibodies, they saw a statistically meaningful difference. About 7 percent of those who didn’t get plasma died within 28 days of hospitalization, compared with 1.2 percent of patients who got plasma with high levels of antibody within a couple of days of hospitalization.</p>



<p>Those results also point to early treatment with high levels of antibodies being better. Exactly how much earlier is best is still not known. The group is conducting more analyses on all 316 patients who have gotten plasma treatment so far. Results should be available soon. But, Musser says, he and other scientists are waiting to see the results from randomized, controlled trials before coming to a decision about how well the treatment works, and for whom.</p>



<h4>Will the emergency use authorization interfere with clinical trials?</h4>



<p>It depends.</p>



<p>Hospitalized patients who don’t want to deal with enrolling in a clinical trial, or who don’t want to take a chance that they will be assigned to the placebo group, now have easier access to the treatment, which could mean researchers will have more trouble enrolling participants.</p>



<p>A coalition of researchers in the <a href="https://ccpp19.org/">National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project</a> have set up at least 23 clinical trials testing survivors’ plasma for the ability to treat infections at various stages, or to preempt illness in those exposed to the virus as a preventive treatment. Those studies are either planned or ongoing, though recruiting adequate numbers of people has been challenging. Two studies out of Johns Hopkins University have enrolled only about 10 percent of the 500 to 600 volunteers needed.</p>



<p>“For inpatient studies, the EAU makes studying this treatment more difficult,” says Daniel Hanley, a physician who directs multisite clinical trials at Johns Hopkins.</p>



<p>But the emergency use authorization applies only to hospitalized patients. People with milder COVID-19 cannot get convalescent plasma therapy unless enrolled in a clinical trial. “The EUA may increase awareness of convalescent plasma as a treatment that seems pretty safe,” says Shmuel Shoham, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins who is involved in clinical trials there. That could help recruitment for trials testing whether plasma therapy could be used as a prophylactic.</p>



<h4>What don’t we know?</h4>



<p>There’s still a lot researchers don’t know about how and when convalescent plasma therapy could be effective in treating, or preventing, COVID-19. Some evidence suggests that plasma with higher titres of antibodies are more effective, but more detailed information on how much plasma is needed for different patients would help clinicians, Pirofski says.</p>



<p>And the product itself can vary a lot — yet another factor that makes clinical trials challenging. Because people produce widely varying levels and types of antibodies after a COVID-19 infection, plasma taken from those people will also be different, says Suresh Vedantham, a clinical researcher who oversees COVID-19 trials at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “That’s a big X factor,” making it difficult to compare outcomes between patients treated with plasma from different donors.</p>

<p>Musser wants to know what went wrong for that 1.2 percent of patients in his study who got high levels of antibodies within 72 hours of hospitalization but still died. It’s also important to understand whether plasma can benefit people with health conditions that put them at greater risk of dying from COVID-19.</p>



<p>And researchers may need to compare plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with plasma that doesn’t contain those antibodies, Musser says. That would help determine whether there are other materials in plasma that help fight the infection, or if antibodies are really the active ingredient. If antibodies alone are important, it’s possible that giving purified monoclonal antibodies, which can be made in large quantities in labs, might be better than harvesting plasma from donors. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">studies of such monoclonal antibodies</a> are also under way (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers also still need to fully answer who benefits most from convalescent plasma treatment. Early evidence hints that plasma therapy works best in younger patients, but more data are needed. And while currently available data on efficacy were enough to authorize emergency use, scientists still only have a limited and fuzzy picture of just how much plasma therapy can help. Pirofski says it’s easier to feel confident about the answers to these questions when there are robust clinical trials with placebo controls.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><em>You were hoping to go out with friends on Saturday night, but your partner really wants to have a quiet night at home instead…</em></p>



<p><em>Your life’s going great, but then your partner is offered their dream job in a town you’d happily never visit, let alone live in…</em></p>



<p>So what do you do? Do you stand your ground? Or you do you sacrifice your own goals for the sake of your partner’s?</p>



<p>It’s a dilemma familiar to anyone who’s ever been in a relationship. It would seem reasonable, then, to assume that research could tell us what the likely impacts would be on individual wellbeing, and on the health of the relationship itself. However, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-51177-001">new paper</a> published in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> point out, there are two conflicting hypotheses for how sacrifices should pan out.</p>


<p><span id="more-40117"></span></p>


<p>The “benefit hypothesis” holds that making sacrifices can relieve tension in a relationship and help to build a climate of trust and cooperation. According to the “burden hypothesis”, however, when one partner sacrifices a personal goal, and compromises on their autonomy, their own wellbeing takes a hit.</p>



<p>Francesca Righetti at the Free University of Amsterdam led work that set out to look at what actually happens. And the results are fascinating: if you feel that you would <em>in theory</em> be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just <em>says</em> that they would), it’s a different story.</p>



<p>Righetti and her colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 82 sets of data on sacrifice and wellbeing in relationships, comprising more than 32,000 people. Only some of the data, collected in nine different countries, had previously been published, and just over half of the data sets came from studies that included same-sex couples, with the rest exclusively focused on mixed-sex couples. The team looked at four different facets of sacrifice: willingness to sacrifice (saying that in theory, you would), behavioural sacrifice (actually sacrificing), satisfaction with a sacrifice and costs of a sacrifice.</p>



<p>They found that when someone reported being willing to make a particular hypothetical sacrifice for their romantic partner, this was linked not only to higher personal wellbeing (more positive emotional states and greater life satisfaction) but also higher “relationship wellbeing” scores both from that individual and also their partner.</p>



<p>The results in relation to actual sacrifices were striking, though. Though the relationship wellbeing scores weren’t affected, the individual’s personal wellbeing ratings were lower when they made more frequent sacrifices.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that reporting a general willingness to sacrifice and actually regularly making sacrifices for your partner are two very different things — a reported willingness “may only weakly correspond to actually performing these sacrifices in everyday life,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>The data did also reveal, however, that when people said they gained  satisfaction from giving up their own goals and preferences in favour of their partner’s, they tended (unsurprisingly) to report more positive personal and also relationship wellbeing than if they had not felt satisfied with their sacrifice. Similarly, when the personal costs of a sacrifice were reported to be higher, the individual’s personal and relationship wellbeing scores also tended to be lower. (This difference may relate simply to the size of the sacrifice — going with your partner’s plans for Saturday night vs agreeing to move to another town or country, for example.)</p>



<p>“Thus,” the team writes, “although results aligned with the benefit hypothesis when considering willingness to sacrifice and satisfaction with sacrifice, data were consistent with the burden hypothesis when considering behavioural sacrifices and costs of sacrifice.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found some gender-related effects. The associations between all four facets of sacrifice and personal and relationship wellbeing were more negative for women than for men. Why? The team suggests that women typically make more sacrifices than men do and so, when they do sacrifice, they may receive less appreciation and gratitude from their partner, and also society in general, than men. Consequently, women may have less positive attitudes towards sacrifice than men, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Why, though, should a reported <em>willingness</em> to sacrifice be linked to various benefits, when actual sacrifices were not?</p>



<p>Feeling willing, in theory, to sacrifice may of course be linked to having a stronger relationship in the first place. Also, people who feel like this may be generally more prosocial in other ways, which could enhance their partner’s own wellbeing and perceptions of the relationship itself. </p>



<p>So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-newborn-baby-survival-doctor-race-mortality-rate-disparity">What we can learn from how a doctor’s race can affect Black newborns’ survival</a></h4>

<p>At the beginning of life, babies face racial health disparities that imperil their survival. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/NVSR-69-7-508.pdf">infant mortality rate in the United States</a> is more than twice as high for Black infants as it is for white infants: 10.8 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 4.6 per 1,000 as of 2018, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Now a study suggests that when Black newborns are treated by Black physicians after birth, the mortality disparity between Black and white babies shrinks. Why a doctor’s race makes a difference remains a complicated question. But the answers may point to how to make sure the best care is available to all babies from all doctors.</p>



<p>Health disparities are differences in health that are tied to economic, social or environmental disadvantages. The inequities that fuel these disparities include differences in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medicaid-expansion-health-gaps-black-white-babies">access to health care</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/19</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">exposure to pollution</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>) and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-words-acts-el-paso-shooting-harm-children-health-longterm">health effects of racism</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/19</em>).  </p>



<p>Even with gains in insurance coverage this past decade, Black Americans are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur202005-508.pdf">less likely to have insurance</a> than white Americans: In the first half of 2019, 13.6 percent of Black adults were uninsured, compared with 9.8 percent of white adults, according to the CDC. And researchers reported in April that fewer Black women than white women have <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2020/04000/Racial_and_Ethnic_Disparities_in_Perinatal.20.aspx">uninterrupted insurance coverage</a> before, during and after pregnancy. Beyond access to health care are the health harms that stem from structural racism. The historical, racist practice of redlining neighborhoods has been linked to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7287548/">risk of preterm birth</a> and more <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31999951/">emergency room visits due to asthma</a>. Leaving a segregated neighborhood may lead to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-you-live-can-affect-your-blood-pressure-study-suggests">drop in blood pressure</a> (<em>SN: 5/15/17</em>).</p>





<p>Even encounters between a doctor and patient can be overshadowed by bias. For example, Black Americans are less likely than white Americans to receive sufficient treatment for pain. A 2016 study found that some medical students and doctors falsely believed there are biological differences in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296/tab-figures-data#abstract-2">amount of pain</a> Black Americans experience compared with white Americans, which affected treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>Studies have begun to explore whether receiving care from a physician who shares the same race or gender as the patient, called concordance, makes a difference. There’s evidence that this could increase rapport between doctors and adult patients and increase patients’ willingness to take medicines or participate in disease screening. But less is known about what this means for patients’ health. That’s where the new study of Black newborns sheds some light; it suggests that for these babies, care from a Black physician does indeed matter.</p>



<p>Researchers examined data on hospital births in Florida from 1992 to 2015, and found that when attended by white physicians, Black newborns experienced 430 more deaths per 100,000 births than white newborns. But when cared for by a Black physician, the excess deaths dropped to 173 per 100,000 above that of white newborns, the team reports August 17 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. In other words, under the care of a Black physician, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/12/1913405117">a Black newborn’s “mortality penalty” is cut by more than half.</a></p>



<p>Even so, Black newborns still died at a higher rate than white newborns; a doctor’s race is only one strand of many that can entwine to create disparities. Nor does the study suggest that Black newborns should receive treatment only from Black physicians, the researchers say.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked with two of the researchers who conducted the study: Rachel Hardeman, a reproductive health equity researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis, and Brad Greenwood of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who studies public and population health. The interview was edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Why do Black patients have poorer health outcomes than white patients?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hardeman:</strong> The fundamental cause of health inequities in our society is racism, [which] takes a lot of different shapes and forms.</p>



<p>One of the things that’s been well-discussed within maternal [and] child health is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470581/#r2">weathering hypothesis</a>, how different forms of racism and the cumulative disadvantage due to racism across the life course contribute to early aging, cellular aging. That really brings Black birthing people into pregnancy looking physiologically older than they are.… This idea of toxic stress due to racism and socioeconomic disadvantage across one’s life can lead to wear and tear on the body that puts Black people at a disadvantage with respect to their health.</p>



<p>The weathering hypothesis is incredibly important and salient, but we also have to be thinking and talking about what’s happening in the health care encounter and the institutional climate. And then there’s the access to care issue. There are all these complex pieces to this puzzle that have to be considered.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What led you to look at the question of newborn mortality and physician concordance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hardeman:</strong> [There are] a lot of stories about how the provider relationship matters for care.… It’s important to people and it matters for patients’ satisfaction. But there hasn’t been empirical evidence [before our study] that’s really been able to link concordance to a particular health outcome.</p>



<p>I could speak from a personal level as a Black woman who has been pregnant, putting together the care team that I wanted for my pregnancy and birth. I wanted a doula who came from the same racial background as myself, and having someone who really understood my life experience was incredibly important. Generally, that’s felt and sort of understood anecdotally. But having the opportunity to really dig into the numbers and the data was compelling for me.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Why might having a Black physician benefit a Black newborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greenwood</strong><strong>:</strong> Black doctors may be more in tune with the specific experience that black newborns are facing, [such as] more challenging births as the result of increased socioeconomic pressures. Let’s figure out what practices are different and try to get them to everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Hardeman</strong><strong>:</strong> We also have our physician workforce being trained in a way that is not always fully attentive to the impact of racism, both in the lives of their patients that they’re serving or will eventually serve, but also the history of racism within our health care delivery system. Being able to delineate the ways that racism is embedded within the health care system and the harm that that’s done to communities, particularly in communities of color, has to be part of this exploration as well.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do the findings mean for physicians and the health care system?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greenwood:</strong> Some of the reaction has been that we’re attempting to demonize doctors. That’s absolutely not true…. Let’s look at this and figure out situations under which we can limit newborn mortality, specifically for a group that experiences it so much. The goal is to try to show situations where this is better and worse, so we can get in and figure out … what practices are effective and which aren’t.</p>



<p>The other thing that we’ve heard a fair amount, which is really disturbing, is that this means only Black doctors should treat Black babies. No, we’re not going to create a Jim Crow era of medicine…. There is huge heterogeneity in physician quality. If we ignore that and select exclusively on race, then it’s not an efficient way to try to find the right doctor for you.</p>



<p><strong>Hardeman:</strong> What it comes down to is that the clinical penalty for a Black newborn who’s treated by a Black physician is halved in comparison to the penalty that Black newborns experience when they are cared for a by a white physician. That’s not to say that we’re talking about good versus bad physicians, or racist and not racist physicians. It’s that we need to be thinking about and exploring what this means in a broader context of how we ensure equity in our society.</p>

<p><strong>PhD in Computational &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience</strong></p>
<p>An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force.</p>
<p>The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.</p>
<p>We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.</p>
<p>The 3-year full-time PhD studentship includes a stipend of £15,285 per annum in addition to covering tuition fees. Only EU and UK citizens are eligible to apply.
The start date of the PhD will be January 2021.</p>
<p>The PhD will be supervised by Dr Shabnam Kadir (University of Hertfordshire), Dr Elena Antonova (Brunel University London), Prof Robert Leech (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London), and Prof Chrystopher Nehaniv (University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/female-hyena-moms-kill-cubs-own-clans">Female hyenas kill off cubs in their own clans</a></h4>

<p>Female hyenas may be out for cubs’ blood — even within their own clans. New research suggests that infanticide may be part of a strategy females use to maintain their social standing.</p>



<p>“It’s not that these events are weird one-off things … this is actually a pretty significant source of mortality,” says Eli Strauss, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Strauss and his colleagues scoured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rebranding-hyena">three decades of data on spotted hyena populations</a> in Kenya to study deaths of cubs less than a year old <em>(SN: 4/23/02)</em>. Of 99 observed deaths, 21 could be attributed to infanticide, always by female killers. Starvation and lions also took many young cubs’ lives.</p>



<p>The infanticide observations made the team wonder why hyenas kill within their own group. It “seems sort of counterintuitive if animals benefit from living socially,” Strauss says. Though hyenas spend much of their time alone, group living allows them to defend their turf against rival hyena clans and to gang up against threatening lions, he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="female hyenas approacing a nursing mother hyena" class="wp-image-3090609" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082020_cw_hyena_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090609">In an act of mild aggression, two female hyenas approach a mother nursing her cubs. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090609">E. Strauss</span></figure>



<p>Hyena mothers give birth in an isolated den. But typically within a few weeks, they move their cubs to a communal den. Such dens shelter little ones from large predators that can’t enter the sanctuary’s small access holes, says Ally Brown, an environmental biology student at Michigan State University in East Lansing. But the communal den presents other risks — all the cases of infanticide occurred in its vicinity, documented by researchers who either found the dead cubs or observed the clans from cars that serve as mobile blinds <em>(SN: 4/23/02)</em>.</p>



<p>Female hyenas <a href="https://eco.confex.com/eco/2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/83719">kill cubs in the same way that they attack small prey</a>. A hyena “would just go up to a cub and grab it by the skull and crush it,” says Brown, who presented the work in a poster at the Ecological Society of America’s 2020 meeting held virtually the week of August 3. And close kin weren’t necessarily immune — one female targeted her sister’s two cubs, coaxing them out of the den before killing both. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a hyena carrying a cub with a crushed skull" class="wp-image-3090610" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082020_cw_hyena_inline2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090610">Female hyenas kill cubs by crushing their skulls — the same way that adult hyenas kill small prey.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090610">Kate Yoshida</span></figure>



<p>A hint at what spurs such slayings lies in the hyenas’ ranks. In hyena societies, males may come and go while females <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-some-male-hyenas-leave-and-others-are-content-stay-home">stick around as permanent members</a> (<em>SN: 3/28/16</em>). Aggressive interactions and alliances help determine which hyenas are on top, and all individuals know where they stand, Strauss says.</p>



<p>Female cubs that reach adulthood can grow a maternal line, which helps boost that family group’s rank. In nearly all cases studied, killers ranked higher than the victim’s mother. That suggests that some females may use infanticide to keep their rivals’ bloodlines down.</p>





<p>In 11 out of 21 infanticides, dead cubs were eaten. Since timings of cub killings didn’t correlate with prey availability and since hungry males weren’t killing cubs, the researchers concluded that consuming the dead cubs wasn’t the main motivation for the attacks. Strauss, Brown and Michigan State behavioral ecologist Kay Holekamp also shared <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.074237v1">their results</a> May 2 in a preprint posted at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>“Infanticide is a very difficult to observe phenomenon,” says Elise Huchard, a behavioral ecologist at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the University of Montpellier in France who was not involved with the work. The number of cases with known cause of death and quality of the observations contribute to the strength of the study, Huchard says.</p>



<p>More is known about why males kill young, Huchard says. In other species, such as lions, for instance, males may kill young animals so that that the mothers will become sexually receptive sooner. Similar behavior has been observed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/eyewitness-account-dolphin-birth-takes-dark-turn">in dolphins</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/15</em>). This study now also shows that in some species, females compete to pass on their genes, but through offspring survival instead of by vying for opportunities to mate. With high competition for reproduction, “males and females will do anything to promote their own offspring, including killing the offspring of others,” Huchard says.</p>



<p>Despite their treatment of others’ cubs, female hyenas can be “very attentive and diligent mothers,” Strauss says. Hyena moms nurse their cubs for around 14 months and help them get enough food even after they’re weaned. And mothers seem to recognize their loss when a cub is killed, Strauss says, sometimes making distressed sounds or grooming the dead cub.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong">A man in Hong Kong is the first confirmed case of coronavirus reinfection</a></h4>

<p>A 33-year-old man in Hong Kong was infected with the coronavirus a second time, more than four months after his initial infection, researchers report. His case is the first confirmed account of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.</p>



<p>The fact that some people can be reinfected with the virus is “not a huge shock,” says Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City and with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. People often get reinfected with the coronaviruses that cause the common cold. And some people may not mount a strong enough immune response to fight off SARS-CoV-2 a second time.</p>



<p>“The key unknowns at the moment are how often this occurs and to what extent,” Bieniasz says.</p>



<p>If reinfections are relatively common, it could make reaching <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">herd immunity</a> — the proportion of the population that has to be immune to protect other people — through natural infections more difficult (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>). Vaccines, however, might trigger a more robust immune response and help protect populations by providing herd immunity.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s unknown how long immunity to the coronavirus lasts. Some people can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-reinfection-immune-response">test positive</a> for the virus’s genetic material for months after their recovery, but do not shed infectious virus (<em>SN: 5/19/20</em>). A few studies measuring antibodies — key immune proteins that recognize and bind to pathogens — suggest that antibody levels do wane over time. Other preliminary work hints that antibodies that can <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151126v1">stop the virus</a> from entering cells remain in the blood for at least three months.</p>



<p>Previous anecdotal reports of patients who had recovered from an infection only to be sickened again with COVID-19 months later have surfaced during the pandemic. But without genetic evidence that each round of illness was caused by two distinct viruses, it was unclear whether such cases were true reinfections.</p>



<p>Genetic data confirmed on August 24 that the man was in fact reinfected, 142 days after his first illness, the researchers reported August 24. A study describing the findings has been accepted for publication in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>, but is not yet available online.</p>



<p>The first time the man was infected, he had a fever, cough, sore throat and headache for three days. He tested positive for the coronavirus on March 26 and was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong three days later. At that point his symptoms had gone away. He was discharged on April 14 after he tested negative for the virus twice. But the man tested positive again more than four months later on August 15, when officials screened him upon returning to the Hong Kong airport from Spain. The second time, he never showed any indication of being sick — a sign that his immune system kicked in enough to protect him from the disease because he remained asymptomatic but not enough to prevent reinfection.</p>



<p>In the new study, Kwok-Yung Yuen, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues analyzed most of the genetic blueprint, composed of RNA, of each of the patient’s coronavirus infections and looked for differences. Viruses from each bout of COVID-19 differed by 24 nucleotides, the building blocks that make up the virus’s RNA. Those differences indicate that the man was infected two different times by two versions of SARS-CoV-2: one that is closely related to variants circulating in the United States and England in March and April, and another related to viruses from Switzerland and England in July and August.</p>



<p>Ten days after the patient developed symptoms the first time, he tested negative for antibodies against the virus. But it may have been too early for researchers to detect the immune proteins. The second time around, he also didn’t have antibodies in his first three days in the hospital. He tested positive for the immune proteins on the fifth day, a sign his immune system had rapidly mobilized to fight the virus.</p>

<p>Although the study reveals that reinfection is possible, it also suggests that the immune system is doing its job to fight off infections, researchers say. And “people shouldn’t think that everybody’s going to be susceptible to infection [again] within four months,” Bieniasz says. Because the man originally tested negative for antibodies during his first infection and researchers did not monitor levels over time, “we don’t really know what the magnitude of the immune response was in this person.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear how often reinfections with the new coronavirus happen globally, especially if the second round of infection results in milder symptoms. “When we say that people don’t typically get reinfected, that’s based on the epidemiology of when people get sick again,” says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. “This might happen more often than we think, but no one’s swabbing people on a routine basis when they’re healthy.”</p>



<p>It’s also unknown whether the man could transmit the virus to others. “That’s an important question,” says Kartik Chandran, a virologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Some people might still develop some sort of infection a second time, he says, and if they mount a strong immune response, they may not get seriously ill, but they may still shed the virus and infect other people. But it’s also possible that the immune response to a new infection could lower the amount infectious virus a person is capable of transmitting to someone else.</p>



<p>For now, researchers need to evaluate more cases, experts say, to see if this man’s case was more the norm or an exception. “If you infect 5 million people with anything, there’s going to be one or two people that are way different than the rest,” Slifka says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s a commonly held notion that young people are more hopeful about the future than any other group — you might have heard this referred to, either positively or negatively, as “youthful optimism”. Even Jane Austen picked up on it: “There is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions”, she wrote in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</p>



<p>But is this actually the case? According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300738">new study</a> from William J. Chopik and colleagues published in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, optimism actually continues growing well past youth — and it’s only later in life that it begins to decline.</p>


<p><span id="more-40105"></span></p>


<p>The team was interested in how optimism changes with age — and how life events might affect that trajectory. They gathered data from three longitudinal studies of people aged between 16 and 101: one from the Netherlands (10,045 participants), one from Germany (42,691 participants) and one from the United States (22,150 participants).</p>



<p>In the Dutch and American studies optimism was tracked using a six-item measure, with participants rating how much they agreed with statements including “I expect more good things to happen” or “I rarely count on good things”. In Germany, participants rated how optimistic or pessimistic they were about the future on a scale from 1 to 4.</p>



<p>The team also looked at sixteen life events concerning children (e.g. childbirth, or a child leaving home), relationships (e.g. getting married or divorcing,), parents (loss of a parent), moving house, health, and employment (e.g. getting a job for the first time or retiring). The team then measured variance in the optimism measure from 2006 to 2016, mapping it against these life events.</p>



<p>Results suggested that “youthful optimism” isn’t quite as accurate a concept as we might assume: in fact, younger adults were <em>lower</em> in optimism than middle aged people. This hopefulness then plateaued until later life, when optimism started to decline again. This also held for pessimism, which was highest among older adults and sharply decreased as young adults reached middle age.</p>



<p>It might not fit our assumptions about optimism, but it does make sense that optimism increases into middle age. As we get older we have more and more experience of success, whether that’s in our careers or our personal lives. We’re more likely to know what we want out of life and may also feel in control of the future – hence feeling more optimistic.</p>



<p>This pattern was different in the German sample, however, where younger adults were <em>more</em> optimistic than their middle aged counterparts: the team suggests this may be down to social and cultural changes between generations specific to Germany.     </p>



<p>Predictably, optimism was sometimes related to positive events and pessimism to negative events — if you’ve experienced chronic illness, unemployment or bereavement it makes sense you’d have less hope for the future. However, results weren’t consistent between samples and were not all so straightforward: for instance, negative changes in health were associated with <em>higher</em> levels of optimism in some cases.</p>



<p>These inconsistent results could be because life events were simply categorised as either “occurred” or “did not occur”, which may not pick up on the nuances of how people actually experience things. A break-up, for example, might be a <em>positive</em> life event for somebody in a miserable relationship; similarly, leaving the parental home may be more or less emotionally significant depending on person and context. Future research could look at categorising life events more thoroughly.</p>



<p>Limitations aside, the results do suggest that human beings tend to be fairly optimistic for most of their lives. As Chopik <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/study-shows-humans-are-optimists-for-most-of-life/">says</a>, this resilience is a cheering thought. “We often think that the really sad or tragic things that happen in life completely alter us as people,” he said. “But people diagnosed with an illness or who go through another crisis still felt positive about the future and what life had ahead for them on the other side.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/positronium-energy-levels-exotic-atom-physics">A measurement of positronium’s energy levels confounds scientists</a></h4>

<p>Positronium is positively puzzling.</p>



<p>A new measurement of the exotic “atom” — consisting of an electron and its antiparticle, a positron — <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.073002">disagrees with theoretical calculations</a>, scientists report in the Aug. 14 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. And physicists are at a loss to explain it.</p>



<p>A flaw in either the calculations or the experiment seems unlikely, researchers say. And new phenomena, such as undiscovered particles, also don’t provide an easy answer, adds theoretical physicist Jesús Pérez Ríos of the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin. “Right now, the best I can tell you is, we don’t know,” says Pérez Ríos, who was not involved with the new research.</p>



<p>Positronium is composed of an electron, with a negative charge, circling in orbit with a positron, with a positive charge — making what’s effectively <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alliance-opposites-electrons-and-positrons-make-new-molecule">an atom without a nucleus</a> (<em>SN: 9/12/07</em>). With just two particles and free from the complexities of a nucleus, positronium is appealingly simple. Its simplicity means it can be used to precisely test the theory of quantum electrodynamics, which explains how electrically charged particles interact.</p>





<p>A team of physicists from University College London measured the separation between two specific energy levels of positronium, what’s known as its fine structure. The researchers formed positronium by colliding a beam of positrons with a target, where they met up with electrons. After manipulating the positronium atoms with a laser to put them in the appropriate energy level, the team hit them with microwave radiation to induce some of them to jump to another energy level.</p>



<p>The researchers pinpointed the frequency of radiation needed to make the atoms take the leap, which is equivalent to finding the size of the gap between the energy levels. While the frequency predicted from calculations was about 18,498 megahertz, the researchers measured about 18,501 megahertz, a difference of about 0.02 percent. Given that the estimated experimental error was only about 0.003 percent, that’s a wide gap.</p>



<p>The team searched for experimental issues that could explain the result, but came up empty. Additional experiments are now needed to help investigate the mismatch, says physicist Akira Ishida of the University of Tokyo, who was not involved with the study. “If there is still significant discrepancy after further precise measurements, the situation becomes much more exciting.”</p>



<p>The theoretical prediction also seems solid. In quantum electrodynamics, making predictions involves calculating to a certain level of precision, leaving out terms that are less significant and more difficult to calculate. Those additional terms are expected to be too small to account for the discrepancy. But, “it’s conceivable that you could be surprised,” says theoretical physicist Greg Adkins of Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., also not involved with the research.</p>



<p>If the experiments and the theoretical calculations check out, the discrepancy might be due to a new particle, but that explanation also seems unlikely. A new particle’s effects probably would have shown up in earlier experiments. For example, says Pérez Ríos, positronium’s energy levels could be affected by a hypothetical axion-like particle. That’s a lightweight particle that has the potential to explain dark matter, an invisible type of matter thought to permeate the universe. But if that type of particle was causing this mismatch, researchers would also have seen its effects in measurements of the magnetic properties of the electron and its heavier cousin, the muon.</p>



<p>That leaves scientists still searching for an answer, says physicist David Cassidy, a coauthor of the study. “It’s going to be something surprising. I just don’t know what.­”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">New treatments aim to treat COVID-19 early, before it gets serious</a></h4>

<p>The sooner, the better is an adage that’s especially true when treating viral infections.</p>



<p>Usually, drugs that tamp down a virus are given within the first couple of days of symptoms. But with the coronavirus, the only two drugs known to help — an antiviral called remdesivir, and steroids such as dexamethasone — are given only to people hospitalized with the disease.</p>



<p>Those drugs may keep seriously ill people from dying and help them recover faster, but it would be far better to keep people from getting so sick in the first place, scientists say. To that end, they’re testing a number of drugs that could be taken as soon as someone tests positive.</p>



<p>Of course, scientists are also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety">frantically working</a> to get vaccines ready for the general public (<em>SN: 7/10/20</em>). Many have passed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response">initial safety testing</a> and entered the final phase of clinical trials to probe how well they protect against the virus (<em>SN: 7/21/20</em>). A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-russia-vaccine-testing">Russian-made vaccine</a> may roll out to the public there even before scientists know whether it works (<em>SN: 8/11/20</em>).</p>





<p>But even with the pedal-to-the-metal speed at which vaccine developers are working, it still may take months to years for vaccines to be readily available to everyone. “We can’t count on that, so we need another tool in our toolkit,” says Lisa Danzig, a vaccine developer and the medical advisor for the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The fund was established by businessman and philanthropist Steve Kirsch to pay for outpatient clinical trials, with the goal of reducing hospitalization and death by 75 percent.</p>

<p>Researchers have identified and are testing a variety of existing drugs that might be repurposed to fight the coronavirus early in infections. None have been proven yet, and much of the federal and private funding for clinical trials has gone for treating the severely ill. So Kirsch’s fund has stepped in to fill that gap, for instance paying for a trial of hydroxychloroquine as a possible preventative for people who had been exposed to the coronavirus. That study found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-hydroxychloroquine-prevention-exposure">no benefit</a> to taking the drug (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>Even such negative results are important, Danzig says. “The important thing is to get the data, so we can say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and we can get together and prioritize resources.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the potential early treatments for COVID-19 considered among the most promising, and how they work.</p>



<h4>No entry</h4>



<p>One way to stop the coronavirus is by denying it entry in the first place. To slip into human cells, the virus needs to essentially pick a particular lock. There are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">two ways it could do that</a>, but recent studies with human lung cells suggest the coronavirus prefers one of the two routes (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>). That route relies on a protein-cutting enzyme called TMPRSS2 to snip the knobby-looking spike protein studding the virus’s surface. That cut allows the virus to fuse with the cell membrane and dump its genetic material into the cell. Once inside, the virus can multiply.</p>



<p>In lab studies, that process can be blocked with a drug called camostat mesylate, which stops the TMPRSS2 enzyme from snipping the spike protein.</p>



<p>“It’s a drug that has been used for decades,” says Stefan Pöhlmann, a virologist at the German Primate Center in Göttingen. The drug is <a href="https://www.rad-ar.or.jp/siori/english/kekka.cgi?n=34183">used in Japan</a> for treating pancreatitis, and studies indicate it is generally safe. Pöhlmann and colleagues reported preliminary data August 5 at bioRxiv.org suggesting that the drug, and a chemical it breaks down to, have <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.237651v1">antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2</a> and are likely to work at doses commonly given to patients. “It’s worthwhile trying in clinical trials,” he says.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>The drug may have its best shot of stopping coronavirus at the border if it’s given as early as possible in the infection. One outpatient clinical trial is already under way in <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04321096">Denmark</a>. Another trial is set to start soon at <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04353284">Yale School of Medicine</a> to treat people newly infected with the virus. The Danish study is also testing the drug in hospitalized patients.    </p>



<h4>Replication wreckers</h4>



<p>Once the virus has made its way into cells, it starts making copies of itself. Several drugs, including remdesivir, interfere with that process. Though remdesivir is given intravenously to hospitalized people with COVID-19, its maker Gilead Sciences Inc. has developed an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remdesivir-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-gilead">inhaled form</a> that might be used at home in newly diagnosed people (<em>SN: 7/13/20</em>), and perhaps as a preventative treatment.</p>



<p>Still, remdesivir is complicated to make and supplies are limited, so researchers are testing other drugs that might also throw wrenches into the coronavirus’s replication machinery.</p>



<p>One such drug is favipiravir. Originally developed as an anti-influenza drug and stockpiled in Japan for use in a flu pandemic, favipiravir has already been authorized for emergency use in Russia, India and China for treating COVID-19. Like remdesivir, favipiravir works by mimicking a building block of the virus’s genetic material, RNA. When the look-alike is incorporated into a growing strand of RNA, it stops production of the genetic molecule and keeps the virus from replicating.</p>



<p>Favipiravir has at least one advantage over remdesivir. “It’s in a pill form, and it’s not a very big pill,” says Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Stanford School of Medicine who is leading a trial of favipiravir there. The study will test the drug against a placebo in an outpatient setting.</p>



<p>Already favipiravir has been studied in the United States for treating influenza and it didn’t work better than the current drug for that illness, oseltamavir (Tamiflu). But those tests in more than 3,000 people showed that the drug has few side effects. Maldonado and colleagues will enroll patients within 72 hours of getting a positive COVID-19 test. Participants will take the pills twice a day for 10 days, and nasal swabs will be used to determine whether the drug is reducing the amount of virus the person is producing, which may stop transmission to others.</p>



<p>“We’re excited because we need drugs that inhibit the virus directly,” Maldonado says.</p>



<p>Another experimental drug called EIDD-2801 also mimics an RNA building block and can be taken in pill form. The drug’s Miami-based maker, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, has teamed up with global pharmaceutical company Merck to test the drug. Initial safety tests are complete and the drug is now in Phase II trials for safety, dosage and efficacy against the coronavirus, including an <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04405570">outpatient study</a> in North Carolina.</p>



<p>An experimental compound also made by Gilead and being tested against <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-two-drugs-cats-humans-treatment">coronavirus in cats</a> might also hold promise against COVID-19 in people (<em>SN: 8/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>Results of these early tests may be known soon. If any of them pan out, larger clinical trials would be needed to establish efficacy. And if they don’t, there are many other drugs in the works.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img alt="cover of July 4, 2020 &amp; July 18, 2020 issue" class="wp-image-3089545" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_mars_cover_hi-144x186.jpg" /></figure></div>



<h4>Mars dust up</h4>



<p><em>Predicting dust storms on Mars will help keep rovers and future astronauts safe on the planet’s surface, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">How upcoming missions to Mars will help predict its wild dust storms</a>” (</em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 24<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story reported that scientists struggle to understand how dust gets lifted into the air. “Have they considered static electricity? A static charge on the dust particles would create repulsion between separate particles and between particles and the ground, levitating them enough to be moved by the winds,” reader <strong>Bruce M­erchant </strong>wrote.</p>





<p>Yes, electric fields formed by colliding dust grains can help increase the amount of dust in the atmosphere. Though electric forces alone are not enough to explain dust lift on Mars, the forces “are critical in the dust-­lifting process and should be taken into account,” says <strong>Germán Martínez </strong>of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. Electric forces also loft dust into Earth’s atmosphere, <strong>Grossman </strong>notes. Studies in the Moroccan desert have suggested that electric fields can increase the amount of dust injected into the atmosphere by a factor of 10.</p>



<p><strong>Merchant </strong>thought static electricity could have contributed to the demise of NASA’s P­hoenix Mars Lander and Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. “Do any current or planned missions to Mars include sensors that could detect and measure static electrical activity?” he asked.</p>



<p>Electric fields associated with dust lifting could affect the performance and lifetime of hardware on Mars, <strong>Grossman</strong> says, “although I don’t think it was the critical factor for P­hoenix or Opportunity.” No past mission has measured electric fields, nor will any of the three missions launched in 2020. The European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli lander was supposed to take such measurements, but the lander crashed into the Red Planet in 2016. The ExoMars mission lander slated to launch in 2022 will measure electric fields. “That’ll be a precious piece of information,” <strong>Martínez</strong> says.</p>



<h4>Red Planet preppers</h4>



<p><em>Future Mars explorers will need protections from microgravity and radiation, <strong>Maria Temming </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">What will astronauts need to survive the dangerous journey to Mars?</a>” (</em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20 p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Henry Jones </strong>wondered if a protective magnetic field could be created to surround a Mars-bound spaceship.</p>



<p>NASA is investigating whether it’s possible to build a device that would generate a magnetic field to repel radiation, as Earth’s magnetic field does. The idea “is in its infancy,” says <strong>J­ennifer Fogarty</strong>, chief scientist of NASA’s Human Research Program at Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We’re all rooting for it.… It would be amazing for something like that to arrive. I can’t depend on it, though.”</p>



<h4>Gassy with a chance of bubbles</h4>



<p><em>Scientists spotted visible light emanating from gas blobs, called Fermi bubbles, that sandwich the plane of the Milky Way g­alaxy, <strong>Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-giant-gas-fermi-bubbles-seen-visible-light-first-time">The Milky Way’s giant gas bubbles were seen in visible light for the first time</a>” (</em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 5<em>).</em></p>



<p>“Has there been a survey of Fermi bubbles around other galaxies?” reader <strong>Eric Anderson</strong> asked.</p>



<p>Yes, researchers have looked for Fermi bubbles around nearby galaxies, <strong>Conover </strong>says, but the bubbles are not easy to spot. “There is some evidence for bubbles around the neighboring Andromeda galaxy, about 2.5 million light-years away,” she says.</p>



<h4>What’s in a name?</h4>



<p><em>Astronomers identified two unusual bursts of light, one known as CSS161010 and the other nicknamed the Koala, <strong>Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weird-cosmic-flare-called-cow-now-has-company-koala">A weird cosmic flare called the ‘Cow’ now has company”</a> (</em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>“A ‘cute’ nickname for CSS161010 would be Tenten, for the obvious reason, but also because (thanks to a Google search) it is the name of a female character in [the] Japanese manga series … <em>Naruto</em>,” reader <strong>Oliver Del Signore</strong> wrote. “If Tenten or some other nickname is eventually assigned, I hope <em>Science News</em> will include a short update in a future issue.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-science-does-not-yet-have-answers">When science doesn’t yet have the answers</a></h4>

<p>Back-to-school time is usually greeted with delight by children and parents. This year, school has become a hellscape of uncertainty due to the United States’ failure to subdue the coronavirus. We all want children to be back at school, learning and playing with their peers. How to get them there with at least a modicum of safety is the latest challenge in a year of extraordinary challenges.</p>



<p>On the face of it, making schools safe enough in a pandemic seems like a straightforward public health question. But though scientists have learned a great deal in the last seven months about how the coronavirus is transmitted and how to reduce risk, there’s still so much we don’t know, especially when it comes to kids. And as with too many other issues involving this pandemic, misinformation is rampant.</p>



<p>To find out what the science really says about children and COVID-19, five of our reporters set to work evaluating current research and interviewing a wide range of scientists across disciplines. Our reporters then distilled that information into a concise report addressing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks">key questions about COVID-19, children and schools</a>. </p>



<p>What we found out is that because the science is still uncertain on how the coronavirus affects children and how readily they infect others, there’s no clear path to keeping kids safe, or even reducing risk. Though children appear less likely to become seriously ill or die than adults, youngsters do get infected. They also can transmit the virus to others, including educators, school staff and family members who are at higher risk of serious illness merely by being adults. Countries that have successfully reopened schools have done so first by achieving much lower rates of community spread than in the United States. Then those schools paid strict attention to social distancing, wearing masks and hygiene, including handwashing and frequent cleaning of classrooms.</p>



<p>So education this fall, from pre-K all the way up through college, will be a “massive collection of experiments,” our reporters write, whether the students are in classrooms or online. Many of us at <em>Science News</em>, including me, find our own families in the midst of that experiment. We’re right there with the many millions of families struggling to figure out how to keep family members as safe as possible while getting children the education they need.</p>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. Solutions will emerge, though not as quickly as we need them. New data will provide more clarity; lessons can be learned from the countries that are successfully managing school during a global pandemic. Many of those lessons will be painful reminders of how we have failed America’s children. But we are learning through experience.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-mosquitoes-florida-test-release">Genetically modified mosquitoes have been OK’d for a first U.S. test flight</a></h4>

<p>After a decade of fits and starts, officials in the Florida Keys have voted to allow the first test in the United States of free-flying, genetically modified mosquitoes as a way to fight the pests and the diseases they spread.</p>



<p>The decision came after about <a href="https://keysmosquito.org/board-meetings/">two hours of contentious testimony</a> in a virtual public hearing on August 18. Many speakers railed against uncertainties in releasing genetically engineered organisms. In the end, though, worries about mosquito-borne diseases proved more compelling. On the day of the vote, dengue fever cases in Monroe County, where the Keys are located, totaled 47 so far in 2020, the first surge in almost a decade.</p>



<p>The same mosquitoes known for yellow fever (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) also spread dengue as well as Zika and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chikungunya-move">Chikungunya</a> (<em>SN: 6/2/15</em>). The species is especially hard to control among about 45 kinds of mosquitoes that whine around the Keys. Even the powerhouse Florida Keys Mosquito Control District with six aircraft for spraying — Miami has zero — kills only an estimated 30 to 50 percent of the local yellow fever mosquito population with its best pesticide treatments, says district board chairman Phil Goodman.</p>



<p>“We can’t rely on chemistry to spray our way out of this,” Goodman, a chemist himself, said as the commissioners conferred after the public’s comments. Then 4–1, the commissioners voted to go forward with a test of genetically modified males as pest control devices.</p>





<p>Sometime after January 1, 2021, Florida workers will set out boxes of eggs of specially bred male yellow fever mosquitoes (a recent version called OX5034) in a stretch of Monroe County still to be chosen. The eggs, shipped from the biotech company <a href="https://www.oxitec.com/en/our-technology">Oxitec</a> based in Abingdon, England, will grow into normal-looking males. Like other male mosquitoes, they drink flower nectar, not blood.</p>



<p>Then planners hope that during tests, these Oxitec foreigners will charm female mosquitoes into mating. A bit of saboteur genetics from the males will kill any female offspring resulting from the mating, and over time that should shrink the swarms. Sons that inherit their dad’s no-daughter genes will go on to shrink the next generation even further.</p>



<p>By now, Oxitec has supplied some billion saboteur male mosquitoes for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gm-mosquitoes-succeed-reducing-dengue-company-says">release elsewhere around the world, especially in Brazil</a>, where Zika can flare up and dengue is common (<em>SN: 7/15/16</em>). The notion of releasing sterile males of a pest to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquitoes-remade">romance the population down to some scattered lonely hearts</a> is at least 80 years old (<em>SN: 6/29/12</em>). For decades, that meant sterilizing males by exposing them to radiation and then releasing them into the wild. But mosquitoes were too delicate for the radiation techniques of the time. When scientists figured out an efficient way to tweak a fruit fly’s natural DNA, reported in 1982, hopes rose for genetically sterilizing male pest insects.</p>



<p>In Oxitec’s method, some of the mosquito genes of the breeding stock not involved in the daughter-killing mechanism can spread a bit into any wild populations of the species, at least for a while. Yet researchers have argued that <em>Ae. aegypti </em>mosquitoes probably hitchhiked on ships into the Americas, so preserving their wild genetics in the United States would just mean coddling an invasive species. Also, introducing some gene that would make the U.S. wildlings more of a nuisance than they already are seems unlikely, says public health entomologist Kevin Gorman from Oxitec.</p>



<p>In spite of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florida-theyre-fighting-mosquitoes-meddling-their-sex-lives">years of drama</a> over the Keys’ consideration of releasing GM mosquitoes (<em>SN: 5/8/17</em>), Florida’s batch will not be the first GM insects to fly free in the United States. (And if it weren’t for COVID-19, they might not be the only mosquito pioneers; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-approves-experimental-use-permit-test-innovative-biopesticide-tool-better-protect">simultaneously approved an experimental release in Houston’s Harris County</a>, now on hold during the pandemic.) The first GM insects released in the United States, also from Oxitec, were early versions of pink bollworm moths for an eradication program to wipe out this cotton pest in the U.S Southwest. That genetic tweak merely supplied a marker that would identify irradiated insects but didn’t change any fertility genes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="prototype capsule of GM male mosquitoes" class="wp-image-3090642" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/061720_sm_mosquito_inline_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090642">One prototype capsule can hold thousands of Oxitec’s genetically modified male mosquitoes. The company ships capsules from the United Kingdom to places like Brazil and, soon, Florida.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090642">Oxitec</span></figure>



<p>The first GM insects with fertility tweaks (Oxitec again) were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gm-moth-trial-gets-green-light-usda">diamondback moths</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/17</em>). “We would love to have been the second,” says entomologist Tony Shelton of Cornell University. Instead the first-of-its kind project sparked 673 individual comments, 78 percent of them not happy, when regulators posted the application to release the moths in 2017 in a New York field.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274">new application to test GM mosquitoes in Florida</a>, however, got 5,656 comments, plus a petition against the project that drew more than 25,000 signatures. Even though people probably detest mosquitoes more than moth larvae that can damage broccoli, the fact that the Florida Keys project involves genetic modification still stirs passion.</p>



<p>As far as specific concerns go, one common one involves antibiotics, says Oxitec’s Gorman. To keep females in the breeding stock alive, the company adds the antibiotic tetracycline to the water where the larvae dangle rump-up before transitioning to aerial adulthood. That suppresses the killing mechanism, which involves a protein that’s blocked by tetracycline. When people put eggs in the wild, there’s no antibiotic, so daughters die. The egg parents’ history with antibiotics has raised concerns that egg releases might encourage the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>



<p>Gorman contends that that’s not likely. The EPA has required testing sites at least 500 meters away from sewage plants (where antibiotics show up in waste and in theory might keep some daughters alive) and citrus orchards (which can get treated with antibiotics for their own diseases). Also, the latest version of these mosquitoes is shipped from the United Kingdom as cleaned male eggs. Their moms laid the eggs as adults living in air instead of in the youngsters’ tetracycline-tinged soup.</p>



<p>Some of the more general objections to the project may have more to do with suspicions of government and for-profit businesses than with mosquito biology. Some unease, too, may come just from basic human reactions to risk and control, says public health entomologist Natasha Agramonte, who has no connection with Oxitec but has been working with mosquitoes at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Car crashes injure several million Americans a year, but driving lets people feel they’re in control. Watching abundant mosquitoes being released, though? Not so much.   </p>

<p>The sun’s wispy upper atmosphere, called the corona, is an ever-changing jungle of sizzling plasma. But mapping the strength of the magnetic fields that largely control that behavior has proved elusive. The fields are weak and the brightness of the sun outshines its corona.</p>



<p>Now though, observations taken using a specialized instrument called a coronagraph to block out the sun’s bright disk have allowed solar physicists to measure the speed and intensity of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hotter-sun">waves rippling through coronal plasma</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/09</em>). “This is the first time we’ve mapped the coronal magnetic field on a large scale,” says Steven Tomczyk, a solar physicist at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colo., who designed the coronagraph.</p>



<p>In 2017, Tomczyk had been part of a team that took advantage of a total solar eclipse crisscrossing North America to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-solar-magnetic-field">take measurements of the corona’s magnetic field</a> (<em>SN: 8/16/17</em>). He trekked to a mountaintop in Wyoming with a special camera to snap polarized pictures of the corona just as the moon blocked the sun.  (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wyoming-eclipse-physics-corona">I was there with them</a>, reporting on the team’s efforts to help explain why the corona is so much hotter than the sun’s surface (<em>SN: 8/21/17</em>).) The team observed a tiny slice of the corona to test whether a particular wavelength of light could carry signatures of the corona’s magnetic field. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-things-learned-great-american-eclipse">It can</a> (<em>SN: 8/21/18</em>).</p>



<p>But it’s the observations from the coronagraph, made in 2016, that allowed researchers to look at the whole corona all at once. Theorists had shown decades ago that coronal waves’ velocities can be used to infer the strength of the magnetic field. Such waves might also help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">carry heat from the sun’s surface into the corona</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>). But no one had measured them across the whole corona before.</p>





<p>The corona’s magnetic field <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/694">strength is mostly between 1 and 4 gauss</a>, a few times the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field at the planet’s surface, the researchers report in the Aug. 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Making a map is a big step, the team says. But what solar physicists would really like to do is track the corona’s magnetic field continuously, at least once a day.</p>



<p>“The solar magnetic field is evolving all the time,” says solar physicist Zihao Yang of Peking University in Beijing. Sometimes the sun releases magnetic energy explosively, sending <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronal-mass-ejection-magnetic-sun-plasma-eruption">bursts of plasma can shooting out into space</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/19</em>). Those ejections can wreak havoc on satellites or power grids when they strike Earth. Continuously monitoring coronal magnetism can help predict those outbursts. “Our work demonstrated that we can use this technique to map the global distribution of coronal magnetic field, but we only showed one map from a single dataset,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Measuring the strength of the corona’s magnetic field is “a really big deal,” says solar physicist Jenna Samra of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. “Making global maps of the coronal magnetic field strength … is what’s going to allow us to eventually get better predictions of space weather events,” she says. “This is a really nice step in that direction.”</p>



<p>Tomczyk and colleagues are working on an upgraded version of the coronagraph, called COSMO, for <a href="https://www2.hao.ucar.edu/cosmo">Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory</a>, that would use the same technique repeatedly with the ultimate goal of predicting the sun’s behavior.</p>



<p>“It’s a milestone to do it,” Tomczyk says. “The goal is to do it regularly, do it all the time.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/board-game-endangered-conservation">The board game Endangered shows just how hard conservation can be</a></h4>

<p>Saving endangered species isn’t easy. Doing so requires the cooperation of many people — from scientists and conservation organizations to governments and local residents — as well as a bit of luck. That’s as true in real life as it is in <a href="https://grandgamersguild.com/shop/endangered/">Endangered</a>, a new board game from Grand Gamers Guild.</p>



<p>Endangered is a cooperative game for one to five players. Each person takes on a role — zoologist, philanthropist, lobbyist, environmental lawyer or TV wildlife show host — and players work together to convince at least four ambassadors to save a species. (In a one-player game, two roles are played simultaneously.) If you get too few “yes” votes, or let habitat destruction spread too much, or if your animal population dies out, everyone loses.</p>



<p>The game starts with a set of animals in their habitat, either tigers or sea otters, depending on which of the game’s two story lines you play. Each player’s turn consists of a series of phases. In the first, a player takes actions, such as moving animals to let them mate or obtaining money.</p>



<p>In the offspring phase, animal reproduction is controlled by the role of a die. The die also controls where habitation destruction — either deforestation or pollution — spreads. A card draw then brings on other events, from clear-cutting of forests to a shark attack to an animal rescue.</p>





<p>After each player takes a turn, the year ends. And after a set number of years, the ambassadors are consulted. Each ambassador has a different preset list of conditions that must be met to vote “yes.”</p>



<p>The game is modular, and each story line has its own challenges and adorable, animal-shaped wooden meeples. (A third story line, <a href="https://store.grandgamersguild.com/products/the-great-panda-for-endangered">giant pandas</a>, is available in an expansion pack, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endangerednewspecies/endangered-new-species?ref=68tycu">Kickstarter</a> that began this month is raising funds for additional animal packs.) Each story line has three levels of difficulty, which, combined with the multiple role-playing options, provide plenty of variety throughout multiple plays of the game.</p>



<p>But while the game is fairly simple to set up and learn, winning proved deceptively difficult. Just when I thought I’d get enough ambassadors on my side, I found myself losing all my tigers or awash in pollution.</p>



<p>The game’s scenarios, while simplified, recognize real-world problems for these animals. Poachers and habitat fragmentation indeed threaten tigers, just as oil spills and <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>parasites endanger sea otters. “I wanted a theme that players can relate to, something engaging and emotional,” says Joe Hopkins, the game’s designer. Endangered’s publisher, Marc Specter, notes that the game’s developers consulted with the Center for Biological Diversity to ensure scientific accuracy. And Specter says he plans on donating some of the profits from Endangered to the nonprofit organization.</p>



<p>If there is any downside to the game, it’s that Endangered can never hope to encompass the truly vast scope of the extinction problem. A study published in the June 16 <em>Proceedings of</em> <em>the National Academy of Sciences</em>, for example, estimates that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/24/13596">515 land-dwelling vertebrate species</a> alone are on the brink of extinction. And scientists have warned that the planet is in the midst of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racing-extinction-documents-plight-endangered-species">sixth mass extinction</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/15</em>).</p>



<p>But Endangered does hold an important lesson for how to move forward. Saving species is not something that scientists or philanthropists or lawyers or any other single group can do on its own. Only by working together do we have any chance of success.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">X-rays reveal what ancient animal mummies keep under wraps</a></h4>

<p>Egyptian animal mummies can look like little more than bundles of cloth. Now high-tech X-rays have unveiled the mysterious life histories of three of these mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake.</p>



<p>While 2-D X-rays of each specimen existed, little information existed beyond generic animal labels. So Richard Johnston, an engineer at Swansea University in Wales, and his colleagues used a microCT scanner to see what lies beneath the wraps of animal mummies at the university’s Museum of Egyptian Antiquities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img alt="digital image of a scan of a cat's head" class="wp-image-3090594" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081920_ht_animal-mummies_inline_680-453x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3090594">The mummified cat’s head (seen in this 3-D model created from microCT data) was separated from the body after death. The skull may also have been dropped at some point, creating more fractures postmortem.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3090594">Swansea University</span></figure></div>



<p>The bone scans of three of those specimens provided <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69726-0">such detail that researchers could identify</a> the cat as a domestic kitten (<em>Felis catus</em>), the bird as a Eurasian kestrel (<em>Falco tinnunculus</em>) and the snake as an Egyptian cobra (<em>Naja haje</em>), the team reports August 20 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Cause of death was clear in two of the cases: The kitten was strangled, and the snake had its neck broken. The snake also suffered from kidney damage, possibly a result of water deprivation near the end of its life. Like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animal-mummies-were-message-direct-gods">many of Egypt’s mummified animals</a>, these three may have served as offerings to Egyptian gods (<em>SN: 1/6/14</em>).</p>



<p>Focusing on sections instead of just scanning the whole mummy at once allowed the team to get increased detail and create models of the mummified remains that could be 3-D printed and investigated through virtual reality. “With VR, I can effectively make the cat skull as big as my house and wander around it,” Johnston says. That’s how the team found the kitten’s unerupted molars, a clue that the animal was under five months old.</p>





<p>That novel approach to microCT scanning mummies definitely has potential, says Lidija McKnight, an archaeologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not affiliated with the study.  “These advanced techniques are extremely powerful tools to improve our understanding of this ancient practice.”  </p>



<p>Scans hint at Egyptian ritual in the snake, which had rock structures in its open mouth, possibly the mineral natron used by ancient Egyptians to slow decomposition. Ancient embalmers often <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.23140">opened the mouths and eyes</a> of mummies so the dead could see and communicate with the living, but previously this kind of procedure had primarily been seen in human mummies. Snakes, it appears, may have also whispered beyond the grave, serving as a messenger between the gods and a worshipper.</p>

<p>In their study, Prof. Holger Volk and colleagues at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover presented dogs with samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive or –negative nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.</p>
<p>This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.</p>

<p>With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer.

The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

<p>Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, Clayton <em>et al. </em>systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.</p>

<p>High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a>, Li <em>et al.</em> use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.</p>
<p>Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.</p>
<p>Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms.

<p>Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a>, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.</p>
<blockquote><p>befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.</p>

As they focus on their self-development, emerging adults feel in-between, on the way to adulthood but not there yet. Nevertheless, they have a high level of optimism about what the future holds for them.</p><p>In the current climate, emerging adults are facing more instability than ever before. Whether it’s starting university, forging new relationships, or entering the job market – the uncertainty surrounding these milestones has presented many new challenges, and exacerbated the more common anxieties of adjusting to change. We’ve put together a reading list of books that address some of the key issues facing emerging adults – in areas such as education, work, relationships, and mental health – and provide advice and approaches for managing this turbulent stage of life.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mood-prep-101-9780190914301"><strong>Mood Prep 101: A Parent’s Guide to Preventing Depression and Anxiety in College-Bound Teens</strong></a> by Carol Landau</p><p>This book answers the question most parents have – “What can we do?” – when it comes to college-bound teens who may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Of all “cross-modal” findings, the most famous is surely the bouba-kiki effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the sound <em>bouba</em> and spiky shapes with <em>kiki</em>. However, research has not yet revealed why this effect is common among adults who speak very different languages — and even in infants as young as four.</p>



<p>Various theories have been put forward. One holds that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/">levels of emotional arousal may be key</a> — that both <em>kiki </em>and a spiky shape trigger relatively high levels of arousal, compared with <em>bouba</em> and a blob. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967">new study</a>, reported in <em>Psychological Science</em>, provides compelling evidence for this idea. The researchers also take their findings further, arguing that they could have important implications for understanding the early evolution of languages.</p>


<p><span id="more-40093"></span></p>


<p>For an initial study, Arash Aryani at Freie Universität Berlin and colleagues presented English-speaking students (at Cornell University, US) with shapes and words taken from previous studies that have investigated the bouba-kiki effect. (For example, <em>maluma</em> vs <em>takete</em>, from <a href="https://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=870792">the original 1929 report </a>of this word/shape effect). In each case, the participants had to use a five-point scale to rate how calming or exciting they considered these words or shapes to be. The results revealed significantly higher arousal ratings for kiki-type than bouba-type words and shapes.</p>



<p>Next, the team asked a fresh group of participants to use the same scale to rate 940 computer-generated pseudo-words (which were all spoken in a neutral tone by an actor) for how arousing they sounded. These pseudo-words all sounded like they could be English words, but they had no meaning (think <em>tylo</em> or <em>sooking</em>, for example). Separately, the team analysed them, looking for particular acoustic features that earlier work has suggested we use to infer different emotional states. (For example, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0990">variations in the fundamental frequency of even animal sounds lead us to infer different emotions</a>, and quickly-pulsating sounds are associated with high arousal.)</p>



<p>The results showed a clear relationship — those pseudo-words that the researchers expected, based on their acoustic analysis, to trigger more arousal received higher arousal ratings from the participants. The same was true for low arousal.</p>



<p>The team then applied the acoustic model to the specific bouba-like and kiki-like words that they’d used in the first experiment. They found that the model predicted significantly higher arousal values for the kiki-like words than for the bouba-like words. This suggested, then, that the acoustic features of <em>bouba</em> and <em>kiki</em> (and similar pairs) explain the low vs high arousal ratings given by the participants in the first study.</p>



<p>Together, the results suggest that, no matter what the word (or pseudo-word), depending on its acoustic features, it will trigger different perceptions of arousal. “Any wordlike stimulus can potentially convey emotional information solely on the basis of its perceptual acoustic characteristics, making it possible to match it with emotionally similar concepts, eg. shapes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Based on the results of the second experiment, the researchers then identified groups of “high-arousal”, “medium-arousal”, and “low-arousal” pseudo-words. They asked a fresh batch of participants to match these to a range of spiky and rounded shapes (again taken from previous studies). As the team predicted, spiky shapes were most likely to be matched to high-arousal pseudo-words (followed by medium-arousal and then finally low-arousal examples), while rounded shapes were most likely to be matched to the low arousal group. “These results suggest that the extent to which a word in a bouba-kiki experiment is matched with a rounded shape or spiky shape depends on the level of arousal elicited by its sound,” the team writes. </p>



<p>The findings not only support the emotional arousal theory to explain the bouba-kiki effect but may also shed light on the early stages of language evolution, they add.</p>



<p>The finding that humans can reliably identify levels of arousal in the vocal sounds of a range of animals is telling, they think. “An initial form of vocalisation might have been a motor reflection of arousal in the vocal tract. Such vocalisations might gradually have been used to refer to external objects that were associated with similar affective experience.” So a sharp rock could become associated with high-arousal sounds (and note the “sharp” sound of <em>rock</em> vs <em>bubble</em>, say.)</p>



<p>If our early speech sounds and words were grounded in our emotional, arousal system, this could have made them easier to learn, and so more likely to be retained, the team thinks. And though most words are often held up to be arbitrary, there’s increasing evidence that this is often not the case — our word sound/meaning links go deeper than the onomatopoeia of <em>crack</em> for instance, or the ideogram of <em>zigzag</em>, and can, it seems, be grounded in our emotional responses.</p>

<p><em> By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p><em>“…Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you.”</em></p>



<p>This passage, pulled from Isaiah 41.10, is just one example of the Bible’s many references to God’s power to protect. And this protective persona might affect you much more than you think. At least that’s what emerged in 2015, when researchers from Stanford University published a string of studies finding that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614563108?casa_token=kI9UANJRFMQAAAAA%3AE1UVVQWf5QHj2jSgvhawv2kDn6w8rhexo14CmTI74rZziCnSeA-CSasanAo4lYHhFm6GvR1MF3Xe">people prompted to think of God made significantly riskier decisions</a> — whether or not they were religious.</p>


<p>The scientists’ explanation, promptly picked up by the media, was that thinking of God makes risk-taking less intimidating because it primes us to expect divine protection. As of recently, however, this narrative has not stood up to scrutiny. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477">first pre-registered replication of this study</a>, published in the journal <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests that the effect was probably no more than an exciting false positive.</p>
<p><span id="more-40080"></span></p>


<p>The failure to replicate such a high-profile experiment will probably come as a disappointment. The original publication had certainly generated a global splash, giving rise to headlines like <em>“</em><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/religion-makes-people-take-or-avoid-risks-skydiving-versus-drinking-gambling-sex.html"><em>God is my co-pilot</em></a><em>” </em>and <em>“</em><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/thank-god-for-risky-behavior"><em>Thank God for risky behaviour</em></a><em>”. </em>In many ways, the study stated a convincing case. It featured nine experiments, all of which concurred that being reminded of God triggered a significant increase in people’s tendency to take on risk. In these experiments, a mix of religious and non-religious participants from across the US were prompted to think either of God or an unrelated topic, such as astronomy. In most cases, this was achieved by having participants solve scrambled sentences, which either contained religions words (e.g. “spirit” or “divine”) or non-religious words.</p>



<p>Participants then indicated how likely they were to engage in a range of risky behaviours related to ethical dilemmas (like taking credit for someone else’s work), safety concerns (driving a car without a seatbelt) or social risk (starting a whole new career in one’s mid-thirties). The effects seemed clear. Those who had been primed to think of God were significantly more likely to consider engaging in risky behaviours, as long as these did not involve an ethical transgression. Moreover, participants in the “God-prime” condition perceived significantly less risk in all of these behaviours, as if thinking of God really had reduced the sense of threat.</p>



<p>But some researchers were concerned. Looking at the string of statistical results, many of which had just made it over the threshold of significance, one couldn’t help but wonder — what if this divine protection effect was just a statistical blip? The answer arrived a few weeks ago, when Will Gervais from the University of Kentucky and colleagues repeated two of the original 2015 experiments in exact detail, but with one crucial difference. They recruited a substantially larger sample of over a thousand participants, which was designed to give the researchers a very strong probability of detecting the “God-prime” effect, if it did really exist. Their study revealed no evidence that being primed to think of God had the power to make people choose riskier behaviours. There was no effect even when the authors ran a mini meta-analysis combining their own findings with those of the original publication.</p>



<p>So far, this failed replication has not been met with the media attention that surrounded the original paper. Perhaps that study struck a chord because it resonated with our long-held ideas about the function of religion. Many sociologists and psychologists believe that religion helps individuals deal with stress by offering a padding of divine protection, which makes the chaos and volatility of daily life less frightening. Indeed, the “God comfort hypothesis” has received considerable support from international surveys, which find that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx,%20https:/doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0021140">national levels of religion tend to go hand-in-hand with governmental instability and poor material security</a>. Strife might directly throw previously unbelieving people into the arms of God. This was observed in Christchurch, New Zealand, where researchers spotted a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049648">sudden spike in religiosity</a> in the aftermath of its devastating 2011 earthquake. Thus, when researchers discovered that the sense of security associated with God not only gives us perceived shelter from risk, but actually emboldens us to seek it out, their findings might have enjoyed some degree of automatic credibility.</p>



<p>But experience should have taught us that caution is the better policy. Researchers have failed to replicate a host of high-profile discoveries,  <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">from the controversial effects of “power posing”</a> on our confidence and stress hormones, to the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/16/another-social-psychology-classic-bites-the-dust-meta-analysis-finds-little-evidence-for-the-macbeth-effect">Macbeth Effect</a>, which claims that having our moral purity threatened makes us literally want to clean ourselves. As psychological science works to recover from its replication crisis, and scientific editors increasingly realise the importance of publishing negative results, communicators of popular science may need to be careful about overstating the certainty of new and exciting findings. As with the God-priming effect, some discoveries might not be scientific scripture after all.</p>

<p class="">The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. It is located in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>. </p><h2>What is the fusiform face area and what does it do?</h2><p class="">By the late 1990s, researchers had built up a fair amount of evidence that suggested there are parts of our brain that are especially active when we look at faces. This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. </p><p class="">In 1997, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/" target="_blank">researchers published a groundbreaking study</a> that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri" target="_blank">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a> to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.</p><p class="">The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the <em>fusiform face area</em>, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as <em>prosopagnosia</em>, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.</p><p class="">Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/" target="_blank">found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery</a>, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/" target="_blank">caused disruptions in the perception of faces</a>. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term <em>fusiform face area</em>—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.</p><p class="">Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/">some argue</a> that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/">a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well</a>. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. </p><p class="">But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the <em>expertise hypothesis</em>, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/" target="_blank">one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased</a> in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/" target="_blank">Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts</a> viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/" target="_blank">another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA</a> when viewing x-rays than med students did. </p><p class="">The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/" target="_blank">a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies</a> found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. </p><p class=""><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></p><p class="">Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Music and humans go back a very long way. The earliest accepted instruments, made from bones, appear on the European scene about 40,000 years ago. But for perhaps at least a million years before that, our ancestors had the throat architecture that in theory would have allowed them to sing.</p>
<p>All kinds of ideas have been put forward for why and how music came to matter so much to us. But what’s abundantly clear is that it <em>does</em> matter; there isn’t a society out there that doesn’t make and listen to music. And new research is now revealing all manner of psychological and neurological effects…<span id="more-40074"></span></p>
<h3>But what about people who don’t like music?</h3>
<p>Music is a human universal, but it’s true — not everyone enjoys music. In fact, as a 2014 paper published in <em>Current Biology</em> revealed, some perfectly healthy people can perceive music just like anybody else, but <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00133-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096098221400133X?showall=true">their reward-related neural circuits don’t respond to it</a>. (These circuits do still respond to food or money, for example, so it’s not that they’re generally defective).</p>
<p>In fact, an <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/31/2/118/62587/Individual-Differences-in-Music-Reward-Experiences">estimated 3-5% of people</a> experience “musical anhedonia”, and get no pleasure from music. (To find out where you sit on the music reward spectrum, you could fill in the team’s questionnaire, available <a href="http://brainvitge.org/z_oldsite/bmrq.php">here</a>.) Last year, a team that included some of the same researchers published a follow-up study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>. They <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/25/5018">found a neurobiological basis for their earlier observations</a>: differences in the white matter “wiring” that connects the auditory cortex and the ventral striatum, a key part of the reward system. What causes these differences is not yet clear.</p>
<h3>For the rest of us, what is it about a piece of music that gives us pleasure?</h3>
<p>Last year, a team led by Vincent Cheung at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany published an <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31258-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982219312588?showall=true">analysis of responses to 745 US Billboard pop songs</a>. They found that expectancy is key. When listeners were pretty certain about which chord to expect next (based on what had come before), they found it pleasurable to be surprised. When they weren’t sure what to expect, though, more predictable subsequent chords were pleasing.</p>
<p>Popular songs strike a good balance between both subverting expectation and reassuring listeners, the team concluded. “It is fascinating that humans can derive pleasure from a piece of music just by how sounds are ordered over time,” Cheung commented. It is also important for understanding how music influences our emotional state…</p>
<h3>Why do we like listening to sad music?</h3>
<p>The first point to stress is that we don’t all necessarily like it. In 2016, a team led by Tuomas Eerola at the University of Durham <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157444">reported on the emotional experiences connected with sad music</a> of 2,436 people in the UK and Finland. The majority said they enjoyed sad music, and that this pleasure boosted their mood. “However, there are people who absolutely hate sad-sounding music and avoid listening to it,” notes Eerola. The study revealed that for these people, sad music was associated with painful personal experiences, such as loss.</p>
<p>Still, the reports of mood-<em>boosting</em> effects from the majority is important. In 2015, a paper titled “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295">Sad as a Matter of Choice?</a>” reported that people with depression were more likely to listen to sad songs — which the team controversially took to imply that they were maintaining or even worsening their own low mood. Last year, however, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001">a study published in <em>Emotion</em></a> found that depressed people prefer sad music because it is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/">calming and even uplifting</a>. As some participants in another recent study commented, when you’re feeling low, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/">sad music can seem like a supportive friend</a>.</p>
<h3>Extreme emotions</h3>
<p>Some pieces of music have dramatic effects on us. “Peak emotional states” involve powerful physical responses, such as tears, or feeling “the chills”, and often extreme sadness or joy. They can be triggered by something inherently deeply meaningful — such as childbirth — but also by a beautiful view, or piece of music. A 2017 study published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/02/psychologists-have-studied-whats-happening-when-music-gives-us-chills-or-makes-us-cry/">explored these reactions</a>, and found that song-induced tears were associated with subsequent calming — they seem, then, to have a cathartic, relieving function.</p>
<p>Some people, though, are more prone than others to feeling goosebumps or a shiver down the spine in response to a piece of music. And as a paper recently published in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em> has revealed, such people have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/884/2223400">stronger connectivity between auditory processing and social and emotional processing areas</a> of the brain. These same connectivity differences have also been linked to greater empathy. As the researchers write in their paper: “Perhaps one of the reasons why music is a cross-culturally indispensable artifact is that it appeals directly through an auditory channel to emotional and social processing centers of the human brain.” Only, it does this more for some of us than others.</p>
<h3>Connecting brains</h3>
<p>One proposed adaptive function for music is that it unites individuals. With music, we can march together, dance together, and express emotions as one. And there’s now growing evidence that this unity can occur right down at the neural level.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, Ulman Lindenberger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and colleagues reported that when two guitarists play the same piece of music together, their brainwaves synchronise. Big deal, you might think: they’re processing and playing identical notes, so why shouldn’t there be similarities in their brain activity? However, in 2012, the team <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00312/full">reported a follow-up</a> involving duets with <em>different </em>guitar parts. When these pairs had to actively coordinate their playing, there was a synchronisation in activity in some regions <em>between</em> the two. This, the team concluded, was evidence of “inter-brain networks”. “When people coordinate actions with one another, small networks within the brain and, remarkably, between the brains are formed,” noted Johanna Sänger, lead author of this study.</p>
<p>Since then, more evidence of inter-brain synchronisation during musical experiences has emerged. It’s known that when audience members are enjoying a piece of live music, their brainwaves tend to synchronise. And, earlier this year, a team led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University revealed that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/">when a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, a synchronisation in brain activity develops.</a> The team were even able to use the strength of this “inter-brain coherence” to predict how much the audience reported enjoying a piece.</p>
<h3>Use the beat</h3>
<p>Humans are unique as a species in being able to perceive beat. And there’s all kinds of evidence that the tempo of a piece of music affects our behaviour. A classic study, published back in 1986, found that diners in a Dallas restaurant <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489234?seq=1">ate significantly faster</a> when faster tempo (more beats per minute) music was played, compared with slow tempo music. These findings went on to influence the choice of soundtracks in restaurants the world over. But there’s also recent <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00074/full">evidence that listening to high-tempo music while exercising can increase heart rate</a> more than slow-tempo music and also make the exercise feel less difficult. “This means that the exercise seemed like less effort but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,” commented researcher Luca P. Ardigò of the University of Verona in Italy.</p>
<h3>Background effects</h3>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who likes to have background music playing while you work, there are a couple of studies worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p>Listening even to music that you enjoy <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.1731">can interfere with working memory</a>, which could impair mental arithmetic, a study published in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> has found. And though it has been suggested that music can encourage creativity, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3532">in fact it “significantly impairs” it</a>, according to a 2019 paper published in the same journal. The researchers, from the UK and Sweden, gave participants verbal insight problems, which are meant to tap into creativity. (For example, they were given the words “dress”, “dial”, and “flower”, and asked to identify a single word that could be combined with each — “sun”). Background music with foreign lyrics, instrumental music without lyrics and music with familiar lyrics <em>all </em>made the participants worse at this. Again, the researchers think that this is because music disrupts working memory; in this case, verbal working memory. “To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content, consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving,” they write.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the negative impact of familiar music was observed even when a participant said it boosted their mood, reported liking the song, or said that they typically studied with background music playing. So if you do typically work with music, and think it helps, surely it’s worth at least trying to go without.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>When it comes to leading a happy and fulfilled life, many of us focus on long-term goals: what job we want, whether or not we want children, or how to reach a certain level of skill at a particular hobby or interest. There’s a reason so much research looks at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/">how to achieve</a> the things you value in life.</p>
<p>As such, we often (try to) eschew short-term pleasures, deeming them a distraction from loftier goals. But according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220941998">a study in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a><em>, </em>the pursuit of those more immediate pleasures could be just as important for our wellbeing.</p>
<p><span id="more-40066"></span>The ability to engage in short term pleasures might not be the same for everybody, reasoned the researchers, Katharina Bernecker from the University of Zurich and Daniela Becker from Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien. In other words, some people may be more liable to fail at achieving short-term pleasurable goals because they’re too focused on long-term ones. So in the first study, the team developed a self-report scale to assess individual differences in this ability to pursue “hedonic” goals. Questions measured hedonic success, or how well people manage to pursue short term pleasures (e.g. “in my spare time, I can relax well”), and intrusive thoughts about long term goals whilst engaging in short term pleasures (e.g. “I cannot stop myself from thinking about things I still need to do”).</p>
<p>In the next pair of studies, the team used the scale to investigate whether people with high or low hedonic capacity experience greater wellbeing. In the first, participants answered questions from the World Health Organization wellbeing scale, which measures cognitive and emotional wellbeing, while in the second, participants completed the Satisfaction With Life scale, rating themselves on items like “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”. Hedonic capacity and self-control were assessed in both, as were physical symptoms (e.g. dizziness and faintness), including those of depression and anxiety (e.g. “nervousness or shakiness inside”).</p>
<p>Participants’ hedonic capacity was significantly and positively related to both general wellbeing and life satisfaction: people with a greater capacity to pursue short-term pleasures were also happier in their lives. Self-control (which is needed to achieve long-term goals) was also positively associated with wellbeing, but the effect of hedonic capacity was greater. Greater hedonic capacity was also related to fewer physical symptoms.</p>
<p>In a third study, hedonic capacity was measured before participants took place in a ten minute relaxation session, during which they stated how many intrusive thoughts they experienced. Before and after this session, participants rated how relaxed, tense, or alert they felt. As expected, those with higher levels of hedonic capacity experienced fewer intrusive thoughts during the relaxation phase; in addition, people who experienced more intrusive thoughts didn’t find the session as relaxing as those who did not.</p>
<p>To explore the findings in a real life setting, a fourth study recruited participants in specific contexts — e.g. a cafe, park or in a yoga class. Participants filled in a survey assessing their hedonic capacity and trait self-control, and indicated how much they were enjoying themselves in the moment and their reasons for being there. Companions of the participants also filled in a questionnaire judging the participants’ pleasure in the moment. Again, those with high hedonic capacity reported having a more positive experience and were also judged by others as having a better experience. A further study confirmed these findings.</p>
<p>So while a focus on long-term goals and self-control may increase wellbeing, it seems as if short-term pleasures are also a key factor — though intrusive thoughts can hamper this process, as results from the third study suggested.</p>
<p>Of course, self-control is important to some degree — giving in to every whim you experience probably isn’t going to equal a particularly healthy existence, as the team notes: a balance between the two is likely to result in higher levels of wellbeing.</p>
<p>If you’re the sort of person who finds it hard to enjoy short-term pleasures and are more likely to experience intrusive thoughts, this balance might be harder to come by than you might hope. But giving yourself permission to eat, drink and be merry could do more for your wellbeing than you might have expected.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></h4>

<p>How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?</p><p>Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.</p><p>So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.</p><p>First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.</p><p>Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.</p><p>Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.<strong> </strong>I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.</p><p>Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.</p><p>Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children<strong> </strong>better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues.

A homeopathy journal that Elsevier dropped in the wake of concerns about excessive self-citation appears to have carved out a new niche for itself: self-pity.  In 2016, Homeopathy lost its slot on Thomson Reuters’s (now Clarivate’s)  influential journal rankings list after an analysis found that more than 70% of citations in the papers it published … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/17/did-a-journal-retract-your-paper-on-homeopathy-meet-the-journal-that-will-publish-your-complaint/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Did a journal retract your paper on homeopathy?

The University of Münster in Germany shows with a good example how to act on evidence of data manipulation. Neuroscientist Andreas Püschel has been found guilty of research misconduct. It was once again about a paper authored by his former PhD student and now Luxembourg stem cell researcher, Jens Schwamborn.

<p><strong>We really struggle to wrap our heads around the idea of exponential growth</strong>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200812-exponential-growth-bias-the-numerical-error-behind-covid-19">writes David Robson</a> at <em>BBC Future</em>. Instead, we tend to rely on our intuitions and think of growth as linear even when it is not — which could help to explain why many people underestimated the dangers of coronavirus spreading. Researchers say that politicians and the media should be doing more to try and highlight the exponential nature of transmission in an attempt to correct this mathematical bias.<span id="more-40058"></span></p>

<p><strong>For a lot of the country, this week has been unpleasantly hot. </strong>And aside from the physical risks, heatwaves can have a variety of effects on our mental health, <a href="https://theconversation.com/heatwaves-dont-just-give-you-sunburn-they-can-harm-your-mental-health-too-121203">writes Harriet Ingle</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>

<p><strong>To combat global problems like climate change, we need to alter our behaviour in ways that might come at a personal cost, even though they benefit the wider community</strong>. So how do you encourage people to adopt these prosocial attitudes? Making people feel guilty is not the answer, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/you-want-people-to-do-the-right-thing-save-them-the-guilt-trip">explains Claudia R Schnieder</a> at <em>Psyche</em>. Her research has found that appealing to positive emotions, such as pride in doing the right thing, is more effective at encouraging pro-environmental and prosocial behaviours.</p>

<p><strong>Neuroscientists studying animals have traditionally examined how the brain responds to sensory information, or how patterns of brain activity directly relate to an animal’s behaviour. </strong>But now they’re beginning to look at something altogether more complex: the way in which neuronal activity is related to an animal’s internal state, such as its emotions or drives. At <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02337-x">Alison Abbott has written a fascinating feature</a> on the challenges of probing an animal’s frame of mind.</p>

<p><strong>A systematic review has found that, for a small number of people, mindfulness and meditation can have unwanted effects like a worsening of anxiety</strong>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2251840-mindfulness-and-meditation-can-worsen-depression-and-anxiety/">reports Clare Wilson</a> at <em>New Scientist</em>. Other researchers say that the study shouldn’t put people off doing meditation, but suggest they do it in a safe context such as guided meditation sessions. For more on mindfulness, it’s worth <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/">checking out our podcast</a> from last year.</p>

<p><strong>Grey reef sharks form surprisingly strong social ties</strong>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902157235/everyone-needs-a-buddy-even-sharks">report Christopher Intagliata</a> at <em>NPR</em>. Researchers found that the sharks form groups of up to 20 individuals, who they hang out with for years. Being part of a social group gives the sharks certain advantages, such as learning from others where to hunt for food.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, I missed <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-correlation-causation-taboo">this piece</a> last month from Neuroskeptic (whose posts are always worth reading). </strong>We all know that correlation does not equal causation — but a paper argues that considering causal inference “taboo” simply results in psychologists making these claims in a more subtle or implicit way. The researchers examined influential studies based on observational data and, as Neuroskeptic puts it, “find evidence of unstated causal claims and assumptions, swept under a correlational rug.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Recent years have seen the government take measures to try and limit people’s consumption of sugary drinks and other unhealthy foods. Take the so-called “sugar tax” placed on soft drinks, for instance, or the proposal to ban adverts for junk food before the 9pm watershed.</p>
<p>Some psychologists hope that small changes in design can also help “nudge” people into healthier behaviours. For example, a study from last year found that the order in which drinks are presented on the McDonald’s menu could <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/">encourage people to choose the sugar-free options</a> more often.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> suggests that the shape of a glass could also subtly influence people’s drinking behaviours.</p>
<p><span id="more-40050"></span></p>
<p>Past work had found that people were slower to drink both beer and soft drinks from glasses with straight sides compared to those with outward-sloping sides. But it was unclear whether there was any effect on the total amount consumed or exactly <em>why</em> the shape of a glass should have an effect.</p>
<p>To investigate these questions, Tess Langfield from the University of Cambridge and colleagues conducted a series of experiments using different shaped glasses. First, the team gave 198 participants a fizzy apple drink in either a straight-sided tumbler, or one with sides that sloped outwards. The participants were allowed to drink at their leisure while watching a nature documentary.</p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption alignnone" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_40053" style="width: 823px;"><img alt="Langfield et al (2020)" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40053" data-attachment-id="40053" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Langfield et al (2020)" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=823" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png" data-orig-size="823,398" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/13/the-shape-of-a-glass-can-influence-how-much-we-drink/langfield-et-al-2020/" height="398" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png" width="823" />The glasses used in the first study (left; each glass contains 330ml of apple drink) and second and third studies (right; each glass contains 165ml of passion fruit drink). Via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6">Langfield et al (2020)</a></figure><p></p>
<p>The team found no difference in the total time participants spent drinking from each kind of glass. But those who drank from the sloping glass did show a more “decelerated” pattern of drinking: they tended to drink more of the drink in the first half of the session than the second half.</p>
<p>Participants were then asked to fill the glass until it was half-full. Those with the sloping glass tended to underestimate where the midpoint was compared to those with the straight-sided glass. That makes sense: if a glass slopes outwards, there is more volume at the top than at the bottom, so the midpoint is higher that it might initially seem.</p>
<p>These findings suggest glass shape could influence people’s pace of drinking, and potentially their perceptions of how much they’ve had to drink. But they don’t reveal anything about the actual amount consumed. So in a second study, the team asked participants to perform a (fake) taste-test, rating four passion fruit drinks, half served in straight-sided champagne flutes and half in sloped martini glasses.</p>
<p>Participants did indeed drink significantly less from the champagne flutes than the martini glasses. They also took smaller sips from the champagne flutes. This time, however, glass shape didn’t influence people’s accuracy at finding the midpoint of the glass, suggesting that this kind of perceptual bias couldn’t explain why people drank less from the straight-sided glasses.</p>
<p>Instead, the researchers wondered whether the results could be related to the physical shape of the lips when sipping from each kind of glass. So in a final experiment, they had participants drink from the champagne and martini glasses while their face was rigged up with electrodes to measure muscle activity. The team found that people’s lips were more pursed when sipping from the straight-sided flute than the sloped martini glass, and there was some evidence that pursing the lips more was related to taking smaller sips.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the study suggests that sloping glasses can cause us to drink more of a soft drink — but this seems to be due to the way the shape affects the actual mechanics of how we sip from a glass, rather than the result of perceptual biases.</p>
<p>So should health-conscious bars and restaurants start chucking out their sloping glasses? Well, it seems pretty clear that more work needs to be done in real world settings. Drinking in a bogus taste-test in the lab — particularly when hooked up to electrodes — is a far cry from how people might consume soft drinks in daily life. And it remains unclear whether the results hold for alcohol as well as soft drinks.</p>
<p>The last two studies also used glasses which normally have quite specific purposes: they’re used for serving sparkling wine and cocktails. Could participants’ associations with those drinks have influenced their behaviour? Maybe they’re used to sipping slowly on champagne, for instance, while more readily knocking back martinis. Unlikely, perhaps, but it seems worth also exploring the effects of glasses with novel designs that are free from these kinds of existing associations.</p>
<p>Still, the study shows that the design of our drinkware is worth examining in the context of public health. And even small “nudges” could theoretically have a large impact at a population level, particularly alongside other measures. “In combination with other behaviour change strategies, adopting straight-sided glasses may prove to be one intervention contributing to the many needed to reduce consumption of drinks that harm health,” the team concludes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a></h4>

<p>In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted">petitioned</a> for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder">granted clemency</a> and Brown was released from prison.</p><p>As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742">leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system</a>.</p><p>A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims</a>, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">told</a> her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.</p><p>Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color</a>, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10">which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights<em> </em>and pressure them to waive their rights</a>—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.</p><p>Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">often perceived</a> as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.</p><p>Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">often blamed</a> for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">more likely to be tried in adult criminal court</a> rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back">Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.</a></p><p>Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/">Image</a> by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/" rel="nofollow">How education could reduce corruption</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-criminal-justice-systems-big-data-problem/" rel="nofollow">The criminal justice system’s big data problem</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1">Food security</a> – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.</p>
<p>Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Food assistance</strong></p>
<p>Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/">prior studies</a> that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women</p></blockquote>
<p>Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing disparities</strong></p>
<p>This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.</p>
<p>Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ihd7XnvNt8g/">PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics</a></h4>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.</p>



<p>A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.</p>



<p>While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.</p>



<p>“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”</p>



<p>These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.</p>



<p>“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>You’ll be familiar with the concept of the “successful psychopath”. Like regular psychopaths, such people are callous and manipulative, self-seeking, and free from guilt — but rather than ending up behind bars, they are able to flourish in their careers.</p>
<p>However, though the concept of the successful psychopath is popular, it’s also contentious. That’s because there’s been a lack of data to substantiate it, or to explain it. But now, ten years after <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/08/18/hunting-the-successful-psychopath/">an initial study hinted that levels of the personality trait of conscientiousness might be important</a> for understanding the path to “successful” vs criminal psychopathy, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45069-001">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment</em>, provides more robust support for that idea.</p>
<p><span id="more-40043"></span></p>
<p>The work published back in 2010 started with a survey of psychology and law specialists, criminal attorneys and professors of clinical psychology in the US. These people were asked if they’d ever known someone who matched <a href="http://www.hare.org">Robert Hare’s definition of a psychopath</a>, but who was successful in life. If so, they were asked to provide personality and psychopathy assessments for them. One key difference between successful and standard psychopaths emerged: successful psychopaths were reported as having higher levels of conscientiousness. Rather than being impulsive and irresponsible, they seemed to be more self-disciplined and driven to achieve.</p>
<p>This conclusion was based solely on reports of people who thought they knew someone who fitted the bill, however. Now Emily Lasko and David S. Chester at Virginia Commonwealth University have studied relatively successful vs unsuccessful psychopathic individuals directly.</p>
<p>The pair used a total of seven years of data on 1,354 American adolescent offenders for their study. As all of these adolescents had initially committed a serious offence (such as sexual assault or a weapons offence), the “successful” vs “unsuccessful” distinction was tied to re-offending. Adolescents who did not re-offend were classed as “successful”, whereas those who’d re-offended at least once were deemed to be “unsuccessful”. Every six months during the study, the adolescents completed surveys of psychopathic traits and also separate measures of their ability to control their impulses and suppress feelings of aggression, as well as self-reporting any offences.</p>
<p>Lasko and Chester found that participants who’d initially scored highly for grandiose-manipulative psychopathic traits (traits associated with arrogance and self-centredness as well as manipulativeness) went on to show steeper increases over time in two forms of conscientiousness: impulse control and the suppression of aggression. Importantly, this effect was notably larger within the “successful” group. It seems, then, that successful psychopaths are those who show real improvements at controlling their impulses, to achieve their goals. “This exacerbated development of conscientiousness-defining traits is likely able to compensate for the heightened antisocial tendencies of these psychopathic individuals, bringing them into a self-regulatory balance that enables them to function in society,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>The team tried altering the number of re-offences that led to an individual being categorised as successful vs unsuccessful, but this did not materially change the pattern of the results. As an alternative measure of “success”, they also considered whether or not participants were enrolled in school at each time point. The link between conscientiousness-related traits and success held. “This suggests that our findings are likely to generalise across various forms of ‘success’,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Clearly, more work will be needed to investigate the factors contributing to the development of greater or poorer impulse control, and how to enhance it in this population, perhaps to increase the proportion of relatively successful rather than criminal psychopaths.</p>
<p>Overall, though, the research supports the idea of “successful” vs regular psychopaths, as well as finding evidence for a key difference between the two. “These findings show the importance of the five-factor model to understanding the nuances of psychopathy and its various phenotypes,” the researchers write.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Friendship tends to be based on some kind of shared experience: growing up with someone, working with them, or having the same interests. Politics is an important factor too, with <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413510932">research</a> suggesting that we can be pretty intolerant of those with different political positions — not an ideal starting point for friendship.</p>
<p>This can have a significant and tangible impact. One Reuters/Ipsos <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-relationships-insight/from-disputes-to-a-breakup-wounds-still-raw-after-u-s-election-idUSKBN15M13L">poll</a>, for example, found 16.4% of people had stopped talking to a family member or friend after Trump was elected, while 17.4% had blocked someone they care about on social media.</p>
<p>So what happens when you find out a trusted friend has different politics to you? They don’t fare well, according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407520939191">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> authored by Elena Buliga and Cara MacInnis from the University of Calgary, Canada.</p>
<p><span id="more-40038"></span></p>
<p>Participants were recruited from across the political spectrum: 70 identified as Republicans, whilst 142 described themselves as Democrats. As well as reporting their political identity, participants rated their opinions on social and economic policy, on a scale from very liberal (0) to very conservative (10). They also rated how important their political orientation is to their identity and completed a “feeling thermometer”, which measured  how favourably or unfavourably they felt towards members of other political parties.</p>
<p>After the pre-test measures were complete, participants were presented with four vignettes in a random order. In the first, participants were asked to imagine meeting someone at a party with the same political views as them; another vignette detailed the same experience, only this time the potential friend had <em>different</em> political views.</p>
<p>In the final two vignettes, participants were instructed to think about a real or hypothetical close friend whose views they were not already aware of and asked to imagine a conversation in which their friend outlined their political beliefs. In the first, participants imagined their friend espousing a shared political belief, while in the second they turned out to be a member of a political out-group instead.</p>
<p>After reading each of the four vignettes, participants rated how excited, happy, pleased, satisfied, surprised, upset, anxious and worried they would feel in the situation and answered questions on how willing they would be to maintain that friendship (e.g. “would you make an effort to spend time with this person?”). They also rated their trust and satisfaction in, and hope for, the ongoing friendship.</p>
<p>Finally, participants indicated how much they would expect their feelings to change towards the person in each vignette, as well as rating attitudes towards them from “extremely unfavourable” to “extremely favourable”.</p>
<p>Overall, people were more positive towards in-group members than out-group members: participants had more trust in and hope for the longevity of relationships with both friends and strangers of the same political leanings as them than they did even for established friends with different politics. Positive emotions were highest when discovering a friend had shared beliefs, followed by the stranger with shared beliefs. Out-group friends and out-group strangers tailed behind.</p>
<p>Negative affect was also highest for the friend with different political views, followed by the out-group stranger. This makes sense — you’re likely to be much more invested (and therefore much more disappointed) in a friend than someone you don’t know.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear, however, who exactly participants were imagining when asked to think of a friend, meaning there may have been significant variation in closeness and therefore in emotional response; some participants may also have been thinking of a hypothetical friend, which could also have had an impact on the results. The measures also only looked at immediate reactions — it’s very possible that after discovering a friend is of a different political persuasion,  participants could calm down or mellow out over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>It’s probably also important to note that the results aren’t necessarily going to represent every relationship — lots of people have cherished friends with very different politics to their own. <em>How</em> those relationships are successfully managed and navigated may be one focus for future research.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Starting a new habit isn’t always easy — we probably only have to look at our own history of failed <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/">New Year’s Resolutions</a> to know that. One common frustration is that things don’t happen fast enough — we start doing something that’s supposedly good for us but don’t see a significant behaviour change as quickly as we’d hoped.</p>
<p>That certainly seems to be the case with exercise, at least according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01530/full">new study</a> in <em>Frontiers in Psychology. </em>It found that people only feel they’ve become more active when they increase the amount of <em>vigorous</em> activity they do —  if it’s moderate, they don’t feel like they’ve changed at all.</p>
<p><span id="more-40034"></span>In the first study, Hermann Szymczak from the University of Konstanz and colleagues collected data from 605 participants taking part in a longitudinal study looking at health behaviour. First, participants were asked to report their physical activity for each of the last 7 days: vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity and walking. Six months later, participants also reported their perceived change in physical activity since the first time point, choosing one statement they felt best summed up their behaviour: “yes, I became more physically active”, “no, but I tried to become more physically active”, “no and I have not tried” and “no, because I was already physically active before”. At both time points, objective fitness was measured via a bicycle test.</p>
<p>In a second study, the same data was gathered from 382 participants from two more time points in the longitudinal study.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who said their behaviour had changed (“changers”) showed an increase in <em>vigorous</em> activity of about 52 and 86 minutes per week in the first and second studies respectively. Changers did not exhibit any changes in <em>moderate</em> activity, however. This suggests that an increase in intense physical activity is much more influential in making people feel that their behaviour has changed. (Changers also showed increased fitness in the bicycle test, at least in the first study).</p>
<p>There are obvious ramifications to these findings. If people only see vigorous activity as a worthwhile endeavour, it could lead to some pushing themselves too hard — and it could put others off completely, meaning they lose the many benefits of even light exercise. Previous research has also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-006-1014-4">suggested</a> this might be the case, so developing public service messaging that makes clear the health benefits of non-intense exercise might have a serious impact.</p>
<p>Future research could look at fitness norms — what narratives exist about moderate and intensive exercise, and how are they disseminated? This could go some way towards understanding <em>why</em> people don’t feel a difference with moderate exercise, as well as informing any changes in messaging to boost motivation and encourage even small behaviour changes.</p>
<p>As the team also notes, perceived behaviour change is a key part of actual behaviour change: if people see positive developments in themselves or their skills, they’re both more likely to believe the changes will last and more able to commit. Thinking about and implementing small changes in behaviour, therefore, may be particularly useful if you’re looking to maintain a habit in the long term. And if you’re feeling bad about a day or week off exercise? Don’t worry — vegging out is just as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/16/forgive-yourself-for-relaxing-in-front-of-the-tv-and-the-couch-time-might-actually-do-you-some-good/">necessary</a> sometimes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a></h4>

<p>One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/">report</a> by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.</p><p>The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.</p><p>This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”</p><p>A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards">criteria</a> for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths">myth</a> that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.</p><p>Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589">biologically-based disorders</a>, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">one study</a>, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.</p><p>We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">National Institutes of Health</a>, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm">tuberculosis</a>. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml">depression</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf">$69/person for schizophrenia</a> research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines">28 FDA-approved medications for depression</a> versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.</p><p>We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be. In that same <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">study</a> where we found that suicide was the leading cause of death, we found that an eating disorder was never listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Instead, we saw causes such as heart and liver failure in a 39-year-old woman who weighed less than half what a woman her age and height should weigh – less than half. In the absence of universal screening, we lose our best opportunity to prevent those deaths.</p><blockquote><p>We need to recognize eating disorders as serious mental illnesses that pose a threat to the health of our nation.</p><p>We need better health care coverage.</p><p>We need more funding for research.</p><p>We need universal screening.</p></blockquote><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><em>by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yGUuMIqjIrU">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633090054/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a></h4>

<p>A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600">investigated</a> which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21<sup>st</sup>-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.</p><p>The World Economic Forum’s <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">Future of Jobs Report 2018</a></em> took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.</p><p>These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">AP Computer Science Principles</a>. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.</p><p>The College Board <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles">announced</a> that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.</p><p>A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail">article</a> in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.</p><p>Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project">announced</a> that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.</p><p>A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf">approximately 30%</a> of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.</p><p>Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.</p><p><em>Featured Image credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/">Image</a> by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/" rel="nofollow">It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li></ul> </div>

It allows execution of networks of Izhikevich spiking neurons with realistic synaptic dynamics using multiple off-the-shelf GPUs and x86 CPUs. The simulator provides a PyNN-like programming interface in C/C++, which allows for details and parameters to be specified at the synapse, neuron, and network level.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The present release, CARLsim 5, builds on the efficiency and scalability of earlier releases (Nageswaran et al., 2009; Richert et al., 2011, and Beyeler et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2018). The functionality of the simulator has been greatly expanded by the addition of a number of features that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.</span></p><br /><h2 style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">New Features</span></span></h2><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></span></div><h3 style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1.

<p><strong>The world is designed for —  and by — extraverts, forcing introverts to try and adapt to society</strong>, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/introverts-are-excluded-unfairly-in-an-extraverts-world">writes Noa Herz</a> at <em>Psyche</em>. But it’s unfair to place the onus on introverts, Herz argues, writing that simple changes could make work and educational settings more welcoming places for a group that makes up around a third of the population.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="more-40026"></span><strong>Loneliness can manifest differently according to your age group, </strong><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/people-experience-loneliness-differently-depending-on-their-age/">reports Amy Barrett</a> at <em>BBC Science Focus</em>. Researchers looking at data from thousands of adults in the Netherlands found that factors like living alone and psychological distress were associated with loneliness across all ages. But there were other factors that seemed more related to loneliness at particular times in people’s lives: for instance, younger people showed the greatest association between contact with friends and loneliness, while older adults showed an association between health and loneliness. The work suggests interventions need to be tailored to age groups.</p>

<p><strong>What do children think of adults? </strong>A new paper explores the beliefs kids have about their caregivers’ own thoughts, behaviours, and failings. The project was unique, in that it was led and designed by the kids themselves. At <em>The Conversation</em>, (adult) co-authors <a href="https://theconversation.com/children-reveal-what-they-really-think-of-adults-in-their-own-research-paper-144025">Emma Maynard and Sarah Barton explain the work</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Viewing abstract art actually makes us think with a more abstract mindset</strong>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/abstract-art-mindset-study">reports Emma Betuel</a> at <em>Inverse</em>. Researchers had participants view abstract or realistic paintings, then asked them to act as art critics deciding when and where to display the art. Abstract paintings tended to be displayed further away in both time and physical distance, demonstrating the way abstract art evokes “psychological distance”, making us think more conceptually and less in terms of concrete details.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Children who have experienced violence or trauma show signs of faster aging</strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/03/children-who-suffer-violence-or-trauma-age-faster-study-finds">reports Nicola Davis</a> at <em>The Guardian</em>. An analysis of dozens of studies found that these experiences tended to be related to earlier puberty in girls, as well as greater cellular aging and thinning of certain brain areas. However, the effects were small and more work is needed to understand the nature of the relationship, researchers say.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Finally, some pigeon psychology: scientists have found that attaching weights to the smaller birds results in them becoming more aggressive and rising up the social pecking order. </strong>The researchers are not entirely sure why, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899438701/attaching-small-weights-to-pigeons-helps-them-shoot-up-in-the-social-hierarchy?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=science">report Ari Shapiro and Stacey Vanek Smith</a> at <em>NPR</em>: the weights may have helped the pigeons feel in “better shape”, or the birds may have ended up hunting food more aggressively, as they needed to consume more calories. Either way, it matters because scientists routinely attach tracking devices to birds which give them extra weight.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.</p><p>First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.<strong> </strong>Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/">Family Based Therapy</a>, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext">treatment approach of choice</a> for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.</p><p>Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.<strong> </strong>Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.<strong> </strong>The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.</p><p>Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/">negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors</a>. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/">body neutral is the place to aim</a>.<strong> </strong></p><p>Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It <em>is</em> important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is <em>not </em>their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.</p><p>Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm"><em>Image</em></a><em> by prostooleh via Freepik</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/" rel="nofollow">Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/" rel="nofollow">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li></ul> </div>

Anyone affiliated with a research institute was able to enter and we were amazed by both the quality and variety of submissions.</p>
<p>As always, our <em>BMC Ecology</em> Section Editors lent their expertise to judge the many entrants to the competition, selecting the best images from their area of research as well as the overall winner. Our accompanying editorial gives more information about the winning images, the stories behind them and why they were picked. This also includes a selection of 7 highly commended images; there are some really great photos so please do take a look!</p>
<p>Here are our winning images:</p>
<h2><strong>Overall winner:</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12056" style="width: 582px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12056" height="368" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Sick-2-300x193.jpg" width="572" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: David Costantini</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our overall winning image was taken by David Costantini from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Viruses are a significant ecological concern because they are responsible for a variety of pathological effects in wildlife. This photograph is of a magnificent frigatebird (<em>Fregata magnificens</em>) chick, suffering from a viral infection from which, unfortunately,  it isn’t likely to recover.</p>
<h2><strong>Runner up:</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12057" style="width: 592px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12057" height="388" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-green-lizard-2-300x200.jpg" width="582" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: S S Suresh.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our runner up, in sharp contrast to our overall winner, is an image showcasing the vibrant colors of a forest green lizard (<em>Calotes calotes</em>). Dr S S Suresh from the Ibri Regional Referral Hospital in Oman captured this stunning photograph after spotting a pair of the iguanian lizards in their breeding plumage.</p>
<h2><strong>Behavioral and Physiological Ecology</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12058" style="width: 457px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12058" height="671" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/zombie-fungus-2-200x300.jpeg" width="447" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: Damien Esquerré</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our winner in this category, taken by Damien Esquerré from the Australian National University, is entitled “Zombie fungus” and with good reason. The unfortunate weevil shown has been infected by Cordyceps, a fungus that infects insects, controls their behavior and then kills them.</p>
<h2><strong>Community, population and macro-ecology</strong></h2>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Fostering a positive identification with science is an important part of many programmes trying to make STEM more diverse. This is vital, as underrepresented groups may be faced with cultural stereotypes about science: that scientists are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/16/kids-are-more-motivated-to-do-science-than-be-a-scientist-a-finding-that-could-help-address-the-professions-diversity-problem/">mainly White men</a>, for example. These kinds of experiences can reinforce inequalities: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/777458/Attitudes_towards_STEM_subjects_by_gender_at_KS4.pdf">governmental research</a> from 2019, for example, found that girls were far less likely to see themselves as good at science-related subjects, and enjoyed them less — despite outperforming their male peers at exams. .</p>
<p>Identifying as a ‘”science person” might also help other groups currently underrepresented in STEM. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220936480">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin </em>suggests that a strong scientific identity can foster belonging and help first-generation and Black and minority ethnic university students feel more at home in the classroom.</p>
<p><span id="more-40021"></span>Susie Chen from the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues first looked at whether science identification was predictive of academic performance. On the night before an exam, 368 students enrolled in an Introductory Biology course were emailed a survey asking how much they agreed with statements including “I am a science person”. The team also looked at participants’ course grade and general academic history.</p>
<p>Results confirmed that those who identified more as a science person achieved higher grades. But the impact of science identification was greater for minority (Black and minority ethnic and first generation) students: the grade difference between students with a low and high science identification was larger in that group than among White, continuing-generation students.</p>
<p>A second study looked at whether science identification was related to better grades because it fostered students’ sense of belonging. At the start of the term, a teacher asked students in the Introductory Biology course to form groups of three to five people based on some similarity, such as living in the same halls.</p>
<p>Those in the belonging condition then wrote for ten minutes about difficulties they were experiencing in the transition from school to university, and were given three quotes from other students addressing the same concerns and reminding participants that initial difficulties tend to be temporary and not an obstacle to belonging at university. Teams then discussed similarities and differences between their experiences.</p>
<p>In the control condition, students took part in regular ice-breaking activities including drawing a mascot and choosing a biology-themed team name. Finally, science identification and belonging were both measured again.</p>
<p>Again, science identification was more predictive of course outcomes for minority students than majority students. But the belonging manipulation had an effect too. Course outcomes for minority students in the social belonging condition were no longer dependent on science identification. This suggests that science ID does in fact invoke a sense of belonging that helps students perform well in class, and that other ways of fostering that sense of belonging can buffer against the negative effects of having a low science identification.</p>
<p>Why does the intervention work? The authors suggest it’s because minority students may suffer from a lack of belonging due to stereotypes about what a scientist looks like: they might feel they don’t fit that profile. For example, previous research has found that minority groups are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">more likely to experience imposter syndrome</a> — and that that can have a negative impact on levels of achievement, engagement, attendance and performance.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many reasons minority students might not feel like they belong, including institutional racism or other discrimination, so looking more closely at <em>why</em> students don’t feel they fit in or identify with their chosen topic could be helpful in developing more robust solutions. Future research could also look at intersectionality — how different backgrounds or identities work together to influence sense of belonging, science identification or other factors.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/person-409127_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Loneliness across life phases</strong></p>
<p>During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.</p>
<p>Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.</p>
<p>So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to deal with loneliness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness</p></blockquote>
<p>If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>We tend to see ourselves as better than our peers across a whole range of traits and skills. We think we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/23/most-of-us-think-were-more-environmentally-friendly-than-our-peers/">more environmentally friendly</a>,  <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">morally superior</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/introducing-the-invisibility-cloak-illusion-we-think-were-more-observant-and-less-observed-than-everyone-else/">more observant</a> than those around us. The bias can even spill over to our perceptions of our loved ones: we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">overestimate the intelligence of our romantic partners</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>But according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-29806-001">new study in <em>Psychology and Aging </em></a>there’s one domain where we don’t see ourselves as “better than average”: remembering other people’s names.</p>
<p><span id="more-40015"></span></p>
<p>Past work has shown that the better-than-average effect is less likely to occur for tasks that are particularly challenging. Given that older adults experience more memory difficulties, perhaps they would be less likely to believe that their memory abilities are better-than-average than younger people, reasoned the researchers, led by Mary Hargis at Texas Christian University</p>
<p>To see whether this was the case, the team asked 84 participants aged 20-25 and 69 participants aged 60-84 to rate their own abilities and traits compared to others of the same age. Participants were asked about their ability to remember names, scientific terms, historical figures, and locations, as well as their perceptions of their own honesty, leadership ability, ability to get along with others, and capacity for hard work. For each of these skills and traits, participants rated themselves on a scale from 1 (much worse than others of the same age) to 9 (much better than others of the same age); a score of 5 indicated they thought they were average for their age.</p>
<p>Participants also rated how they believed someone would feel if they were to forget that person’s name — and how <em>they </em>would feel if someone else forgot their name.</p>
<p>The team found that the older adults rated themselves as significantly above average on all of the memory skills and traits — except for their ability to remember names. Younger participants also tended to rate themselves as above average, except for name memory, and memory for history and locations.</p>
<p>The fact that both younger and older adults failed to show a better-than-average effect suggests that the pattern of results can’t simply be attributed to memory difficulties that come with age.  Instead, we may come to believe that our name memory is no better than that of our peers because errors involving forgetting people’s names are particularly salient and embarrassing: most of us can probably recall an awkward exchange where we forgot someone’s name.</p>
<p>Highlighting just how excruciating that experience can be, participants generally indicated that forgetting someone else’s name would be a more negative experience than someone forgetting their name.  In fact, for older adults at least, those who showed greater embarrassment at forgetting someone else’s name, compared to having their own name forgotten, tended to rate their name memory as worse.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why younger adults also failed to show a better-than-average effect for history and location memory, though the authors speculate that a similar process could be at work: perhaps failures of these kinds of memory are more prominent for younger people (if they did poorly in a history exam, for instance).</p>
<p>Of course, the usual caveats apply here: the sample size was pretty small and in this case limited to just younger and older adults, so the study can’t say much about how other age groups might view their memory abilities. Plus, statistically speaking, failing to find a significant effect is not quite the same as proving that there is no effect. So it will be interesting to see whether these effects (or lack thereof) are replicated in further work.</p>
<p>Still, the study raises the intriguing possibility that we may have a more realistic view of our skills when our failures have negative social consequences. “Perhaps if we perceive our memory errors to occur while others are paying attention … we create a more accurate representation of our memory’s fallibility and are less likely to be overconfident in our abilities,” the authors conclude.</p>

<p>For nearly 30 years, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> has served the public and research communities by providing open access to scholarly articles, from the vast branches of physics to the many subdisciplines of computer science to everything in between, including math, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology, and economics.</p>
<p>The sheer number of arXiv research papers is both beneficial and challenging. Whether it’s a graduate student ramping up in her respective field, an established professor delving into adjacent ones, or researchers searching for big picture insights for the public good, this rich corpus of information offers significant, but sometimes overwhelming, depth.</p>
<p>To help make the arXiv more accessible, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">we present a free, open pipeline on Kaggle to the machine-readable arXiv dataset: a repository of 1.7 million articles</a>, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more.</p>
<p>“Having the entire arXiv corpus on Kaggle grows the potential of arXiv articles immensely,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “By offering the dataset on Kaggle we go beyond what humans can learn by reading all these articles and we make the data and information behind arXiv available to the public in a machine-readable format.”</p>
<p>Kaggle is a destination for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking interesting datasets, public notebooks, and competitions. Researchers can utilize Kaggle’s extensive data exploration tools and easily share their relevant scripts and output with others.</p>
<p>“arXiv is more than a repository of articles, it’s a platform for knowledge sharing,” said Presani. “This requires constant innovation on how we present and interpret the knowledge we make available. Kaggle users can help push the limits of this innovation and it can be a new outlet for our community to collaborate.”</p>
<p>“With large data sets, there is generally an expectation that there are likely to be overlooked discoveries, connections, innovative tools or perspectives, which may lead to additional insights, not just in the original subject, but across other fields of study, enabling yet more discovery and innovation,” said Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director.</p>
<p><b>Call to Action</b></p>
<p>Our hope is to empower new use cases that can lead to the exploration of richer machine learning techniques that combine multi-modal features towards applications like trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, co-citation networks, knowledge graph construction, and semantic search interfaces.</p>
<p>An example of such a semantic search application built on top of a specific corpus would be <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/an-nlu-powered-tool-to-explore-covid-19.html">Google’s COVID-19 Research Explorer</a>, a tool that helps researchers pore through the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">CORD-19 dataset</a> – a repository of 190,000+ science articles on COVID-19. Interfaces built on datasets such as this leverage advanced NLU techniques to understand a user’s <i>intent</i> behind a query. Ultimately, this can enable more efficient research by surfacing relevant data and evidence to complex, scientific questions. We hope the release of the machine-readable arXiv dataset will inspire the creation of similar NLU tools over this new corpus.</p>
<p>Alex Alemi, Senior Research Scientist at Google, has also pursued more exciting applications of ML using the arXiv. As described in the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00075.pdf"><i>On the Use of arXiv as a Dataset</i></a> , Alex and his colleagues sought to propel the arXiv as a benchmark for large scale, multi-relational tasks, such as with graph neural networks.  “I’m excited to see the research community rise to the challenge of a rich, multifaceted dataset with so much real-world practicality, and the new questions this will raise,” says Alex.</p>
<p><b>Access</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">The dataset is now available on Kaggle</a> and will be updated weekly. Please send us your feedback and stay tuned for additional updates!</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/___ellie">Ellie Broughton</a></p>
<p>Research has shown that Black people are particularly like to be victims of “anger bias”, in which others incorrectly interpret their facial expressions as angry. Past studies have focused on adult faces — but now evidence shows that even young kids face such prejudice. A <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000756">new study</a> published in <em>Emotion</em> has found that teacher trainees more often misperceive primary-school-age Black children as being angry.<span id="more-40007"></span></p>
<p>The team, led by Amy Halberstadt at North Carolina State University, asked 178 prospective teachers from training programmes in the southeastern United States to complete an emotion recognition task. The participants saw video clips of 72 children, aged 9 to 13, making facial expressions depicting six emotions (happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, or disgusted). The kids were divided equally by race (Black, White) and gender.</p>
<p>The trainees were asked to supply their best judgment about the emotion depicted in each face. In the first set of trials they just saw the very beginning of an emotional expression, but later saw a more fully created expression.</p>
<p>The team then assessed trainees’ implicit bias via the child race Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit bias via a questionnaire (REACT) which asked participants to rate their agreement with prejudiced statements about how race affects student behaviour, such as “Black students don’t study very much”. (Although the IAT has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">previously been criticised</a> as a measure of “implicit” attitudes, the main findings of the new study don’t rely on this measure).</p>
<p>Teachers had fair accuracy at detecting emotions, but in both White and Black children, boys were more often misread as looking angry when showing other facial expressions. (The sample of teachers, which reflects typical trends in the profession, was 89% female).</p>
<p>As predicted, Black boys were misperceived as angry more often than White boys, and Black girls were more often misperceived as angry than White girls. Surprisingly, higher levels of bias (implicit or explicit) did not actually increase the likelihood that Black children would face anger bias, but instead decreased the likelihood that teachers would misperceive White children to be angry.</p>
<p>The authors hypothesise that for the trainees, understanding children’s emotions “may intersect with the racial biases teachers have acquired through living in a culture in which racial stereotypes are well-embedded”, leading them to mistake Black children as angry when they’re not.</p>
<p>This could have two significant consequences, they write. Misperceived anger that leads to a teacher punishing a child can disrupt their education, while anger is also “emotionally contagious” so could lead to a teacher becoming angry themselves.</p>
<p>The research adds to some other studies which have also found evidence of racial biases in teachers. A previous US study, for example, found that in an early years classroom <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/zigler/publications/Preschool%20Implicit%20Bias%20Policy%20Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379_v1.pdf">teachers gazed longer at Black children</a>, especially Black boys, while looking for “challenging behaviors”.</p>
<p>Halberstadt says she hopes this research will ultimately help to develop better interventions to combat racialised biases. “Racialised bias is known to every Black family in the United States. When I talk with colleagues and friends, groups and families, people nod their heads: ‘Yes, we know this. What’s new?’” This study was designed to demonstrate the existence of this bias to White people and other researchers, she explains.</p>
<p>She’s also keen to expose other racial prejudices besides the anger bias: “We want to keep our eyes and ears open to what other phenomena are being imposed by … culture and by White people on others because of stereotypes. So the next question is, ‘ What are other biases that we have that we haven’t become aware of?’”</p>
<p>In the UK, researchers from the Centre For Education and Youth (CFEY) <a href="https://cfey.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LKMco-and-GLA-Boys-on-Track-FINAL-version-for-web.pdf">have found</a> that teachers in London show biases against Black Caribbean boys and White boys from poorer backgrounds. This affected not just disciplinary measures at school (for example, they were more likely to be expelled), but also assessment, such as which academic ability stream students were put in.</p>
<p>Ellie Mulcahy, head of research at CFEY, says the findings of Halberstadt’s study are very concerning: “While this is a US study, and more research is sorely needed in the UK context, we know that racial bias is a problem in the UK.” Currently, we have no idea how early in their education Black children in UK nurseries and schools encounter bias from teachers. Isn’t it time to find out?</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/lgbt-4115612_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Aging is a major risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases, which include diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and arthritis. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04188.x">More than half</a> of older adults in the US have <em>three or more</em> chronic diseases. Having multiple chronic diseases can increase the chances for disability, hospitalization, and death.</p>
<p>Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults are an under-served population that experience health disparities often related to a lifetime of stressors such as stigma, discrimination, and oppression. As such, this is a population with many barriers to receiving patient-centered health care. With aging, middle-aged and older LGB adults are therefore likely to be at risk not only for medical diseases, but also other chronic conditions.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>To examine chronic diseases in this population, we used data from the US <a href="https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm">National Survey of Drug Use and Health</a> to determine the extent of three chronic conditions: mental illness, unhealthy substance use, and having two or more medical diseases. We then looked at the presence of having more than one of these conditions among LGB adults age 50 and older. We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.</p>
<p>These results highlight the complex health needs of this population. It is important to recognize that while medical and public health interventions usually focus on one condition, this is often not appropriate for older adults with multiple chronic diseases. A patient-centered coordinated approach is needed that considers how each condition is interrelated with other coexisting diseases. Unhealthy substance use and mental illness for example can complicate the management of chronic medical diseases and lead to poorer health outcomes.</p>
<p>The care of older adults, especially for communities that are under-served, such as sexual minority populations, needs to involve patient-centered care that considers all chronic diseases and how they may be related. For older LGB adults we also need a greater awareness of all possible forms of stigma related to people such as older individuals and those of sexual minority status, and we must understand how this may impact health.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to not further stigmatize but to draw attention to the needs of older adults from communities who have been neglected and under-served so that they can receive better care through improved awareness of the multiple factors that affect health and well-being.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>There will always be some people within a group who are more confident than others. But some groups as a whole tend towards modesty — as with the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kung-San-Women-Foraging-Society/dp/0521295610">!Kung hunters of the Kalahari Desert</a>, for example, who deliberately downplay their own achievements and efforts. However, the opposite can also occur — and widespread overconfidence can of course become a problem, as with the US energy company Enron, whose <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790902726665?journalCode=fbsh20">“culture of arrogance”</a> ultimately led to its downfall.</p>
<p>These two examples are highlighted in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45451-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, which reveals a route by which a bias towards overconfidence can develop. In their paper, Joey T Cheng at York University and colleagues first propose and then provide evidence for the idea that if we’re exposed to people who are overconfident, this rubs off on us. In other words, we calibrate our self-assessments based on the confidence level of those around us. Overconfidence can, then, be transmitted socially — and this could help to explain how groups, teams and organisations form their own, sometimes drastically different, confidence norms.</p>
<p><span id="more-40004"></span></p>
<p>The team ran a series of six studies to explore all this. In the first study, involving 104 participants, pairs of previously unacquainted students were put to work, first individually and then together, on a lab task. The task involved guessing the personality traits of 10 people from photographs. After completing the task both times, each participant ranked themselves according to how well they’d thought they’d done, relative to everyone else in the group. The team found that working with someone who’d over-ranked their own performance rubbed off on the other member of the pair — after the joint task, they became more confident in their own ability. (This happened though neither member knew what the other’s self-ranking had been.)</p>
<p>As the researchers write, “after working together, initially non-similar strangers became more similar to each other in terms of over-placement, suggesting the convergence of over-confidence.”</p>
<p>The subsequent five studies explored this effect further experimentally. A study that involved asking participants to guess the weights of people from photographs revealed that overconfidence (or in this study, at least, reduced under-confidence) can be transmitted indirectly, from person to person to person, “highlighting the extensive reach of confident peers”. (In this study, participants were indirectly influenced by a fictitious former partner of their own partner in the weight-guessing task.)</p>
<p>Further work revealed that these confidence effects can persist, still being evident several days later. Importantly, two of the studies produced evidence that the influence of overconfident peers on a participant’s own self-estimations happened largely outside their conscious awareness. As the team writes, if you’re unaware of such a “stealthy” transmission of bias, this could make it harder to resist.</p>
<p>The work also reveals one important qualifier to all these effects: overconfidence transmission occurs only within <em>in</em>-groups. In this case, student participants were influenced by the responses of “partners” who were identified as attending the same university, but not by responses from people identified as coming from a rival university sports team, for example. “That is, individuals do not copy indiscriminately”, the team writes. “Instead they are sensitive to whose mental representations are on display and selectively acquire the over-placement of in-group but not out-group members.” This is consistent with theories about cultural learning.</p>
<p>However, as the researchers themselves point out, these studies focused on over-placement as one form of overconfidence. More work will be needed to investigate whether this kind of social transmission occurs for other forms, such as over-estimation, which relates strictly to your stand-alone performance — the belief that you did better than you actually did in a test, for example. Similarly, it’s not yet clear whether it applies to over-precision (being<em> convinced</em> that you scored at least 80 per cent, for example, when you didn’t.)</p>
<p>Still, the work does contribute to our understanding of how an atmosphere of overconfidence (in the form of over-placement, at least) develops.</p>
<p>The theory doesn’t negate the possibility that there are also cultural effects relevant to overestimation. For example, the researchers write, in the US, the most individualistic society in the world, unusually high levels of overconfidence might be triggered by cultural cues that emphasise success and self-sufficiency — and as those cultural values spread between people, so too can over-confidence.</p>
<p>However, the work still suggests that overconfident beliefs among a few may lead to a cascade-like spread of biased beliefs through a social group, team, or society. A recognition that this happens, will surely be important for all kinds of organisations.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/cure-1006810_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics</strong></p>
<p>Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s, there have been over 150 antibacterial drugs developed and marketed for human or veterinary use. The effect these drugs have had on infectious diseases and population health is remarkable. A once considered serious bacterial infection can now be successfully managed using antibiotics prescribed from the doctor. This was not always the case, as our grandparents may testify: bacterial infections were often fatal and the choices available to manage such infections were limited.</p>
<blockquote><p>Doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>This “golden age” of discovery may, however, soon come to an end, as more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to the antibiotics available to us. It is for this reason that healthcare organizations across the world have been focusing on developing stewardship policies to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics. In England, the situation is no different, and the Department of Health and Social Care have developed an antimicrobial resistance strategy. As part of the plan, doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so. As the majority of antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, healthcare providers working in this setting are set specific prescribing targets.</p>
<p>It is important to establish if the polices are working from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, but also that these polices are fair, and do not penalize communities in the most need of care. Our work aimed to address these questions. To do this, we used antibiotic prescribing data from the NHS, as well as working out the characteristics of the local areas in England using nationally available data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, we found that, in England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working: since 2014, antibiotic prescribing has reduced by around 14 per cent.  We also found that prescribing of certain classes of antibiotics, namely those considered broad spectrum, have also reduced.</p>
<p>When we considered local factors in our analysis, we showed that the most deprived areas of England had the highest levels of antibiotic prescribing.  When we adjusted for two long-term conditions – diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – both of which are associated with increased antibiotic use, we still found higher levels of antibiotic prescribing in the most deprived areas of England.  We also showed that geography was an important factor too: compared to London, all other areas of England had higher levels of antibiotic prescribing – with the East of England, and the North East of England having the highest levels.</p>
<p><strong>Considering local needs</strong></p>
<p>You might ask why this is important? Well, that’s a good question.  Our work shows that in addition to a national strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing, it is important to consider local needs too. People living in more deprived areas might, for example, might have greater health need for antibiotics compared to people living in more affluent areas.  National one-sized-fits all targets might not necessarily account for this. If there is greater antibiotic need in deprived areas, doctors working in these areas might be unfairly penalized for prescribing them.  This is not fair on the doctors working in primary care, but may also impact on patients too.</p>
<p>The antibiotic stewardship polices appear to be reducing overall antibiotic prescribing, which is a positive thing, although there is still significant variation in prescribing across England.  It would be appropriate for future prescribing targets to account for local factors to ensure the most deprived communities are not inappropriately penalized.</p>
<p>The bottom line is if someone is in medical need of an antibiotic, they should be prescribed it, regardless of the characteristics of their local area or where they live.</p>

<p>Rapid testing has been a powerful tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks around the world (see <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iceland</a>, <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch209004" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Germany</a>, …). While many countries support testing through government sponsored healthcare infrastructure, in the United States COVID-19 testing has largely been organized and provided by for-profit businesses. While financial incentives coupled with social commitment have motivated many scientists and engineers at companies and universities to work hard around the clock to facilitate testing, there are also many individuals who have succumbed to greed. Opportunism has bubbled to the surface and scams, swindles, rackets, misdirection and fraud abound. This is happening at a time when workplaces are in desperate need of testing, and demands for testing are likely to increase as schools, colleges and universities start opening up in the next month. Here are some examples of what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost there is your basic fraud. In July, a company called “Fillakit”, which had been <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus-contracts/contracts/70FB7020D00000029" rel="noopener" target="_blank">awarded a $10.5 million federal contract</a> to make COVID-19 test kits, was <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-ordered-10-2-million-in-covid-19-testing-kits-its-now-warning-states-not-to-use" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shipping unusable, contaminated, soda bottles</a>. This “business”, started by some law and real estate guy called <a href="https://kiowacountypress.net/content/closer-look-federal-covid-contractors-reveals-inexperience-fraud-accusations-and-weapons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paul Wexler, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-test-kit-maker-dissolves-amid-probes-11594153304" rel="noopener" target="_blank">went under two months after it launched</a> amidst a slew of investigations and complaints from former workers. Oh, BTW, <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87789" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michigan ordered 322,000 Fillakit tubes</a> which went straight to the trash (as a result they could not do a week worth of tests).</li>
<li>Not all fraud is large scale. Some former VP at now defunct “Cure Cannabis Solutions” ordered 100 COVID-19 test kits that do who-knows-what at a price of 50c a kit. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/feds-seize-100-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits-shipped-from-china-addressed-to-portland-man-with-prior-ties-to-cannabis-industry.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Feds seized it</a>. These kits, which were not FDA approved, were sourced from “Anhui DeepBlue Medical” in Hefei, China.</li>
<li>To be fair, the Cannabis guy was small fry. In Laredo Texas, some guy called Robert Castañeda received assistance from a <em>congressman</em> to purchase $500,000 of kits from the same place! Anhui DeepBlue Medical sent Castańeda 20,000 kits ($25 a test). Apparently <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/he-spent--500-000-to-buy-coronavirus-tests-health-officials-say-theyre-unreliable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the tests had 20% accuracy.</a> To his credit, the Cannabis guy paid 1/50th the price for this junk.</li>
<li>Let’s not forget who is really raking in the bucks though. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the primary testing outfits in the US right now; each is processing around 150,000 tests a day. These are for-profit companies and indeed they are making a profit. The economics is simple: insurance companies reimburse LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics for the tests. The rates are basically determined by the amount that Medicare will pay, i.e. the government price point. Intiially, the reimbursement was set at $51, and well… at that price LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics just <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/30/coronavirus-testing-stunted-low-medicare-reimbursement/3048943001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weren’t that interested</a>. I mean, people have to put food on the table, right? (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=205179230701958" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adam Schechter</a>, CEO of LabCorp makes $4.9 million a year; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=241018100270891" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve Rusckowski</a>, CEO of Quest Diagnostics, makes $9.9 million a year). So the Medicare reimbursement rate was raised to $100. The thing is, LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics get paid regardless of how long it takes to return test results. <a href="https://abc7.com/coronavirus-los-angeles-california-testing-long-wait-for-covid-19/6341394/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Some people are currently waiting 15 days to get results</a> (narrator: such tests results are useless).</li>
<li>Perhaps a silver lining lies in the stock price of these companies. The title of this post is “$ How to Profit From COVID-19 Testing $”. I guess being able to take a week or two to return a test result and still get paid $100 for something that cost $30 lifts the stock price… and you can profit!<img alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM" class=" size-full wp-image-14474 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="14474" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png" data-orig-size="2496,1326" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-03-23-am/" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490" /></li>

One of the tech executives pushing the initiative, called <a href="https://www.testutah.com/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TestUtah</a>, was a 37-year old founder (of Nomi Health) by the name of Mark Newman. He admitted that “none of us knew anything about lab testing at the start of the effort”. Didn’t stop Newman et al. from signing more than $50 million in agreements with several states to provide testing. tl;dr: the tests had a poor limit of detection, samples were mishandled, throughput was much lower than promised etc. etc. and as a result they weren’t finding positive cases at rates similar to other testing facilities. The significance is summarized poignantly in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New Yorker piece about the debacle</a>:<br />
<blockquote><p>“I might be sick, but I want to go see my grandma, who’s ninety-five. So I go to a TestUtah site, and I get tested. TestUtah tells me I’m negative. I go see grandma, and she gets sick from me because my result was wrong, because TestUtah ran an unvalidated test.”</p></blockquote>
<p>P.S. There has been <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/utah-adds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a disturbing TestUtah hydroxycholorquine story going on behind the scenes</a>. I include this fact because no post on fraud and COVID-19 would be complete without a mention of hydroxycholoroquine.</p></li>
<li>Maybe though, the tech bros will save the day. The recently launched <a href="https://xprize.org/prizes/covidtesting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$5 million COVID-19 X-prize</a> is supposed to incentivize the development of “Frequent. Fast. Cheap. Easy.” COVID-19 testing. The goal is nothing less than to “radically change the world.” I’m hopeful, but I just hope they don’t <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/10-million-genomics-x-prize-canceled-outpaced-innovation-8C10990757" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancel it like they did the genome prize</a>. After all, their goal of “500 tests per week with 12 hour turnaround from sample to result” is likely to be outpaced by innovation just like what happened with genome sequencing. So in terms of making money from COVID-19 testing don’t hold your breath with this prize.</li>
<li>As is evident from the examples above, one of the obstacles to quick riches with COVID-19 testing in the USA is the FDA. The thing about COVID-19 testing is that lying to the FDA on applications, or providing unauthorized tests, can lead to unpleasantries, e.g. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jail</a>. So some play it straight and narrow. Consider, for example, <a href="https://seqonce.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SeqOnce</a>, which has developed the <a href="https://seqonce.com/azureseq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Azureseq SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit</a>. These guys have an “EUA-FDA validated test”: <img alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14476" data-attachment-id="14476" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png" data-orig-size="2336,2130" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-14-45-am/" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490" /><br />
This is exactly what you want! You can click on “Order Now” and pay $3,000 for a kit that can be used to test several hundred samples (great price!) and the site has all the necessary information: IFUs (these are “instructions for use” that come with FDA authorized tests), validation results etc. If you look carefully you’ll see that administration of the test requires FDA approval. The company is upfront about this. Except the test is not FDA authorized; this is easy to confirm by examining <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the FDA Coronavirus EUA site</a>. One can infer from a <a href="https://seqonce.com/seqonce-biosciences-launches-azureseq-one-step-universal-sars-cov-2-rt-qpcr-kit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> that they have <em>submitted</em> an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) but while they claim it has been <em>validated</em>, nowhere does it say it has been <em>authorized.</em>Clever eh? <em>Authorized,</em> <em>validated, authorized, validated, authorized, .. </em>and here I was just about to spend $3,000 for a bunch of tests that cannot be currently legally administered. <strong>Whew</strong>!At least this is not fraud. Maybe it’s better called… I don’t know… a game? Other companies are playing similar games. <a href="https://www.concentricbyginkgo.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gingko Bioworks is advertising “testing at scale, supporting schools and businesses” with an “Easy to use FDA-authorized test”</a> but again this seems to be a product that has “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-06-19/ginkgo-bioworks-ceo-on-new-covid-19-testing-initiative-video" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched</a>“, not one that, you know, actually exists; I could find no Gingko Bioworks test that works at scale that is authorized on the FDA Coronavirus EUA website, and it turns out that what they mean by FDA authorized is <a href="https://twitter.com/jrkelly/status/1273704377665101838?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an RT-PCR test that they have outsourced to others</a>.  Fingers crossed though- maybe the marketing helped CEO Jason Kelly <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/28/business/ginkgo-raises-70-million-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-employers-universities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raise the $70 million</a> his company has received for the effort; I certainly hope it works (soon)!</li>
<li>By the way, I mentioned that the SeqOnce operation is a bunch of “guys”. I meant this literally; this is their “team”:<br />

Just one sec… <strong>what is up with biotech startups and 100% men leadership teams? </strong>See <a href="http://www.epinomics.co/team-bios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epinomics</a>, <a href="http://www.insightgenetics.com/about/management-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Insight Genetics</a>, <a href="https://oceangenomics.com/team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ocean Genomics</a>, <a href="https://www.kailosgenetics.com/our-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kailos Genetics</a>, <a href="https://circulogene.com/leadership-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Circulogene</a>, etc. etc.)… And what’s up with the black and white thing? Is that to try to hide that there are no people of color?<br />
I mention the 100% male team because if you look at all the people mentioned in this post, all of them are guys (except the person in the next sentence), and I didn’t plan that, it just how it worked out. Look, I’m not casting shade on the former CEO of Theranos. I’m just saying that there is a strong correlation here.<p></p>
<p>Sorry, back to the regular programming…</p></li>
<li>Speaking of swindlers and scammers, this post would not be complete without a mention of the COVID-19 testing czar, Jared Kushner. His secret testing plan for the United States went “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air" rel="noopener" target="_blank">poof into thin air</a>“! I felt that the 1 million contaminated and unusable Chinese test kits that he ordered for <em>$52 million</em> deserved the final mention in this post. Sadly, these failed kits appear to be the main thrust of the federal response to COVID-19 testing needs so far, and consistent with Trump’s recent call to, “slow the testing down” (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/donald-trump-testing-slow-down-response/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he wasn’t kidding</a>). Let’s see what turns up today at the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110912?s=1&amp;r=50" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hearings of the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus</a>, whose agenda is “The Urgent Need for a National Plan to Contain the Coronavirus”.</li>

When first introduced, the attraction of the Big Deal was immediately obvious, since it allows a library to buy its faculty access to most, if not all, of a publisher’s journals at a much lower “cost per article” (discounted) rate. From the start, however, there were doubters.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i></i></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1024/ShannonPritting.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="170" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/w256-h170/ShannonPritting.jpg" width="256" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Shannon Pritting<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In 2001, the Director of Libraries at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Kenneth Frazier, </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/frazier/03frazier.html"><i><span lang="EN-GB">warned</span></i></a></span><i><span> the library community of the dangers of signing big deals, or any comprehensive licensing agreement, with commercial publishers.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>“The current generation of library directors is engaged in a dangerous ‘game’ in which short-term institutional benefits are achieved at the long-term expense of the academic community,” he warned, adding that big deals would weaken libraries’ ability to manage their journal collections, foist on them journals they “neither need nor want” and increase their dependence on publishers “who have already shown their determination to monopolize the information marketplace.”</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Nevertheless, many libraries did sign big deals. And many later regretted it, not least because, having done so, they felt they had no choice but to keep renewing the contract, even as the cost kept going up and devoured more and more of their budget. </span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Libraries felt trapped, conscious that if they did not renew they would have to go back to subscribing to individual journals at list price, which would mean being able to afford access to fewer journals, and fearful that when they discovered that journals they wanted were no longer available, faculty would revolt.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Over time, however, a </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/05/01/wolf-finally-arrives-big-deal-cancelations-north-american-libraries/"><i><span lang="EN-GB">greater willingness</span></i></a></span><i><span> to think the unthinkable emerged, and some libraries began to cancel their big deals. And when they did so the sky did not fall in – which allowed other libraries to take heart.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>The list maintained </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0"><i><span lang="EN-GB">here</span></i></a></span><i><span> suggests that libraries began cancelling their big deals as long ago as 2008, but the number doing so has been accelerating in the last few years. What has really focussed minds are the recent decisions by both the </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x"><i><span lang="EN-GB">University of California</span></i></a></span><i><span> and </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611#.XuJLLWKW_k0.twitter"><i><span lang="EN-GB">MIT</span></i></a></span><i><span> to walk away from their negotiations with Elsevier rather than renew their big deals.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>But it is not necessary to walk away completely in the way UC and MIT have done. Instead, libraries can “unbundle” their Big Deal by replacing the large package of several thousand journals they are subscribed to with a small à la carte bundle of a few hundred journals, and in the process save themselves a great deal of money.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>What is helping libraries to make the decision to unbundle is the knowledge that more and more research is becoming available on an open access basis. In addition, new tools like </span></i><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://unsub.org/"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Unsub</span></i></a></span><i><span> are available to advise them on which journals they can cancel without too great an impact, and which journals are essential and so should be retained. </span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Given the big savings that can be realised, and the pressure library budgets are under, unbundling is expected to grow, particularly in light of the straitened circumstances that libraries will find themselves in after </span></i><i><span>the pandemic.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>This year a number of US universities have unbundled in favour of smaller packages of journals, including </span></i><span><i><a href="https://library.unc.edu/2020/04/upcoming-elsevier-cancellations/">UNC Chapel Hill</a>, <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.lib.iastate.edu/elsevier&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">Iowa State University</a> and the State University of New York (<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://slcny.libguides.com/slc/elsevier2020update&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">SUNY</a>) -- a system of 64 institutions. Coming in the wake of UC</i></span><i><span lang="EN-US">’s</span></i><i> decision to walk away from Elsevier these </i><i><span>“</span></i><i>little deals</i><i><span>”</span></i><i> have attracted a lot of attention. </i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In Europe, by contrast, there is a </span></i><span><i><a href="https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/">greater focus</a> right no on signing <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">transformative agreements</a>. In addition to providing reading rights, these new-style big deals include prepaid publishing rights to allow faculty to publish their articles on an open access basis. Amongst other things, these deals help assuage concerns about <a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/&quot;}" href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">double dipping</a> (where a university may end up paying both article-processing charges and subscriptions for the same journals). </i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>So how is a decision to unbundle made, and what are the issues and implications of making the decision? To get a clearer picture I spoke recently by email with Shannon Pritting, Shared Library Services Platform Project Director at SUNY. In April, SUNY replaced its Big Deal of 2,200 journals with Elsevier with a “little deal” of just 248 journals. By doing so, it says, it has saved about $7 million.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Unbundling raises a lot of questions, and I suspect we may not have answers to all of the questions for some time.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>For instance, as more and more universities unbundle, how accurate will the calculations informing the decisions about which journals to give up and which to keep prove to be over time? This could have implications for, amongst other things, how much of the money that has been saved will need to be spent on obtaining paywalled articles through Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and document delivery services.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Moreover, since unbundling </span></i><span><i><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0">appears</a> currently to be mainly a US thing (with Europe favouring transformative agreements) might we see a geographical divide emerge? If we do, what might the implications of this be, especially for the open access movement?</i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>In addition, might unbundling encourage more researchers to use illegal services like Sci-Hub, and might unbundling see university libraries marginalised to some extent, especially if they do not play an active role in funding open access?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Please read on for the interview. </span></i></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span><br /></span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: SUNY consists of 64 campuses I believe.

Of the papers SUNY researchers can access under the new arrangement, the calculation was that 30% of the papers that faculty are likely to need access to are available open access and, thanks to a post-termination agreement (PTA) with Elsevier, 25% will remain freely available to faculty from Elsevier. This does not imply that 45% will need to be ordered via document delivery services right?</span></i></b></h3><div><b><i><span><br /></span></i></b></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>SUNY partnered with Unsub (at the time Unpaywall Journals) to model costs and access options if we decided to cancel or unbundle our Elsevier Big Deal. The percentage you mention of 45% of content not being immediately accessible isn’t something that the Unsub data generally provided as a data point. Although the Unsub data varied by journal, the percentage that wouldn’t be immediately accessible was typically below 20%.</span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Although there was a lot of scepticism about the reliability of Unsub data and modelling in predicting costs post-cancellation, the tool and services helped us to think critically about all other data we were using to determine value. In the end, most SUNYs found that Unsub data was useful, and as reliable as other sources that we were using to determine the value of a big deal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Certainly, Post-Termination Access helps with providing immediate access. However, I don’t think that any campus expects that either 45% or 20% of the usage would translate into document delivery purchases. Everyone understands that journal usage data is inflated, flawed, and doesn’t reflect true usage and value. Yet, most forecasts of costs after cancellation or unbundling are based on vendor provided usage data.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>So we expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing the Big Deal to a smaller, focused package. And, if libraries find that users are requesting via ILL or document delivery a high amount of articles from any specific journal, they can always subscribe to a single journal if it’s cost effective.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Overall, the strategy was that the big deal provides access to a lot of content, but our big deal wasn’t an effective use of our money; it was worth it to see what actually happens after we changed our subscription.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>And, I expect that we’ll see the same trends and results that other consortia and libraries have seen: a cancellation of a big deal doesn’t lead to resulting increased costs for article purchasing or ILL that is anywhere near what a subscription to that large set of journals costs. Most users will find alternative sources as the user usually doesn’t need a specific article, but just needs an article that is relevant to the topic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>In the end, SUNY’s decision was based on the simple equation of whether 2,200 journals was worth the amount we were paying for the Big Deal, and not the fear of what the costs would be for guaranteeing the same type of access to the 2,200 journals as we had when we subscribed to the bundle.  Just as important as determining whether we could provide access to papers we would lose from the bundled titles was determining how many of these 2,200 journals we needed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>This work took just as much time or more than cost modelling. It involved outreach by many librarians with faculty and administration across SUNY. SUNY also hosted several coordinated open forums with faculty about the Elsevier deal, and engaged with Faculty governance and administration at the system and campus levels. Certainly usage data informed the journals we targeted for the 248, but equally important was input from our user community that was led by librarians.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We certainly had to walk through various data-driven scenarios of costs after cancellation, value of the package based on usage (and what journals were most important) to ensure we were gathering input and managing the change that comes from moving away from a Big Deal. But, the decision for SUNY was based on whether we valued the journals enough to pay the amount the vendor required us to pay to maintain that access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>In the end, it wasn’t in the best interests of SUNY to continue with the Big Deal.</span><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Individual title subscriptions</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: As you indicate, </span></i></b><b><i><span>the Elsevier unbundled deal assumes that any campus or department that needs access to journals not in the smaller bundle can subscribe separately.

This funding would be coming from the individual library budget, and would be funded with savings from the difference between what the library would have contributed to the previous big deal and the smaller 248 title deal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>There have been very few individual title subscriptions for Elsevier titles that were lost in the change to the smaller unbundled deal. The global pandemic began to impact the US just after the new unbundled deal was finalized, which resulted in libraries immediately beginning to limit spending, and then begin to cut budgets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>The savings from the change from the Big Deal to an unbundled deal provided campuses with the ability to weather drastic cuts, and many used the savings to help meet the need to quickly cut spending and budgets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Presumably the figure of 25% of articles that will be freely available as a result of the PTA with Elsevier will grow over time, in line with the number of new papers published in Elsevier journals that are not covered by the PTA?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>There will be some growth in the percentage of content that our users may want, but don’t have immediate access to as our Post Termination access grows less current. However, the percent increase and the costs of access will not be enough of a percentage to come close to the difference in what our previous deal cost our institutions, and what our current subscription will cost.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY would prefer to look at the aggregate savings built by the years it will take for our PTA to age as a major advantage to unbundling. In essence, as the industry shifts and more consortia and large libraries break subscriptions, the market for journal access will only be more advantageous to the subscriber in the future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Thinking of growth over time in the amount of content that our users can’t access via PTA, or a subscription, assumes that the value of a subscription or journal package will only grow. It’s clear that the value of big deals is declining, so future deals should only be more advantageous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>If SUNY does find it more cost effective to enter into another big deal or “re-bundle” what it recently unbundled, future deals should be better than the deal we had, which was based on historical metrics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Of those papers that will be available open access how many do you estimate will be the Version of Record (VoR) and how many are likely to be self-archived versions – e.g. preprint, Authors Accepted Manuscript (AAM), or </span></i></b><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/research/open-access/open-access-and-the-ref/understanding-versions-of-your-paper/%5d"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">some other version</span></i></b></a></span><b><i><span> that is not the VoR?

How do you expect those figures to change going forward?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP:</span></b><span>Our primary vendor for document delivery is Reprints Desk. A few institutions also use Copyright Clearance Center’s “Get it Now” service, but this is only for a small percentage of the document delivery volume. SUNY Libraries use the lowest cost vendor for document delivery, and for all but a few percent of articles, Reprints Desk is the lowest cost option.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Based on 5 years of ILL data (2015-19) SUNY has 300,000 total ILL requests per year (both lending and borrowing) for books and articles. Considering that half of ILL requests are for articles, and half of the requests are lending, about 100,000 requests are for ILL articles per year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Over this five-year span, total ILL volume has decreased a few percent per year. I expect that the total volume of ILL will continue to decrease, especially for articles. Every consortium that has cancelled big deals has found that there has been little impact on overall ILL volume.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Of the 100,000 articles requested in SUNY each year, about 25% are for content published within the last five years, which has the potential to incur costs for access. ILL departments are already doing a fine job providing access to current content as a supplement or alternative to subscriptions, and will be a reliable source to provide access for any content that is needed but not available via subscription.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY libraries have regularly found that providing access to journals via ILL and document delivery is more cost effective than subscribing to journals that have high subscription costs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY doesn’t currently have data on how many document delivery purchases are made per year, but we are working with our primary document delivery provider to gather this data to use as another point of consideration when we consider access options.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Do you have any sense of how much SUNY libraries generally pay for document delivery and ILL services each year?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>The amount that SUNY pays for document delivery and ILL services each year varies between institutions. Typically, smaller institutions don’t pay for document delivery, with our largest few institutions paying from $50,000 to $100,000. But we don’t currently have reliable detailed data on this document delivery spending in aggregate across our 60 institutions as each campus pays separately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Although our campuses will continue to decrease the amount of content such as journals that they license, we expect to see only a slight increase in document delivery costs. Users typically find alternative paths to journal articles if libraries don’t subscribe, whether it’s open access or alternative versions of a paper.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Document delivery is used only in limited circumstances, and we expect the percentage of articles that are available without a subscription to continue to increase. Most of the SUNYs also have enabled Unpaywall integration in their link resolvers, so open access is provided as an option whenever possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: </span></i></b><b><i><span>I understand it costs between $35 and $40 per article to order via Reprints Desk.

Does that sound about right?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>We have reasonably reliable data about the number of transactions where campuses have paid copyright (which in this case includes purchasing the article from a document delivery provider) and the number is 16,250 per year. Your estimate of $35-$40 per article is fair, so our document delivery and copyright spending would be roughly $568,750 dollars per year. However, some of the heaviest requested publications such as Nature, and even Elsevier publications, cost less than $25 per article.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We think that there is a fair amount of open access that gets purchased or requested via ILL, especially in hybrid journals. This is why we’re excited that Reprints Desk has an open access filter that some libraries are using. As you’re likely aware, finding open access in hybrid publications is often not easy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Using your estimate of $8-10 per article for ILL, which I find reasonable, you’re correct that the spending on ILL for articles ordered from other libraries via resource sharing would be around $670,000 per year.  SUNY continues to try to minimize this cost by assessing costs of resource sharing systems and networks to ensure that we’re getting our best value for the resource sharing we need to serve our users.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>When we were using the Unsub post-cancellation cost modelling tool, they defaulted to $17 per request based on older estimates from ILL literature. Even with this higher ILL estimate, the model still indicated that most of our campuses should subscribe to only a small group of journals.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><i><span>RP: Ok, so as a rough estimate we can say that SUNY Libraries are receiving about 100,000 article requests a year from faculty. Of these about 16,250 will be supplied via document delivery services (at a cost of around $568,750) and some 83,750 will be supplied via ILL (at a cost of about $670,000). So the total cost of fulfilling individual article requests will be around $1.238 million a year. </span></i></b><b><i><span>Does SUNY operate a mediated document delivery service, or can faculty go online and order documents without the library needing to be involved?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>Some SUNY institutions provide an unmediated document delivery service, typically facilitated through an ILL workflow.

As many STEM publishers use metrics that utilize types and level of programs for subscription rates, document delivery is an attractive option to provide access to resources as subscription costs are often beyond the ability of these small campuses to afford.</span><span> </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-size: x-large;">Illegal services and big deals</span></span></h3><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: You say you </span></i></b><b><i><span>expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing from a big deal to a smaller deal because “Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.” Is there any concern that by unbundling the library could encourage users to access illegal services like Sci-Hub?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>SP: </span></b><span>Certainly, SUNY values the work that publishers do, including Elsevier. SUNY wishes to continue its relationship with Elsevier moving forward, as we’ll continue for multiple years to have at least a group of 248 titles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>However, I think what unbundling does is focus the review not purely on cost per use, which inflates the value of a subscription.

So, with content they do not have access to they may come to a record but never take the next step of ordering the article via ILL.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>We realize that the best case scenario for everyone would be that bundles of the highest quality content were available at prices that were slowly decreasing to acknowledge that the cost of IT infrastructure is going down, so journal hosting prices should go down. But, that’s not the offers that are typically coming from publishers. Library budgets, at least in SUNY, are declining, so increasing costs lead us to make tough decisions about which of the subscriptions to cut.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>The proposition that unbundling will lead to more use of illegal access and that this is a problem that the library or libraries should solve isn’t one that is fair to libraries. It’s not that libraries are seeking to offer less content to their users; they just can’t afford increasing prices.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>We hope that, instead of illegal services becoming more common open access and open science becomes more prevalent and shifts the readership models to open access rather than Sci-Hub or models that aren’t connected to legitimate organizations.</span><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><i><span>RP: How many big deals does SUNY currently have and with whom?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>SP:</span></b><span> SUNY is not a consortium that has historically collaborated on big deals for content.

At this point, it seems unlikely that SUNY would enter into any large-scale transformative agreements in the near future.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>The culture and organizational structure of SUNY is such that individual authors have been paying open access fees. Although SUNY libraries are largely supportive of movements towards open such as open access and open educational resources, the financial implications of transformative agreements would be difficult for most SUNY libraries to justify.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>SUNY library budgets will continue to be negatively impacted, so the focus will likely be on getting the most relevant access over the next 3-5 years. However, SUNY will continue to ask for terms and discounts for publishing open access as much as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><span>When a commitment to dedicate funds away from current access to supporting open access comes into play with negotiations, SUNY will likely continue to prioritize current access.

Why wouldn’t libraries see this not as a referendum on the value of the library, but as an indicator of how much the exact content they were subscribing to mattered. I realize things are always complex in these situations, but libraries shouldn’t tie up their value with keeping specific subscriptions. Libraries offer so much more than just access to articles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Regarding risking being marginalized if SUNY doesn’t focus on transformative agreements or continuing to find ways to subscribe to large journal packages: I agree that unbundling should signal a shift in how libraries focus on access. And, SUNY certainly isn’t against transformative agreements or subscribing to bundles of journals that make sense financially.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>However, focusing on licensing agreements with publishers as the main vehicle will likely lead to further issues in the future where libraries again cannot sustain the costs of the endeavours they’re focusing on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>SUNY will be focusing on ways we can help our system’s faculty and staff participate more in open access publishing to make their intellectual property and research more accessible to all.  We can be sure that publishers and vendors will be partners with us as we begin to move more into open access strategies. But, APCs and transformative agreements should be analysed in our overall context regarding increasing access for SUNY faculty, staff, and students and making the output of SUNY faculty, staff, and students more accessible to the larger community.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Certainly, ILL and availability of articles is something to be aware of, especially if more large subscription reductions and unbundling continue. ILL departments have seen staffing reductions, which has led to a focus on streamlining workflows, and has brought about a decade’s worth of focus in ILL (at least in the US) that has seen most of the innovation going towards automation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>What ILL has lacked is a large-scale investment in focusing on the larger ecosystem, which includes better terms in licensing and the ability to offer new services rather than just offering the same services more efficiently. But, I think there’s going to be a real shift in libraries moving more towards collections services, which includes ILL.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>For example, Princeton has adopted this model, which focuses on both access and collections. There needs to be better structural support for ILL, so that consortial coordination of collection and access for things like journals can happen. SUNY discussed all of this when we were considering unbundling, and although we focused for the past six months on showing libraries how to arrange and configure alternative access, we’re at a point now where we can focus on more structural issues that use multiple data points when making collection decisions or setting strategic directions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>This spirit has been strong in SUNY with coordinated collection development via resource sharing and demand driven acquisitions for books for some time, with many libraries seeking to diversify SUNY’s collection if a title isn’t available in SUNY.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>We’re hoping that we can coordinate journal access in a similar way, where we have programs where SUNYs cooperate on what journals they subscribe to in order to provide the best access to e-journals for all of SUNY.</span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span>Additionally, vendors will likely be offering more in the way of access options that allows consortia to blend ILL-like access and subscriptions.

People with poor to no visual imagery were more likely to choose a scientific or mathematical occupation. These categories are rather broad, however. For instance, “media” includes print media. And artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly do exist.<br /><br />The study had a number of limitations, e.g. washing out individual differences and relying on introspection for rating visual imagery ability (as noted by the authors). There are more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303581" target="_blank" title="binocular rivalry">objective ways</a> to test for imagery, but these involve in-person visits.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology/">Exploring hypothetical thinking</a></h4>

<p>What is hypothetical thinking? We do it continually. Consider making a decision, from choosing what to eat to choosing what to do about a dangerous disease. In deciding between options, you have to consider each of them, working out what’s likely to happen <em>if</em>  you take it, then compare the results. A natural human way to do that is by <em>imagining</em> taking the given option, and following through that scenario, still “offline” in imagination, but constrained by your background sense of reality. That sense includes innate or learned patterns of expectation about what will happen next, of how things and people in general tend to behave; it also includes your knowledge of your local environment and its particular inhabitants. It may be informed by modern science. Unfortunately, it may also be distorted by various sorts of prejudice and error. Still, we often have to rely on our ability to preview options hypothetically, because we cannot try them all before deciding. Choosing the right option first time can be a matter of life or death.</p><p>Hypothetical thinking is used for theoretical purposes as well as practical ones. For example, when a mathematician wants to prove that every number with a property P also has a property Q, the most straightforward way to do it is by <em>supposing</em> that an unspecified number <em>x</em> has P, then proving from that hypothesis that <em>x</em> also has Q. For that shows that <em>if</em> <em>x</em> has P, <em>then x</em> has Q. Since <em>x</em> could be any number with P, the argument establishes that <em>every</em> number with P also has Q.</p><p>We can get more precise about what such cases have in common. They all involve a procedure for assessing conditional statements of the form “If X, then Y.” For instance, “X” could be “It rains” and “Y” “The match will be cancelled”, or “X” could be “I try to swim across the river” and “Y” “I’ll reach the other side.” The procedure is this. First, suppose X. Then, on that hypothesis, assess Y, using whatever background information is appropriate. Finally, whatever attitude you take to Y on the hypothesis X, take the <em>same</em> attitude unconditionally to “If X, then Y.” Thus, if you <em>accept</em> the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is slow, you are a strong swimmer), you unconditionally <em>accept</em> the conditional statement “If I try to swim the river, I’ll reach the other side.” But if you <em>reject</em> the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is fast, you are a weak swimmer), you unconditionally <em>reject</em> the conditional statement. We may call that procedure the <em>Suppositional Rule</em>. Although its explicit articulation in words is quite abstract, we implicitly use it in practice all the time. It comes so naturally to us that it may seem almost trivial.</p><p>What we fail to realize, in unreflectively applying the Suppositional Rule, is that it contains a hidden logical inconsistency. That can be proved in several different ways; <em>Suppose and Tell</em> has the details. Thus it cannot be 100% reliable. But that does not mean that it is completely useless. It works well enough for practical purposes in most ordinary applications. When restricted to acceptance on the basis of mathematical proof, it works perfectly. But the unrestricted rule, which we use in everyday life, subtly generates contradictions in some cases.</p><p>The Suppositional Rule is what psychologists call a <em>heuristic</em>, a way of answering questions of some kind which is quick and easy to use, but only imperfectly reliable. For example, when we are asked which personal names in a list are the most common, with no access to statistics, we may use their psychological accessibility as a heuristic, a guide to their frequency. In vision, we may use discontinuities in colour as a guide to the edges of solid objects; camouflage exploits the limitations of that heuristic.</p><p>The inconsistency of our heuristic for conditionals helps explain why logicians have had so much trouble understanding the meaning of conditional statements in natural languages. It was already a matter of controversy amongst the ancient Greeks, more than two thousand years ago. The poet Callimachus wrote: “Even the crows on the rooftops are cawing about the question ‘Which conditionals are true?’” It is just as hotly contested today amongst philosophers and linguists. The trouble was that we didn’t realize just what rule we were applying, so its inconsistency was unclear. This affected even the data on which discussion relied, which largely consisted of sample sentences classified as “correct” or “incorrect”—using the inconsistent heuristic!</p><p>How can such a logically flawed heuristic serve us so well in practice? As with other paradoxes uncovered by philosophers, in practice we can get a long way by backing off whenever we bump into a paradox, without trying to understand what it is we have stumbled across.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@thanospal?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Thanos Pal</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/exploring-hypothetical-thinking/">Exploring hypothetical thinking</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/631888840/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/631888840/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/english-idioms-about-family-life-and-conjugal-felicity/" rel="nofollow">English idioms about family life and conjugal felicity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/conjunction-dysfunction/" rel="nofollow">Conjunction dysfunction</a></li></ul> </div>

Jan van Deursen, together with his postdoc Bennett Childs, engaged a notorious German law firm against me. The former Mayo Clinic professor denies accusations of bullying and discrimination and obviously seeks to prevent his lab members from talking to the press. Hoecker Lawyers claim van Deursen resigned as pensioner on 24 July 2020, voluntarily.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FHwtiShXfjs/">Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></h4>

<p>The Black Lives Matter movement in the US and elsewhere has rightly brought about a much-needed reexamination of deeply rooted issues around diversity and equity for minorities and marginalized populations. Structural racism and other inequities, for example around gender or status, continue to affect academia world-wide. At PLOS we recognize that we can do better — our journals can and must play a role in addressing concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>



<p>These are not new concerns, and we have been working to make our journals a home for diverse voices. However, we recognize that we need to step up our efforts in a number of areas and commit to doing so. For our journals, this means:</p>



<ul><li>We will <strong>assess and survey the diversity of our contributors</strong>, from the thousands of Academic Editors handling submissions at our journals to our authors and reviewers. This will establish a baseline and allow us to hold ourselves accountable for making measurable positive changes. </li></ul>



<ul><li>We need to <strong>improve the diversity of our journals and their leadership</strong>. This includes our internal staff but also our Academic Editors appointed to senior roles. We need to ensure that our journals are representative of broader society as well as the academic community, and that the voices of different communities or groups of researchers are heard and play an integral role in our journals. We commit to proactively seeking out underrepresented communities to redress the balance.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We will continue our efforts to <strong>ensure that all manuscript handling processes are set up to recognize and minimize bias</strong>. We are reflecting internally on how we can improve our understanding of these issues and minimise any of our own biases, and will work with our Academic Editors and peer reviewers to address any form of bias against authors or their origin in the handling of submitted manuscripts. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Within the scope of each of our journals we <strong>aim to be a</strong> <strong>publishing platform for research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations</strong>. In doing so, we need to ensure that the study of these populations recognizes the problem of racism and inequalities, and that the topic is covered appropriately in published papers. We need to be mindful of inappropriate discussions of race in relationship with genetics traits for example. Inequalities and racism do affect the well-being of minority populations, and this needs to be considered in public health research settings as well.<br /></li><li>We have the obligation to continue to <strong>uphold the highest standards of ethics</strong>. Research about minorities or other affected populations needs to be conducted to the highest editorial standards and ethics guidelines, and should award credit to contributors from these communities as appropriate.  We will not publish research intended to directly support oppression or persecution. </li></ul>



<p>Some of these commitments are items that we will be able to address swiftly, whereas others will take more time to achieve. This topic will therefore be a regular feature on PLOS Blogs, so watch this space. We are committed to pursue these activities in the short as well as long term, and to facilitate change not just at PLOS’ journals, but also in the broader academic community where possible. We count on your support in this endeavor and will appreciate any feedback, help or suggestions for specific actions to take. Thank you!<br /></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/NF4WPlV1nKw/">Early Sharing: Should You Take the Plunge?</a></h4>

<h4>What does early sharing accomplish?</h4>



<p>Scientific discovery is a process of continuous vetting and refinement. While immediate access to the latest findings allows for accelerated discoveries, sharing early and transparently also results in more checkpoints throughout the research process for communities to provide feedback. The need for effective and time-sensitive global collaboration has been further emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting early sharing practices helps ensure your research is available as soon as it’s needed, regardless of your field. </p>



<p>Early sharing allows for the latest research to be connected without waiting for the final publication. Whether it’s through a preprint, open data set, or accessible protocol, researchers are empowered to cite the latest discoveries in their current research. Learning how and when researchers have adopted early sharing is the first step to contributing to this global movement. </p>



<h4>Sharing Before the Study Takes Place</h4>



<p>The research question being pursued and the resulting study design create the foundation of a research project. These core elements are often internally reviewed to ensure the resulting study is as sound and focused as possible, but the greater research community typically doesn’t see the methodology of a study until the results and conclusions are published. By preregistering your study protocol early, you enable broader research assessment to begin at the foundation of a study. The study design itself goes through peer review so that potential improvements or flaws are detected before the study actually takes place. When the final research article is ready to be assessed, editors can consider the study’s rigor and adherence to the study design.   </p>



<p>To help ensure a study follows the highest standards and has long-term reproducibility, <em>PLOS ONE</em> and <em>PLOS Biology</em> both offer <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">preregistration options</a>. Preregistration can help reduce confirmation bias of editors and reviewers by confirming the underlying validity of your research. Additionally, having your protocol published allows others to pursue your study, or to tweak your design to fit their available resources. </p>



<h4>Sharing Initial Findings</h4>



<p>Earlier this year, <em>PLOS Biology</em> announced two new <a href="https://biologue.plos.org/2020/04/14/new-linked-article-types-enable-researchers-to-publish-findings-as-their-work-progresses/">linked articles types</a>: Discovery Reports and Update Articles. To alleviate the pressure of having to wait for a fully formed story to develop, Discovery Articles give researchers the flexibility to publish novel initial findings and as a first step. Once the Discovery Report is published, both the original authors and other research groups can augment the initial report by submitting Update Articles for review. </p>



<p>As multiple Update Articles can be linked to a single Discovery Report, your initial finding can spring into a series of interconnected advancements. </p>



<h4>Sharing Before Publication</h4>



<p>Preprints provide a platform for open, public review that is independent from a journal and doesn’t depend on an invitation from the editor. While the original preprint can be viewed and cited prior to publication, the preprint can be updated as the manuscript is revised to ensure the most recent version of your paper is always available. </p>



<p>PLOS makes the interaction between preprint servers and our journals as simple as possible. You can directly submit your preprint to our journals from medRxiv and bioRxiv, or you can include the DOI of your preprint on the submission form if you used a different server. For those in other subjects, there is an ever-growing collection of active <a href="https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers">preprint servers</a>. Alternatively, authors of life science articles can opt-in to have the paper uploaded to bioRxiv during submission, without any additional work. Our editors are encouraged to consider comments left on a preprint, allowing for the open review platform that preprints provide to potentially accelerate and deepen the review process. </p>



<p>That said, open and accessible data sets are another opportunity to collaborate among far-spanning researchers. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/a-selfish-reason-to-share-research-data/">Recent research</a> has shown that publications that link to data in a repository are cited more frequently on average. As many researchers around the world don’t have access to the infrastructure required to generate their own data sets, making your data available without restrictions is an easy way to ensure your research is maximizing its contribution and usefulness. </p>



<p>Early sharing opens up opportunities throughout the research process to share study designs, initial findings, and data at a global scale. Involve your communities with early sharing practices so that vetting happens throughout the research process, ultimately improving the credibility of your final research output.</p>

Many of the same groups of individuals known to suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes are faring especially poorly during this pandemic. In many ways, the disparate outcomes being documented in COVID-19 are simply offering a magnified view of longstanding health inequities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html#:~:text=means%20is%20lacking.-,What%20is%20health%20equity%3F,be%20as%20healthy%20as%20possible.">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a> stated that “<em>Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy</em>“. To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed. Socially disadvantaged people, who have been historically marginalized and/or disfavored by social and political institutions, have faced significant obstacles to health equity in the midst of COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html">Social distancing</a>, a key recommendation for preventing the spread of COVID-19, has proven to be very difficult for socially disadvantaged persons. Housing insecurity and homelessness are established risk factors for chronic health conditions, including <a href="https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/4/241">kidney disease</a>. In the setting of COVID-19, these challenges have meant that many individuals cannot feasibly maintain the recommended physical distance from others. Further, for people in service professions that require they interact daily with the public, their ability to socially distance has also been quite challenged. Racial and ethnic minorities and low income persons are overrepresented in such professions, which has increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure.</p>
<p>For people who have sought testing for COVID-19, inequities in health care access and services have been on full display. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases?t=1595235018970">One report</a> noted that African Americans patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. cough and fever) were less likely to be given a COVID-19 test than were white persons with the same symptoms. This type of biased delivery of health services can lead to socially disadvantaged individuals presenting later (e.g. for hospitalization) with severe symptoms or even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/beloved-brooklyn-teacher-30-dies-coronavirus-denied-covid/story?id=70376445">death</a>.  As vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are developed and disseminated, individuals who have directly, or vicariously, experienced bias in the health care setting may be reticent to seek these options, out of fear of inequitable treatment.</p>
<p>COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to shortages of food in many communities due to store closures as well as bulk purchases by individuals who can afford to do so. Low-income communities have been particularly affected. A consequence of structural inequities including residential segregation, food access is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379708007290?via%3Dihub">known to vary</a> by community demographics. In this pandemic, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, may be exacerbated, particularly for persons facing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638616306722">food insecurity</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/04/07/game-plan-to-help-those-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-171863">Solutions</a> for addressing the inequities magnified by COVID-19 have been offered and include expanding access to testing and health care, and providing social services to keep vulnerable groups safe. People with kidney diseases are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556">death</a>. Because many are also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30899864/">socially disadvantaged</a>, it will be important to evaluate and expand the services they are provided, including those addressing social needs.</p>

<p><em>Optimal CAR T therapy validation requires a 3-D cellular system that mimics the complex tumour cellular architecture. In a study published in </em><a href="https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Biotechnology</em></a><em> Dillard et al. report the development of colorectal cysts from a single colorectal cell line Caco-2 as simple and reliable tools to validate CAR T-mediated therapy.</em></p>

<p>CAR T cells are T lymphocytes, genetically engineered to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) on their surface that recognizes CD19 marker on the surface of B lymphocytes and also promotes signalling events that control the activation of lysis. This results in the destruction of the B lymphocyte. Since CD19 is a widespread marker in cancerous B cells, CAR-T cells are being used as an allogenic treatment of B-cell malignancies.  The CAR T-mediated immunotherapy for cancer has revolutionized the treatment of ‘liquid tumors’, i.e, haematological, however, it hasn’t been so effective in the treatment of solid tumors, as CAR-T cells are unable to survive in the complex tumour microenvironment and target successfully all the tumor-generating cells.</p>
<p>For this reason, using a two-dimensional (2-D) cellular system, in which CAR-T cells are added in a monolayer of cultured target cancer cells, to validate CAR-T cell functionality and specificity, is inadequate, as the 2-D system does not mimic the challenging 3-D morphology and organization of solid tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cancer cells acquire a different gene expression profile when cultured in 3-D spheroids compared to 2-D, which may affect their recognition by CAR-T cells.</p>
<p>In order to create a simple 3-D cellular system that could be used for the validation of CAR-T cells, the authors took advantage of a colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2, that has been shown to form 3-D cyst-like structures by self-organisation, with the apical surface of the epithelial cells facing a central lumen. First, they transduced Caco-2 cells with the <em>CD19</em> gene, in a way that ensured cell-surface expression of the CD19 antigen on their surface (CD19Caco-2 cells). Next, they showed that CD19CAR-T cells were able to kill CD19Caco-2 cells, as effectively as in a 2-D culture, while Caco-2 cells remained intact. Finally, they demonstrated that the system was compatible with super-resolution microscopy, high-throughput live imaging and bioluminescence assays; hence the ability of the CAR-T cells to kill the cancer cells and destroy the cyst can be monitored with both qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>
<p>This is a simple and versatile method that can be adapted to the use of a variety of cancer lines that have been shown to form similar simple 3-D structures. It could therefore, constitute a powerful tool for the therapeutic validation of CAR-T cells in different contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Bipolar disease is prevalent in homeless people </strong></p>
<p><em>Numerous studies have shown that bipolar disease (BD) is a common disorder among homeless people. In a study published in </em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08819-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a><em> Ayano et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by pulling existing data from the literature, which confirmed and estimated more accurately the high pooled prevalence of BD among homeless people.</em></p>
<p>Bipolar disorder (BP) is a mental health condition characterized by lengthy periods of extreme mood swings. BP has a prevalence of about 1-2.4 % in the general population, but has been shown to affect 2.41 to 42.42% of homeless people, depending on the study. BD has a severe negative effect in homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of disability, substance/drug abuse. In order to provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice, the authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. From a total of 3236 articles identifies, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted. The studies were performed in five countries/continents (Canada, USA, Brazil, Germany, Ireland and France) and were published between 2001 and 2017.</p>
<p>Based on the random-effects model to account for existing heterogeneity the pooled BD prevalence among homeless people was estimated at 11.4%. Subgroup analysis by country/continent showed the prevalence of BD to be 10% in Europe and 13.2 %  in other countries, while subgroup analysis by the quality of the studies showed a pooled BD prevalence of 9.9% for high-quality studies and 11.8% for both low and moderate-quality studies. These numbers are significantly higher than the ones reported for the general population.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12034 aligncenter" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/homeless-person-HL-blog-July-2020-300x270.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Likely reasons for this increased between BD and homelessness is the co-occurrence of other medical conditions, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, which have been associated with an increased risk of bipolar and other mental illnesses. Also, the possible exposure of homeless people to physical and sexual trauma, which is associated with the onset of manic episodes and bipolar disease in risky groups, may also be a factor. Moreover, the higher co-existence of depression, anxiety, psychosis and alcohol-related disorders in homeless people may also constitute a possible reason for the higher prevalence of BD.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates the importance of further high-quality studies to determine the etiologies of the high prevalence of BD observed in homeless people and of targeted interventions to prevent and diagnose BD in these individuals. The authors recommend the strengthening of the mental health services for homeless people.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating committed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the shipping industry</strong></p>
<p><em>The shipping industry has one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and needs to take action to reduce such emissions as soon as possible. In a study published in </em><a href="https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Energy</em></a><em> Bullock et al. analyses for the first time the committed emissions of the shipping sector taking into consideration individual ship type data from existing and new ships and assesses which measures should be taken to reduce baseline committed emissions to meet the Paris agreement goals for action on climate change.</em></p>
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris agreement goal is to keep the increase of global temperature below 2<sup>o</sup>C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 <sup>o</sup>C. For this to be achieved global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be reduced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The shipping sector is the main contributor of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, estimated at around 800 MtCO<sub>2</sub> per year, hence it has set a target of at least 50% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 compared to 2008.  However, until now the committed emissions of shipping, i.e., the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions expected based on existing energy infrastructure, are based on assumptions of ship lifetimes extrapolated from other transport systems. The average scrappage age of ships is 28 years, which is much higher than road transport vehicles, therefore, this practice underestimates committed emissions in shipping. As a result, the ‘carbon budget’, which is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be emitted over time while limiting global warming to the accepted levels of the Paris agreement for shipping industry is estimated to be higher for the shipping industry, than it really should.</p>
<p>In this study the authors analysed committed emissions in 11,000 existing and new ships in the European Union’s new emissions monitoring scheme (EU MRV), taking into account the wide range of ship types, as well as their different sizes and scrappage age, using datasets published for the first time in 2019. It was found that five ship types: container, bulk carriers, ro pax, oil tankers and passenger ships are responsible for 71% of committed emissions, with the highest baseline committed emissions estimated for container ships. In particular, the new containers account for the highest committed emissions, as although they are more efficient, they are much larger than older containers and this has a greater impact. Moreover, passenger ships were found to have disproportionately high emissions, despite their small numbers, due to their long life time. Overall the baseline committed emissions from all existing ships in the EU MRV fleet was found to be 2260 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, much larger than estimated in previous studies. This is equivalent to 85-212% of the carbon budget to achieve the 1.5 <sup>o</sup>C target that is available for the EU MRV fleet, therefore, significant mitigation measures are required to reduce these figures.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12040" style="width: 428px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12040" height="358" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/fig4-300x257.png" width="418" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Committed emissions for existing ships, from the 10 largest ship types through time, taken from the original article.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The authors found that the combination of four measures: slow speed, technical and operational improvements, fuel blending and the use of zero-carbon fuel, if implemented between 2020s-2030s has the potential to reduce the baseline committed emissions by 65% to 793 MtCO2 and achieve the target of keeping within the Paris agreement carbon budgets, without the need for premature scrappage. However, any delay in appropriate implementation would result in a reduction of only 13% of committed emissions.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that we cannot rely on measures to improve the efficiency of new ships in order to deliver what is decided in the Paris agreement and highlights the need to implement measures on existing ships, as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Pilot study finds: Modified short-term fasting reduces chemotherapy toxicity in gynaecological cancer patients</strong></p>
<p><em>Chemotherapy-induced toxicity results in patients postponing chemotherapy or in the reduction of the drugs dose used, thus compromising therapy. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that short-term fasting prior to the onset of chemotherapy has beneficial effects in tolerating chemotherapy. In study published in </em><a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07041-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Cancer</em></a><em> Zorn at al. report a significant reduction of toxicity-related symptoms in patients with gynecological cancer, achieved in a controlled cross-over pilot study that used a modified short-term fasting (mSTF) protocol.</em></p>
<p>Toxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy, a consequence of healthy cells being destroyed together with the cancer cells by the drug cocktail. Fasting is believed to protect normal cells from the detrimental effects of chemotherapy, as they enter a state of reduced cell division and stress resistance, upregulation of DNA repair and induced autophagy. In tumor cells on the other hand, growth pathways remain activated, which renders them more sensitive to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>In a case series study human patients under various fasting regimens were reported to show significantly fewer toxicity-induced symptoms, such as fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, while a randomized control trial showed that a 48-h fasting reduced bone marrow toxicity and DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, a dose-escalation fasting study demonstrated that 72h fasting during chemotherapy was safe and tolerated by the patients, while it resulted in reduced chemotherapy-related toxicity and low-grade fasting-related toxicity.</p>
<p>In this pilot study the authors evaluated the effect of a 96-h fasting on the chemotherapy-induced toxicity in women with gynecological cancer. For the first time the effect of a 6-day intervention of Ketone diet (KD) prior to mSTF on ameliorating the negative effects of fasting was also assessed. The mSTF itself had a ketogenic composition (75% fat, 15% protein and 10% carbohydrate), as it has been shown that fasting achieves best results in a state of ketosis (elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood). The patients, who underwent a calorie restriction to 25% of their daily requirement, as a result of mSTF tolerated the fasting well and experienced much less severe symptoms of chemotherapy-induced toxicity: significantly fewer patients suffered from stomatitis, headaches and weakness and patients also showed significantly less haematological parameters of toxicity during mSTF cycles. Although previous studies had reported reduced cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after STF, in this particular study, this was not observed, possibly because the patients had already overcome these conditions due to preventive medication. Importantly, the patients on mSTM postponed much fewer chemotherapy appointments than the ones on normal diet, which reflects their better tolerance of their treatment and physical condition in general. It was also found that the KD neither reduced fasting-related discomfort nor improved compliance of the fasting regimen.</p>
<p>These results clearly show the potential of mSTF in counteracting chemotherapy-related toxicity and enhancing tolerance of treatment. Further larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of mSTF as a supportive approach to chemotherapy, before recommending this treatment to cancer patients.</p>

WLHIV who do not stay in care do not receive antiretroviral therapy and are at increased <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1511691">risk of passing HIV</a> to their child or partner and may also experience <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737584/">worse</a> HIV-related health outcomes. <a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf">UNAIDS estimate</a> that about 1 in 5 HIV-exposed children in Ghana become infected with HIV by the time of cessation of breastfeeding. This rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the second-highest in West Africa and the fourth-highest among the 21 focus countries <a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf">UNAIDS tracks</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons why the drop-out rates of HIV care are higher in the postpartum year than during pregnancy are not well understood. Researchers have offered <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111421">several theories</a>:  women may fall out of care due to fewer scheduled encounters with the healthcare system, due to a decline in perceived susceptibility of MTCT after childbirth, due to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977376/">prioritization</a> of their child’s health over their own, or due to challenges with childcare — but there is little evidence to support any one of these theories over the others.</p>
<p>To contribute toward a better understanding of this issue, we conducted qualitative interviews with thirty postpartum WLHIV in Ghana, recruited in 2016 from two tertiary hospitals in the urban city of Accra. Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03067-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> presents the barriers women themselves described.</p>
<h3><strong>Multiple barriers</strong></h3>
<p>Women’s accounts suggest that social, economic, and physical health factors, more than a change in individual motivation, may explain why fewer women remain in HIV care in the postpartum year than during pregnancy. Broadly, we found that the social and economic costs of staying in HIV care became higher in the postpartum year and many who dropped out experienced multiple barriers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.</p></blockquote>
<p>ART-related side-effects and HIV denial were the strongest barriers during pregnancy and the fear of re-experiencing the ART-side effects continued to keep mothers away from HIV care even after childbirth. One participant shared her story:</p>
<p><em>During pregnancy, I suffered when I took the drugs due to the side-effects. Thus, anytime I thought of going back for the drugs [after the birth], the thoughts of the side effects came to my mind and troubled me. I became afraid. </em></p>
<h3><strong>The challenge of travel and transport</strong></h3>
<p>One unique barrier in the early postpartum months was difficulty traveling to HIV care due to complications from childbirth or prolonged recovery from a cesarean section. For example, one mother remarked:</p>
<p><em>Most mothers will tell you that the first six months are very tough. Many women take the time to work on themselves since some undergo an operation [i.e., C-section]. Others, too, had a vaginal tear, so they may need some time to take care of themselves. It takes six months or more for a mother to return to a normal life after childbirth [i.e., to be healthy and to visit the HIV treatment centers for care]. Some, too, are single mothers who have no support at home.</em></p>
<p>Relatedly, for a few of the women who had dropped out of care, childbirth was associated with debt, unemployment, or underemployment. This led to a new reliance on others, such as a partner or relative, to give them money before they could make their HIV care visits, even when their motivation to stay in HIV care was high.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12020 alignleft" height="174" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fotolia_17246913_Subscription_XL-300x174.jpg" width="300" />Mode of transportation was the most significant barrier, with increasing costs to mothers facing new sociocultural pressures unique to the postpartum year. Postpartum mothers were motivated to protect their children’s health, and often felt obligated to take a taxi to their clinical appointments instead of the cheaper local bus, called <em>trotro, </em>which they typically took during pregnancy. Taxis could protect their children from the risk of illness and excessive heat common to the hot and crowded <em>trotros, </em>but they were more expensive, costing one participant 70% of her monthly salary.</p>
<p>HIV stigma also contributed to high transportation costs, as some mothers established their HIV care far from their home to avoid being recognized. Further, those who now needed to rely on financial or childcare support to make it to appointments in their postpartum year would find it difficult to do so without disclosing their HIV status.</p>
<h3><strong>Priority of pediatric care</strong></h3>
<p>As a result of these economic and social challenges, one would expect that mothers who had discontinued from HIV care would also be unable to adhere to their pediatric HIV testing or child well-baby visit schedules. However, we found that all the mothers who had dropped out of HIV care, except one, were engaged with the healthcare system for their child’s health. This behavior suggests that in the context of limited resources, mothers prioritized their children’s health over their own.</p>
<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>To close the pregnancy-postpartum HIV-care retention gap, our results call for a package of interventions that minimize the economic burden of accessing HIV care, diminish stigma, and enhance the management of ART-related side effects. The women in our study recommended that HIV-care providers in Ghana consider extending their medication refills from three to six months. This option will not only reduce transportation costs, but it will also allow mothers to recover physically from childbirth. Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology/">Six books to help us understand eating disorders</a></h4>

<p>Some <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/uploads/documents/2018/7/workplace.pdf">70 million people worldwide</a> have an eating disorder and, with the prevalence of disordered eating on the rise,  it’s clear that this presents a significant public health issue. Despite this, many myths and misconceptions abound that are significant barriers to both treatment and public understanding of eating disorders. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, gender, or cultural background.</p><p>We’ve put together a list of books that provide practical information to dispel misconceptions, as well as guidance for people affected by eating disorders and their loved ones.</p><p><strong>1. </strong><strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/if-your-adolescent-has-an-eating-disorder-9780190076825">If Your Adolescent Has An Eating Disorder: An Essential Guide for Parents </a></strong>by <strong>B. Timothy Walsh and Deborah R. Glasofer <img height="216" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eating-dis-147x220.jpg" width="144" /></strong><br />This is an authoritative guide to understanding and helping a teenager with an eating disorder. It is designed for parents of teens who have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or who are at risk of developing one, and for other adults, such as teachers and guidance counselors, who are regularly in contact with at-risk adolescents. The book combines the latest science–including the newest treatments and most up-to-date research findings on eating disorders–with the practical wisdom of parents who have been raising teens with eating disorders.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-9780190926601">Eating Disorders: What Everyone Needs to Know</a> </strong>by <strong>B. Timothy Walsh, Evelyn Attia, and Deborah R. Glasofer</strong><br />Practical yet authoritative, this book defines eating disorders, explains what we know about them based on the latest science, and describes how treatment works. The book dispels common myths about eating disorders, such as the notion that they occur only amongst the affluent, that they affect only girls and women, or that they simply result from environmental factors such as the fashion industry and society’s obsession with thinness. This book is essential reading for those seeking authoritative and current information about these often-misunderstood illnesses.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-void-inside-9780190061166">The Void Inside: Bringing Purging Disorder to Light</a> by Pamela K. Keel<img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/void-145x220.jpg" width="145" /></strong><br />This book chronicles the growing recognition of purging disorder at the turn of the millennium, reviews what science has taught us about the illness, and explains the medical complications that purging may bring. The author, known for her work identifying and naming purging disorder, presents irrefutable evidence that it can no longer be considered a subset of better-known eating disorders. Keel illuminates how the illness impacts the lives of real people to underscore the severity of this hidden eating disorder and the need for greater awareness.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exposure-therapy-for-eating-disorders-9780190069742">Exposure Therapy for Eating Disorders  </a><b>by Carolyn Black Becker, Nicholas R. Farrell, and Glenn Waller</b><br />This book is designed to augment existing eating disorder treatment manuals by providing clinicians with practical advice for maximizing the effectiveness of exposure, regardless of clinical background or evidence-based treatment used. Suitable for use with a range of diagnoses, this easy-to-use guide describes the most up to date empirical research on exposure for eating disorders. The book also provides strategies for overcoming obstacles, including institutional resistance to implementation of exposure therapy.</p><p><strong>5. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/handbook-of-positive-body-image-and-embodiment-9780190841874">Handbook of Positive Body Image and Embodiment  </a>by Tracy L. Tylka and Niva Piran<img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EXrVViuTSC0-145x220.jpg" width="145" /></strong><br />This book is the first comprehensive, research-based resource to address the breadth of innovative theoretical concepts and related practices concerning positive ways of living in the body. Presenting chapters by world-renowned experts in body image and eating behaviors, the handbook explores how therapeutic interventions and public health and policy initiatives can inform scholarly, clinical, and prevention-based work in the field of eating disorders.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-the-facts-9780198715603">Eating Disorders: The Facts </a>by Suzanne Abraham</strong><br />Sympathetically and clearly written, this guide considers why eating disorders occur, and then looks at each in turn, describing the eating behaviours, diagnosis, and treatments available. Case histories and patient perspectives provide insights into the mind of the eating disorder sufferer, making it easier for patients and their families to relate to the topics discussed. The book<em> </em>provides an authoritative resource on eating disorders that will prove valuable for sufferers and their families.</p><p>These titles highlight some of the most pressing issues in the field of eating disorder research. Greater awareness among stakeholders – including healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers, and the general public – can address ongoing challenges and inform future directions.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/vintage-book-light-bulb-wood-table_1007385.htm">Image</a> by jannoon028 via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/six-books-to-help-us-understand-eating-disorders/">Six books to help us understand eating disorders</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/630516433/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2feating-dis-147x220.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/630516433/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/why-chemical-imbalance-is-the-wrong-way-to-talk-about-depression/" rel="nofollow">Why chemical imbalance is the wrong way to talk about depression</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/work-life-balance-5333802_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Many of us find it increasingly difficult to separate our work from our personal lives. Modern technologies exacerbate the problem, with our inability to ‘switch off’ and tendency to take calls and check emails outside of working hours. What’s more, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for those of us working from home, where the line between our jobs and family lives has become even more blurred, and for those working longer shifts in hospitals, supermarkets or elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is already known that work-life imbalances can negatively affect both our physical and mental health. However, we know little about the factors that strengthen or weaken this association. <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09139-w/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><u>New research</u></a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> looks at the influence of gender and level of welfare provision by the state on the link between work-life balance and health.</p>
<p>In their study, Mensah and Adjei analyze data from over 32,000 workers, aged 16 to 64, from 30 European countries. This data was collected as part of the 6<sup>th</sup> European Working Conditions Survey, carried out in 2015 by the <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/"><u>European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)</u>.</a></p>
<p>The authors perform statistical analysis on the association between work-life balance and self-reported health, which previous studies have found to be a reliable proxy of overall health, and factor in other variables such as gender and welfare regime. Validating earlier studies, the results show that there is a significant association between work-life balance and health.</p>
<p><strong>Gender differences in the association between work-life conflict and health</strong></p>
<p>Traditional gender roles permeate our everyday levels such that, in many cultures, women more often take on a caring role within the family unit and men are seen as the so-called ‘breadwinner’. <a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/12951"><u>This is changing</u></a>, with the last 40 years seeing increased participation of women in the labor market and a rise in the number of dual-earning families.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.</p></blockquote>
<p>How, then, does gender affect the association between work-life conflict and self-reported health? Mensah and Adjei find that while men more often report a poor work-life balance across different European countries, there is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.</p>
<p>There may be a number of reasons for this. Women still bear the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2019"><u>greater burden of childcare responsibilities</u></a>, for example, creating additional pressures at home as well as in the workplace. Women also face <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/workplace-gender-discrimination-remains-rife-survey-finds"><u>increased discrimination at work and lower rates of pay</u></a>, both of which may contribute to the impact of work-life conflict on health.</p>
<p><strong>The role of the welfare state</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="wp-image-12015 size-medium alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/postit-240x300.jpg" width="240" />The strength of this study’s large cross-European sample is that it enables comparison between groups of countries with different welfare regimes, with countries classified as Nordic (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway), Conservative (such as Germany and Switzerland), Liberal (UK and Ireland), Southern Europe (such as Greece, Spain and Italy) and Central and Eastern Europe (including Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Croatia and others).</p>
<p>Mensah and Adjei report that work-life balance is best for both working men and women in the Nordic countries. There is also a weaker association between poor work-life balance and poor self-reported health in these countries, which the authors attribute to their substantial welfare provision including availability of childcare, universal healthcare and long parental leave.</p>
<p>The association between work-life conflict and poor health is strongest in countries with Liberal and Conservative welfare regimes, with Conservative states also being the only ones where the association is stronger in men than in women.</p>
<p>Multiple factors may be at play here, including increased emphasis on the male breadwinner role, weaker employment regulation and unions, and more stringent social welfare than the Nordic states. However, it remains to be established why Southern European states, with the least generous welfare policies, fared better. Further work is also needed to determine the specific contribution of individual policies on work-life conflict and health.</p>
<p><strong>Striking a healthy balance in future</strong></p>
<p>On a personal level, the findings of this study may help us to reflect on how often we allow commitments at work encroach on our personal lives and negatively impact our health. So how might we guard against the stresses and strains of work-life conflict in future?</p>
<p>The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity, recommends <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/w/work-life-balance"><u>a number of measures</u></a> including better prioritization of tasks at work, taking proper breaks in the working day, dedicating time for exercise or hobbies, and keeping a record of time spent working or thinking about work.</p>
<blockquote><p>The differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study also points to systemic differences to be addressed by governments and policymakers. As we strive towards equality, the differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.</p>
<p>Of course, countries vary widely in political and economic landscape and so too does the level of social and financial intervention by the state, but strategies to help minimize work-life conflict would surely pay dividends in fostering a healthier population and workforce.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper "Towards a new approach to reveal dynamical organization of the brain using topological data analysis".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Little is known about how our brains dynamically adapt for efficient functioning. Most
previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of
brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by
collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s
dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall
organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an
interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using
existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of
transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and
between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4–9 s) than before. The
individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task
performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into
interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Amir Khan will talk about the paper "Spiking Neural Networks Evolved to Perform Multiplicative Operations".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Multiplicative or divisive changes in tuning curves of individual neurons to one stimulus ("input") as another stimulus ("modulation") is applied, called gain modulation, play an important role in perception and decision making. Since the presence of modulatory synaptic stimulation results in a multiplicative operation by proportionally changing the neuronal input-output relationship, such a change affects the sensitivity of the neuron but not its selectivity. Multiplicative gain modulation has commonly been studied at the level of single neurons. Much less is known about arithmetic operations at the network level. In this work we have evolved small networks of spiking neurons in which the output neurons respond to input with non-linear tuning curves that exhibit gain modulation—the best network showed an over 3-fold multiplicative response to modulation. Interestingly, we have also obtained a network with only 2 interneurons showing an over 2-fold response.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ARRIVE-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>For <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals">BMC Series</a> journals, it is important that the research we consider and publish can be utilised and is trusted.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of animals has been considered and that the harm involved is justified by the expected benefit of the research. To support us, we utilise tools such as the <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines">Animal research: reporting <em>In Vivo </em>Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines</a> to evaluate the integrity and soundness of submissions that report on animal experiments.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/">NC3Rs</a> developed the ARRIVE guidelines; a <a href="https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NC3Rs-ARRIVE-Guidelines-Checklist-fillable.pdf">20 point checklist</a> covering measures associated with bias (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, data handling) with the aim to improving the quality of both scientific research design and reporting of animal studies. The guidelines prompt authors to provide sufficient detail in their research paper that would allow the reader to assess the methodological rigour of the experiment, determine the reliability of the findings, and to reproduce and build upon the work. Unfortunately, the argument for the success of ARRIVE has been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197882">varied</a> since its launch, and despite being widely endorsed by journals, funding bodies and research institutions, the quality of reporting in animal research publications is still far from roubust.</p>
<h3><strong>Problems encountered using the ARRIVE 2010 guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>As an Editor, I have noticed that authors use the ARRIVE checklist in different ways. Given the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001756">inconsistent</a> adoption of ARRIVE by journals, many authors, and <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-10">editors</a>, are still not aware of these guidelines, or see them as an unnecessary box ticking exercise. This lack of awareness can also affect how authors plan their research where issues related to bias may not have been appropriately considered, and this has a knock-on-effect at the manuscript writing stage. At <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></a>, we often receive ARRIVE checklists that are incomplete or don’t correspond to what is reported in the paper. These issues could be related to language barriers or differences in research culture where authors are still not fully aware of the consequences of incomplete reporting. Alternatively, it may be related to the misconception that admitting to non-compliance of an ARRIVE item will disqualify a manuscript from being published. Overall, comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task for editors and reviewers when evaluating the robustness of the methods and results.</p>
<blockquote><p>comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, in an attempt to improve uptake, an international working group was formed to review the original ARRIVE 2010 guidelines and develop a strategy that would make ARRIVE easier for researchers, editors and reviewers to use. We are pleased to announce that the new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines have been published today in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410">PLOS Biology</a> and re-published by <em><a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02451-y">BMC Veterinary Research</a>.</em></p>
<h3><strong>ARRIVE 2.0 – what has changed?  </strong></h3>
<p>The overall guidelines have been simplified. Items from the original checklist have been updated and reorganised and are now presented in two categories: the ‘<strong>ARRIVE Essential 10</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Recommended Set</strong>’.</p>
<p>The ‘ARRIVE Essential 10’ is a list of key items that authors should address in their manuscript text as a minimum standard and represents best practice. If adhered to, reporting of these items should have the biggest impact on improving the quality and reliability of animal research studies.</p>
<p>The second list of recommendations is designed to provide greater context and background to the study. This includes items such as conflicts of interest, protocol registration, and animal housing and welfare aspects. While not strictly essential, these points will add value to the review process, enhancing the transparency of the study design and reporting.</p>
<p>A useful <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000411">Explanation and Elaboration</a> (E&amp;E) document has also be made available. This helps to describe each of the ARRIVE 2.0 items in greater context and detail, and includes best practice examples from the published literature.</p>
<p>The ARRIVE 2.0 update joins a host of other ongoing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021">initiatives</a> in an attempt to address factors contributing to poor reproducibility.  There is still much work to be done to engage key stakeholders to create a process whereby these standards can be consistently implemented and enforced at the research planning stage, and then hopefully mandated by all journals.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The number one cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is diabetes, and the gold standard for diagnosing any kidney disease is through biopsy. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-biopsy">kidney biopsies</a> are not without risks, and although minimal, there is a risk of bleeding and damaging the kidney further by performing this invasive procedure. In addition, some patients cannot have a kidney biopsy when they truly need one because of other comorbidities, anti-coagulant medications, and other factors that make them high risk for complications. Usually for patients with diabetes that present no other concerning findings, the nephrologist might assume its <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/kidney-disease.html">diabetic nephropathy</a>, a complication of diabetes, without performing a kidney biopsy.  Could they be making a mistake?  It might be something else that is treatable.  Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?</p></blockquote>
<p>In a <em>BMC Neprhology </em><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01902-w">publication</a>, Li <em>et al.</em>, examine the potential use of specialized ultrasound – three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound – to diagnose diabetic nephropathy.  This technology takes a large series of 2-D ultrasound images in rapid succession which are then assembled by a computer to create a 3-dimensional image. For pregnant women, a 3-D ultrasound may have been offered to you to look at your growing baby.  Contrast enhanced ultrasound uses intravenous contrast agents consisting of microbubbles/nanobubbles of gas, which oscillate creating an “echo” when exposed to ultrasound waves. This is a better alternative when a patient cannot get contrast agents for a CT or MRI.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-12008 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" height="452" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-1-640x452.png" width="640" />
<p>Li and colleagues used these two technologies to examine 115 patients with diabetes and kidney disease that underwent kidney biopsy to see if they could differentiate between diabetic nephropathy from non-diabetic renal disease (i.e., IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy).  Sixty-four had diabetic nephropathy and 51 had non-diabetic renal disease. We know that diabetic nephropathy is more likely with <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/8/10/1718">longer history of diabetes</a> and with other<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168822705000458"> microvascular complications</a> (like retinopathy).  Li <em>et al.</em>’s data was consistent with these previous studies. They didn’t find any differences with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.  However, they did find that using a logistic regression model for BMI and right kidney volume was statistically significant.  They concluded that 3-D ultrasound has the potential to be an option in our arsenal for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy.</p>
<p>Li <em>et al.</em> is one of a many researchers looking at utilizing 3-D ultrasound for diagnosing and managing kidney pathology.  Not surprisingly it’s been looked at for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306987/">determining kidney volume in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</a>.  And <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009042951830774X">Calio <em>et al.</em></a> examined 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasound use in surveillance for renal cell carcinoma recurrence after ablation.</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, I’m not running out to get a 3-D ultrasounds just yet, but I’m keeping it in mind for the future. After further studies, I might be ordering it for that diabetic patient with chronic kidney disease to make sure I’m not missing something.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Qzkv2xVliT0/">Improving Research Assessment in the Triage Phase of Review</a></h4>

<p><em>Authors: Helen Sitar is the community coordinator for DORA and a Science Policy Programme Officer at</em><a href="https://www.embo.org/"><em> EMBO</em></a><em> and Anna Hatch is </em><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><em>DORA</em></a><em>’s program director. <em>DORA receives financial support from PLOS via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.</em></em></p>



<p>When seeking to fill an open faculty position, it’s common for universities to receive hundreds of applications for a single job. Unsurprisingly, such a high level of competition creates a bottleneck early in the hiring process. The ‘triage’ phase of review therefore becomes a critical point, as it determines which applicants receive further consideration.</p>



<p>The ability to efficiently yet effectively triage applications has been a long-standing challenge for the academic community. Time constraints make triage prone to the influence of unintended biases and proxy measures of success, such as the journals where the candidate has published or their institutional affiliations.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, consistency between reviewers presents another challenge.  Even when selecting for the same purpose, processes and standards can vary greatly between individual reviewers or committees, due to differing assumptions about the process or the criteria for making judgments. Reviewers may prefer certain institutions, labs, or journals, or attach different values to funding track records. If reviewers are unaware of their own biases for certain community affiliations, these <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-to-combat-bias-in-hiring/9a403c85-c162-4a28-9464-5ff2d5ea9371">can influence decision-making</a>. Ultimately, biased hiring processes impede underrepresented and minoritized scholars from making progress in their academic careers, resulting in inequalities in academic leadership and more. Without any intervention, one current model of postdoc to faculty transitions suggests that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393">faculty diversity will not increase significantly</a> until 2080.</p>



<p><strong>Testing three approaches to triage</strong></p>



<p>To stimulate discussion of the challenges associated with the triage process, and to identify possible solutions, DORA organized an interactive session for the 2019 ASCB | EMBO Meeting. Through a mock-review exercise, participants worked in small groups to test different approaches to the triage process. The seventeen participantsーrepresenting different groups and career stages, including postdocs, faculty members, administrators, publishers, and staff from other non-profit initiativesーwere given the description of a faculty position to ‘hire,’ general instructions on how to conduct the triage, and a set of anonymized application materials (CVs and cover letters). Because the session was limited to 75 minutes, other application materials, including letters of reference, teaching statements, and diversity statements, were not included in our informal exercise.</p>



<p>The application materials were anonymized, and the author names from the references listed in the bibliographies were also removed. A note under each reference, however, indicated the applicant’s position in the author list (e.g. “2nd author, 8 authors total”). The CVs and cover letters provided to two of the participant groups were further altered, by removing institutional names and journal titles when they were presented. One of these groups was provided with an assessment matrix to guide the evaluation of different competency areas: research, teaching and mentorship, equity and inclusion, and service to scientific or academic communities.</p>



<p>By informally experimenting with these triage approaches, our goal was to understand what information people use to make judgments during the triage phase. We were also keen to surface ideas about improving the triage process. Below we summarize the discussion and insights that emerged from our exercise.</p>



<p><strong>What’s in a name?</strong></p>



<p>CVs are littered with names, including those of applicants’ advisors, collaborators, coauthors, and references, which may yield strong associations for reviewers. These names can divert the reviewer’s focus from the work presented and onto the context and community in which it has been conducted. One way that names have the potential to mislead reviewers is through ingroup favoritism, wherein reviewers may gravitate towards the individuals that present affiliations most like themselves.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, some individuals did not notice that names had been omitted from the application materials in our exercise. And others reported that it did not negatively impede the review process. Without names, participants found they became more attentive to the remaining details. For example, one group reported paying greater attention to the institutions where candidates received their training.  But relying on the names of institutions is also problematic, because they do not speak directly to the accomplishments or contributions of an individual, which should be the focus when hiring.</p>



<p><strong>Institution and journal prestige</strong></p>



<p>Interestingly, the lack of institutional and journal names in materials did not detract from the participants’ ability to understand an applicant’s profile, as long as sufficient detail on their academic record had been included. Specifically, participants were interested in knowing how an applicant had contributed to the community at large, or to their department or research group, as this is a better indicator of their skills than their institutional affiliation.</p>



<p>Journal names were deemed generally unnecessary as well, especially when an applicant had provided a brief 2-4 sentence explanation summarizing what an article achieved and their specific contribution. This is not the first time DORA has received this feedback; it was suggested at a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/1fd1018c/research-assessment-reducing-bias-in-the-evaluation-of-researchers">previous conference session in 2018</a>.</p>



<p>The participants who saw journal names in the application materials reported that they realized they were using them as a way of evaluation; these participants proposed that their assessments might have been fairer had the journal titles been removed. However, participants still wanted access to the articles’ DOIs to make papers easier to find, read, and evaluate.</p>



<p>One group reported that in the absence of journal names, they paid more attention to the author order and used this to determine the importance of the applicants’ contributions to each work. But others argued that knowing the authorship order for a publication did little to indicate an applicant’s role in contributing to a paper or project, and therefore was not particularly useful information. Tools like the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (<a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">CRediT</a>) can help parse apart how an individual contributed to an article or project.</p>



<p><strong><em>Details instead of names</em></strong></p>



<p>The problem with preferring candidates with well-known labs, institutions or awards named on their CVs is that by valuing reputation, departments narrow their search for talent to within known spheres. In doing so, they will miss out on hiring great researchers who have yet to be recognized by a prestigious award or hired into a well-known lab. When personal, institution, and journal names were removed at the same time in our exercise, some participants noticed that many CVs lacked details necessary to understand applicants’ skill areas. Some such details may have been in materials, such as teaching statements or reference letters, not available for the exercise. The reaction of participants to omission of these details from applicants’ CVs and cover letters underscores the importance of communicating one’s own research interests, approach to science, unique skills, and teaching and mentoring abilities. Only with this information can reviewers accurately evaluate candidates and suitability to a particular faculty role.</p>



<p>There was some disagreement regarding the necessity of including several details common to applicant CVs, including assessing candidates based on their receipt of awards or grants. Some participants paid close attention to mentions of grants, and attributed great value to the fact that an applicant had received an independent grant. Others debated the level of confidence one should have in a person’s abilities based on their receipt of grants, as this can contribute to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">“Mathew effect”</a> of people already recognized receiving further recognition because of previous awards.</p>



<p><strong>Consistency is key</strong></p>



<p>In the triage process, it is clearly important for reviewers to be able to quickly find relevant information. The necessity of this was a major topic of discussion in our session, particularly when it came to the question of being able to compare candidates with ease. The lack of consistent organization of CVs made it complicated for participants to find the relevant information needed to make judgments of applicant’s strengths in various areas (e.g. research, teaching, leadership, inclusivity, service). Moreover, some applicants’ CVs were much longer than others, which reviewers found cumbersome as the length made finding specific pieces of information even more challenging.</p>



<p>To address the need for organized CVs, the concept of a structured narrative format was mentioned in our discussions as an option to build consistency into the triage process. The <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/">Royal Society</a> in the United Kingdom, the <a href="https://sfdora.org/2019/11/14/quality-over-quantity-how-the-dutch-research-council-is-giving-researchers-the-opportunity-to-showcase-diverse-types-of-talent/">Dutch Research Council</a>, and the <a href="https://scicv.ch/">Swiss National Science Foundation</a> are each experimenting with standard structured narrative CV formats. So far, the Dutch Research Council has received mostly <a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/04/14/doras-first-funder-discussion-updates-from-swiss-national-science-foundation-wellcome-trust-and-the-dutch-research-council/">positive feedback</a> on its new narrative. Reviewers report appreciating the added context the narrative format provides, and the Council has found that it leads to a more diverse selection of researchers. Some participants in our session, however, were skeptical of enforcing a standard template CV, noting that it could restrict creativity and limit applicants in describing work which may not fit neatly into any of the preconceived categories.</p>



<p><strong>Standardizing judgments</strong></p>



<p>Every reviewer has their own ‘way’ of sorting through applications, and specific criteria that they look for when deciding who to ‘keep’ or ‘eliminate’ in a triage round of review. In our session, participants using an assessment matrix advocated for a short discussion between reviewers to find a common set of standards before embarking on the triage process, as a way to increase consistent decision making and help minimize the effects of implicit bias. The Germans call this process towards reaching a collective agreement—‘<em>abstimmen’</em>. Directly translated it means “off-voting,” or voting before one begins something. Asking reviewers to calibrate how they interpret the categories in the rubric would ideally result in more consistent assessment of all individuals.</p>



<p>The overarching framing for the discussion was the tension between the need for efficient, accurate assessment versus the burden of devoting attention to details in every application. While some participants stated firmly that the use of rubrics may slow down the triage process, the group generally agreed that rubrics allow for uniform standards to be applied and that consistency should be valued. Still, a few others were resistant, stating that it was not desirable to ‘over-engineer’ the process.</p>



<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>



<p>Universities and research funders are increasingly reconsidering the relevance and importance of researchers’ contributions when assessing them for hiring, promotion or funding. Across the DORA and wider research communities, there are numerous discussions on how to demonstrate the value of different contributions, whether it be via descriptive narratives, article-level metrics, teaching evaluations, or other means. The triage process is the front line to further review and consideration—and is therefore both important and influential in determining the makeup of the research community and its leadership.</p>



<p>The scholarly community has not yet reached a consensus regarding which methods for evaluation are best suited to different purposes or situations, and many believe that there will never be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to research evaluation. Yet demands for employment and funding continue to grow, resulting in more challenges for applicants and review committees in every selection process. And as the number of PhD graduates continues to exceed the number of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/digest/nsf16300.pdf">available positions in academia</a>, academics can expect the triage process for applications to become ever more challenging.</p>



<p>Instilling standards and structure into research assessment processes, especially during the triage phase of review for faculty searches, appears to be a particularly robust option for reducing bias. To achieve this, universities can ask applicants to use a structured narrative CV template. Institutions can also develop evaluation assessment matrices and have conversations amongst reviewers to set standards and identify desirable applicant qualities and characteristics. By removing journal titles and replacing them with 2-4 sentence article summaries that articulate key findings and specify the researcher’s contributions, reviewers would be provided with information better suited to judging researchers’ contributions at the triage stage. When researchers and institutions reflect on and carefully choose what types of information are used to judge scholarly contributions, evaluation processes can be brought into alignment with community values.<strong></strong></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/alcohol-492871_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>You have probably been in situations where someone offers you an alcoholic drink and you feel like you have to drink it. Or perhaps you offer people a drink and make sure that they join in the fun. Peer pressure to drink alcohol is common in our everyday lives; from parties, your local pub, to nowadays COVID-19 pandemic friendly social distancing beers on Zoom with your mates.</p>
<p>Based on our systematic review of 13 qualitative research studies here are five key lessons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Peer pressure is not just experienced by adolescents and young people:</strong></p>
<p>A common perception is that peer pressure exists mainly in young people. However, peer pressure can affect people of all ages. The review found the adults often saw themselves as ‘older and wiser’ compared to when they were young. But many still experienced pressures to drink and continue drinking. Who hasn’t had the offer of ‘one for the road’?</p>
<p><strong>2. People can feel threatened by peer pressure:</strong></p>
<p>Peer pressure experiences varied from friendly banter to aggressive forms of pressure where people felt alcohol was ‘forced on you’. Being encouraged to ‘keep up’ with others’ drinking was a common reason for drinking too much.</p>
<p><strong>3. Peer pressure can have a negative impact:</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, to get rid of peer pressure many people gave in and drank more alcohol. They either had a drink when they didn’t want to drink, or drank more than they had intended. Drinking alcohol in response to peer pressure was seen as ‘caving in’. Most people who drank as a result of peer pressure regretted this decision later.</p>
<p><strong>4. Our wider social context matters to build and keep up peer pressure:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The social surroundings often influenced peer pressure to drink. Drinking was seen as ‘a sociable thing’ – as normal and helping you to fit in. For men, drinking could also be seen as a way to show their masculinity, which included ‘drinking like a man’ and choosing manly drinks.  Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>5. People develop strategies to deal with peer pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Many reported using strategies to avoid pressure. Strategies included ‘nursing your drink’, drinking alcohol-free options which mimic alcoholic in flavor and appearance, or driving their car to provide an excuse for not drinking which would usually be accepted. Some people who did not drink much alcohol ‘came out’ out about their drinking preference, but this seemed to be rare. Others selected their group of friends to make sure it included non-drinkers or those who only drank moderate amounts.</p>
<p>The next time that you’re at a party, in the pub or having social distancing beers on Zoom, will you recognize when you are pressured to drink? Will you cave into the peer pressure, or have a strategy to deal with it? And what can you do to make sure that people don’t feel like they have to drink alcohol if they don’t want to?</p>

Scholarly publishing is broken, and no repair is possible. At least let's point fingers at the elites and laugh. Can science trust Science?

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="90" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/logo-bmcoralhealth-pr-140x90.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Water fluoridation is a measure to prevent caries, a disease of significant public health importance. Caries, when not managed, result in pain and discomfort for individuals and have further implications for the health and well-being of the affected individual, such as retarded growth and development of pre-school children. The huge cost of managing caries has significant impact on the allocation of public health funding.</p>
<p>Different management strategies have been employed to prevent caries. Behaviour based interventions to reduce individual’s exposure to caries’ risk factors such as a reduction in sugar consumption, have limited success. Public water fluoridation is a cost-effective approach to facilitate access of populations to systematic fluoride and, in turn, reduce caries.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11995" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11995" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Water-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© samopauser / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The effectiveness of water fluoridation is still being extensively debated globally.  First, there is contradictory evidence on its effectiveness in preventing caries and there are reported risks of adverse effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. There are also debates weighing up the potential health benefits in the context of ethical principles and personal liberties.  Fluoridation reduces the risk of ill health in a manner which protects the vulnerable and reduces health outcome inequality between the different socioeconomic groups. Those who oppose fluoridation do so on the grounds that it is unethical to coerce individuals to live healthy lives, and emphasises the importance of consent before any health intervention.</p>
<p>Given the level of interest in public water fluoridation, the range and complexity of the public debate, and its implication for policy making, this Collection aims to bring together empirical research papers, and theoretical and conceptual analyses about water fluoridation and caries. The Collection will consider manuscripts on the following three themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population level impact of the introduction or the cessation of water fluoridation on health</li>
<li>Barriers to the implementation of fluoridation and reasons for its cessation, including the assessment and evaluation of the attitudes and knowledge of members of the public, dental professionals and policy makers on water fluoridation</li>
<li>Ethical arguments for and against water fluoridation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any research you would like us to consider, please submit directly to BMC Oral Health stating in your cover letter that you wish to be considered for the Collection “Something in the Water”</p>
<p>To view the articles already published in this Collection, please visit our website: https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Fluoride</p>
<p>Alternatively you can email your pre-submission queries to Anne Menard (anne.menard@biomedcentral.com).</p>
