            <p><em><img alt="human head model with open window on side idea concept" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15624" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-599252754.jpg?w=845" />By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://clippings.me/users/d_a_robson">David Robson</a></p>
<p>If you want to maximise a person’s intellectual potential, the general consensus for a long time has been that you need to start young. According to this traditional view, early childhood offers a precious “window of opportunity” or “sensitive period” for learning that closes slowly as we reach adolescence. It’s the reason that toddlers find it easier to master the accent of a foreign language, for instance.</p>
<p>This view has even shaped educational policy. If you want to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds, for instance, some psychologists had argued that you would do better to target primary schools, with <a href="http://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/Heckman_Science_v312_2006.pdf">diminishing returns for interventions later in life</a>, as if badly performing <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962201-1/fulltext?rss=yes">teenagers were something of a lost cause</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah-Jayne Blakemore at University College London has spent the last decade <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain">over-turning some of these assumptions</a>, showing that the adolescent brain is still remarkably flexible as it <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jayne_blakemore_the_mysterious_workings_of_the_adolescent_brain">undergoes profound anatomical changes</a>. “The idea that the brain is somehow fixed in early childhood, which was an idea that was very strongly believed up until fairly recently, is completely wrong,” she told <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain"><em>Edge</em> in 2012</a>. The transformation is particularly marked in the prefrontal lobes (located behind the forehead) and the parietal lobes (underneath and just behind the top of your head) – two regions that are involved in abstract thought.</p>
<p>The upshot is that teenagers may go through a second sensitive period, in which they are particularly responsive to certain kinds of intellectual stimulation. A new <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/12/1620">paper</a> from Blakemore’s lab, published in <em>Psychological Science,</em> builds on this idea, showing that our ability to learn certain kinds of analytical skills doesn’t diminish after childhood, but actually increases through adolescence and into early adulthood.</p>
<p><span id="more-15601"></span></p>
<p><img alt="ravens" class=" size-full wp-image-15613 alignleft" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/ravens.png?w=845" />The team – led by Lisa Knoll – recruited more than 600 participants aged 11 to 33, and randomly assigned them to three groups, each trained in a different skill. They taught the first group “numerosity discrimination”, which involved rapidly guessing the number of coloured dots to appear on a screen. They trained the second group in “relational reasoning”: the ability to detect abstract rules and relationships using the kind of non-verbal puzzles (known as Raven’s Matrices) that are common in some IQ tests (see image left). The third group, meanwhile, honed their facial perception: they judged repeatedly whether two photos, shown in rapid succession, represented the same person or not.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that these skills don’t require any advanced factual knowledge. Instead, they represent a broader capacity for abstract thought and pattern recognition that might be useful for many kinds of academic work.</p>
<p>The online training sessions were short but frequent, lasting a maximum of 12 minutes a day for 20 days. The participants were then tested – with the same kinds of puzzles used in training – shortly after they had finished their last session, and again a few months later, to see whether the skills had stuck</p>
<p>Sadly, the participants in the third group would have been disappointed if they ever had hopes of being a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/05/metropolitan-police-super-recognisers">super-recogniser</a>” – their facial perception showed next to no improvement.</p>
<p>But the hard work paid off for many of the other participants – those learning the relational reasoning and the numerosity discrimination had all boosted their scores. Based on these successes, Blakemore, Knoll and colleagues next examined whether those gains depended on the participants’ age.</p>
<p>According to the accepted wisdom, they should have seen the greatest dividends among the youngest subjects aged 11-13, when they were closest to that childhood window of opportunity. But as the psychologists had expected, the older participants turned out to gain the most from the training. The late adolescents (aged 16-18) improved their relational reasoning by around 10 per cent, for instance – nearly twice the gains of younger participants. Even the adults in the group tended to perform better than the youngsters, suggesting that our 20s and early 30s may still be a fertile time for self-improvement.</p>
<p>At least in these kinds of analytical skills, the window of opportunity was still wide open, perhaps reflecting the greater neuroplasticity – the ability to forge new neural circuits – of the prefrontal cortex that Blakemore had previously observed in the brain scans. If so, it supports her idea that we may have multiple sensitive periods for different kinds of skills depending on the brain’s development at that time. As one window of opportunity closes, another may open.</p>
<p>There are other potential explanations, though. The researchers tried to control for the participants’ motivation, showing that the results still held when you took into account the number of completed training sessions. It seems the older participants weren’t just trying harder. But it’s also possible that the teenagers and adults had developed better cognitive strategies for learning: deliberate mental procedures that don’t necessarily reflect greater anatomical plasticity.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">recent controversies surrounding brain training</a>, it’s also worth noting that we don’t know whether these improvements led to meaningful changes in other areas of the participants’ lives. Blakemore and Knoll couldn’t find any corresponding boost in working memory, for instance, and we don’t know if these abstract analytical skills would correspond to a greater aptitude for mathematics or science at school or university.</p>
<p>Even so, I’m intrigued about the potential implications and the promise this holds for future research, adding further evidence to the growing body of work showing that adolescence is a fascinating and potentially fertile period of intellectual growth. Contrary to our <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11410483/Revealed-the-science-behind-teenage-laziness.html">sometimes dim view of teenagers</a>, there’s much more to those years than the acne and the angst.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="A happy couple runs through waves on sunlit beach" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15595" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-167408896.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Poets have long described the mind-altering effects of a passionate relationship – “my love’s a noble madness” wrote John Dryden. “Of all the emotions,” said Cicero, “there is none more violent than love. Love is a madness.” Psychology research is beginning to back this up. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9380-3">recent study</a> found that students in the early days of a passionate relationship exhibited reduced cognitive control in basic psychological tests. Now brain researchers in Japan have started to look for the neural correlates of these effects. <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01763/full?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Psychology-w47-2016#B8">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, Hiroaki Kawamichi and his colleagues report the results of their brain imaging experiment showing that participants in the relatively early stages of a romantic relationship had reduced grey matter in a region of the brain involved in processing reward, which might suggest their brains had adjusted to the intensity of their love affair.</p>
<p><span id="more-15510"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited  56 young men and women who were currently in a romantic relationship of at least one month’s duration (the average length was 17 months), and for comparison they recruited 57 age-matched control participants who were not currently in a relationship. All the participants completed a happiness survey and also underwent a structural brain scan.</p>
<p>The participants in an early-stage romantic relationship were happier than those who were single. And looking across the entire brain, the researchers found one specific area – the right-dorsal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum">striatum</a> – that was structurally different in the in-love participants compared with the singletons, in terms of there being reduced grey matter density in the lovers. This region is found near the front of the brain, beneath the cortex and is involved in reward processing.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that the researchers found this brain difference but without any psychological testing, or functional or connectivity-based brain scanning – which could show how brain areas speak to each other and how they operate during different mental activities – it’s very difficult to interpret its meaning.</p>
<p>Another short-coming is that the scans were taken at just one point in time, so we’ve no way of knowing if being in love shrinks the right-dorsal striatum or if people with less grey matter in this area are more likely to fall in love (I’m also using terms like “in love” liberally because we don’t have any detail on the intensity of the participants’ romances). The only clue we have about cause and effect here is that, across all participants, the researchers found no link between striatal volume and total time in life spent in romantic relationships, suggesting a reversibility to any potential effects of romance on the brain.</p>
<p>Putting these important cautions to one side, it does seem plausible that enjoying a passionate romance could lead to grey matter reductions in the striatum, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911001911">just as has been found in cocaine users</a>, for example. This would make sense if you think of being in love as an intensely rewarding time, in which case the brain might “down-regulate” its reward sensitivity, adjusting to a world where there is joy to be found in each touch and embrace with, or even merely thoughts of, that special other. It might also explain why a split can be so painful – the brain spoilt by such constant reward, left craving and expectant for a comfort that’s no longer there.</p>

 Accumulating data suggest that metastatic dissemination often occurs early during tumour formation, but the mechanisms of early metastatic spread have not yet been addressed. Here, by studying metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer model, we show that progesterone-induced signalling triggers migration of cancer cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promotes proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by increased HER2 expression and tumour-cell density involving microRNA-mediated progesterone receptor downregulation, and was reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness features, migrated more and founded more metastases than cells from dense, advanced tumours. Notably, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived from early disseminated cancer cells. Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these findings for human metastatic dissemination.

 The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

 Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths; metastatic lesions develop from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that can remain dormant. Metastasis-initiating cells are thought to originate from a subpopulation present in progressed, invasive tumours. However, DCCs detected in patients before the manifestation of breast-cancer metastasis contain fewer genetic abnormalities than primary tumours or than DCCs from patients with metastases. These findings, and those in pancreatic cancer and melanoma models, indicate that dissemination might occur during the early stages of tumour evolution. However, the mechanisms that might allow early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) to complete all steps of metastasis are unknown. Here we show that, in early lesions in mice and before any apparent primary tumour masses are detected, there is a sub-population of Her2+p-p38lop-Atf2loTwist1hiE-cadlo early cancer cells that is invasive and can spread to target organs. Intra-vital imaging and organoid studies of early lesions showed that Her2+ eDCC precursors invaded locally, intravasated and lodged in target organs. Her2+ eDCCs activated a Wnt-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dissemination program but without complete loss of the epithelial phenotype, which was reversed by Her2 or Wnt inhibition. Notably, although the majority of eDCCs were Twist1hiE-cadlo and dormant, they eventually initiated metastasis. Our work identifies a mechanism for early dissemination in which Her2 aberrantly activates a program similar to mammary ductal branching that generates eDCCs that are capable of forming metastasis after a dormancy phase.

 The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels.

 Seahorses have a specialized morphology that includes a toothless tubular mouth, a body covered with bony plates, a male brood pouch, and the absence of caudal and pelvic fins. Here we report the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome of the tiger tail seahorse, Hippocampus comes. Comparative genomic analysis identifies higher protein and nucleotide evolutionary rates in H. comes compared with other teleost fish genomes. We identified an astacin metalloprotease gene family that has undergone expansion and is highly expressed in the male brood pouch. We also find that the H. comes genome lacks enamel matrix protein-coding proline/glutamine-rich secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes, which might have led to the loss of mineralized teeth. tbx4, a regulator of hindlimb development, is also not found in H. comes genome. Knockout of tbx4 in zebrafish showed a ‘pelvic fin-loss’ phenotype similar to that of seahorses.

 The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential and resilience. Genetic modification is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops such as wheat. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop growth and development. Here we show that application of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed and constructed based on a ‘signalling-precursor’ concept for permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other organism function.

 The type III secretion (T3S) injectisome is a specialized protein nanomachine that is critical for the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, including purveyors of plague, typhoid fever, whooping cough, sexually transmitted infections and major nosocomial infections. This syringe-shaped 3.5-MDa macromolecular assembly spans both bacterial membranes and that of the infected host cell. The internal channel formed by the injectisome allows for the direct delivery of partially unfolded virulence effectors into the host cytoplasm. The structural foundation of the injectisome is the basal body, a molecular lock-nut structure composed predominantly of three proteins that form highly oligomerized concentric rings spanning the inner and outer membranes. Here we present the structure of the prototypical Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 1 basal body, determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, with the inner-membrane-ring and outer-membrane-ring oligomers defined at 4.3 Å and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. This work presents the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution structural characterization of the major components of the basal body in the assembled state, including that of the widespread class of outer-membrane portals known as secretins.

 Enzymes are ideal for use in asymmetric catalysis by the chemical industry, because their chemical compositions can be tailored to a specific substrate and selectivity pattern while providing efficiencies and selectivities that surpass those of classical synthetic methods. However, enzymes are limited to reactions that are found in nature and, as such, facilitate fewer types of transformation than do other forms of catalysis. Thus, a longstanding challenge in the field of biologically mediated catalysis has been to develop enzymes with new catalytic functions. Here we describe a method for achieving catalytic promiscuity that uses the photoexcited state of nicotinamide co-factors (molecules that assist enzyme-mediated catalysis). Under irradiation with visible light, the nicotinamide-dependent enzyme known as ketoreductase can be transformed from a carbonyl reductase into an initiator of radical species and a chiral source of hydrogen atoms. We demonstrate this new reactivity through a highly enantioselective radical dehalogenation of lactones—a challenging transformation for small-molecule catalysts. Mechanistic experiments support the theory that a radical species acts as an intermediate in this reaction, with NADH and NADPH (the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, respectively) serving as both a photoreductant and the source of hydrogen atoms. To our knowledge, this method represents the first example of photo-induced enzyme promiscuity, and highlights the potential for accessing new reactivity from existing enzymes simply by using the excited states of common biological co-factors. This represents a departure from existing light-driven biocatalytic techniques, which are typically explored in the context of co-factor regeneration.

            <p>A provocative new report suggests a low-cost, non-invasive testing protocol may identify older individuals at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators discovered testing individuals’ ability to recognize, remember and distinguish between odors provided similar recommendations as genetic, imaging, and more detailed memory tests.</p>
<p>The report — suggesting testing of both olfactory and cognitive abilities as a means to designate candidates for treatments designed to halt or slow Alzheimer’s symptom development — has been published online in Annals of Neurology.</p>
<p>Mark Albers, M.D., Ph.D., of the MGH Department of Neurology, the principal investigator and corresponding author of the report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is increasing evidence that the neurodegeneration behind Alzheimer’s disease starts at least 10 years before the onset of memory symptoms. The development of a digitally-enabled, affordable, accessible, and non-invasive means to identify healthy individuals who are at risk is a critical step to developing therapies that slow down or halt Alzheimer’s disease progression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is well-known that brain circuits that process olfactory information can be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, and several studies have documented a diminished ability to identify odors in affected individuals.</p>
<p>Other studies have associated deficits in odor identification with established Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and with greater rates of cognitive decline. However, the most commonly used test of olfactory ability — the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test — has a number of limitations and does not take into account the great variation in olfactory ability among healthy individuals.</p>
<p>In the research the MGH team used a battery of four tests to addresses both olfactory and cognitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the OPID (Odor Percept IDentification)-10 test, participants are presented with a battery of 10 odors — menthol, clove, leather, strawberry, lilac, pineapple, smoke, soap, grape, or lemon. After experiencing each odor for two seconds, they are asked whether the scent is familiar and then asked to choose among four words — from the names listed above — for the one that best describes the odor.</li>
<li>Participants then complete the Odor Awareness Scale (OAS), a previously validated questionnaire that assesses their overall attention to environmental odors and how they are affected emotionally and behaviorally by scents.</li>
<li>The OPID-20 test includes the 10 odors previously presented and an additional 10 — banana, garlic, cherry, baby powder, grass, fruit punch, peach, chocolate, dirt, and orange. Participants are first asked whether a presented odor was included in the OPID-10 test and then asked which word best describes the odor. Their ability to remember odors from the first test determines their POEM (Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory) score.</li>
<li>In the Odor Discrimination (OD) test, participants are presented with two consecutive odors and asked whether they were different or the same, a process that is repeated 12 times with different paired scents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study recruited 183 participants, most of whom were enrolled in ongoing studies at the MGH-based Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.</p>
<p>At the time of the olfactory testing, 70 were cognitively normal, 74 tested normal on cognitive tests but were personally concerned about their cognitive abilities, 29 had mild cognitive impairment, and 10 had been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>As part of the studies they were enrolled in, all of them had comprehensive medical and neurological examinations — including annual tests of their memory and cognitive abilities — and several had brain imaging studies of Alzheimer’s-associated factors.</p>
<p>Results of the OPID-20 test significantly differentiated among the four groups of participants, and those results correlated with the thinning of two brain regions — the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex — previously associated with Alzheimer’s risk.</p>
<p>Participants’ ability to remember a previously presented aroma, as reflected in the POEM score, also showed significant differences between the two cognitively normal groups and participants with Alzheimer’s disease, whose results were no better than chance.</p>
<p>Because the ability of normal individuals to recognize and discriminate between odors can vary by as much as 40 times, the POEM scores of the two cognitively normal groups were compared with what would have been predicted based on their ability to identify and differentiate between odors, as reflected in the OAS and OD tests.</p>
<p>That comparison determined whether each individual was a good or poor POEM performer, and poor POEM performers were more likely to have the variant of the APOE gene associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. While results of an annual test of short-term memory improved year-to-year for the good POEM performers, no such improvement was seen among the poor performers, who also showed thinning of the entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p>Albers and his colleagues are currently recruiting participants for a larger-scale study to validate these results:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is well recognized that early diagnosis and intervention are likely to produce the most effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease — preventing the onset or the progression of symptoms. If these results hold up, this sort of inexpensive, noninvasive screening could help us identify the best candidates for novel therapies to prevent the development of symptoms of this tragic disease.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In England there’s an independent health advisory body that provides guidelines to clinicians working in the NHS, to make sure that wherever patients are in the country, they receive the best possible evidence-backed care. <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) was set up in 1999 and many of its guidelines pertain to mental health, and they often promote psychological approaches – for example, the guidelines for depression state that talking therapies should be the first-line of treatment for all but the most severely affected patients. While clinical and counselling psychologists have been involved in producing these guidelines, many of their colleagues – especially those in practice – are highly critical of them. Why? A series of interviews with 11 clinical psychologists, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2054/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience">published in <em>Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy</em></a>, sheds new light on the scepticism and concern felt towards NICE guidelines, and why some psychologists are even deliberately ignoring them.</p>
<p><span id="more-15369"></span></p>
<p>Alex Court at the Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology interviewed 11 clinical psychologists “in routine practice in the NHS” for roughly an hour each. Court’s approach was open-ended and he began each interview by simply asking each psychologist to share their thoughts on the NICE guidelines. Court subsequently transcribed the interviews and together with his colleagues he set about looking for emerging themes in their answers. He kept a diary throughout, in part to reflect on how his own opinions might be influencing his interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>The psychologists valued the NICE guidelines for the way that they provide a useful roundup of the latest evidence relevant to a particular condition or social issue, and also for the fact they often promoted psychological approaches. However, many of the psychologists were also very concerned about the premise of the guidelines, especially their grounding in a medical perspective on psychological distress, and the implication that the evidence is “neat” and that there is a correct approach across the board. The psychologists felt this curtailed their freedom to use their judgment and tailor their approach to individual patients. In particular there was a feeling that the guidelines are biased toward Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), and that they could influence NHS commissioners and managers to favour cost-saving approaches, to the potential detriment of individual patients.</p>
<p>Given these concerns, some of the interviewees said they sometimes gave managers the impression that they were delivering NICE-approved treatments, even when they weren’t:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would probably say I’m doing CBT, even if I’m not doing, you know, even if it’s a bit fudgy around the edges,” said Jenny (the study doesn’t use the psychologists’ real names).</p>
<p>“I use approaches that aren’t in the NICE guidelines at all. Er I do what I see to be effective,” said Morgan.</p>
<p>“Well I, well I certainly wouldn’t advertise what I do to the managers,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“For me, they’re guidelines, rather than somebody telling me what to do,” said Kim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of what’s driving these psychologists’ concerns is that the influence of NICE guidelines has seen the emergence of single-approach therapists, such as CBT-therapists, who are cheaper for the NHS to employ but who arguably aren’t able to offer patients multifaceted, individually tailored care in the way that psychologists can:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… [A]s a clinical psychologist I will be bringing in lots of different therapy kind of techniques and models and formulations from different erm models of psychological therapies, so I don’t think it’s as purist as maybe NICE guidelines might encourage people to think,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“[Integration is] seen as weak or criticism, and actually I think that’s our biggest strength, and that’s what I mean by we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. As psychologists it would be nice if we actually worked to maintain our identity and what we have that’s special to offer,” said Jan .</p></blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on the interviews, Court and his colleagues said that there seemed to be a “perverse incentive” within the NHS for clinical psychologists “to claim to be doing protocol-driven, single-model therapy whilst actually conducting much more sophisticated interventions, drawing on a range of psychological theory and based on an individualised, formulation co-constructed with the service user.” The researchers also argued that their results highlight the need for NHS managers to allow clinical psychologists (and other skilled clinicians) flexibility in choosing the care they offer to service users, rather than being overly prescriptive. However, to play devil’s advocate, I would suggest the guidelines can help correct for <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/28/the-mistakes-that-lead-therapists-to-infer-psychotherapy-was-effective-when-it-wasnt/">the difficulty clinicians can have in judging whether their favoured approach is effective or not</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to know how representative these findings are of clinical psychologists more generally, and how much the research authors’ own feelings influenced the interviews and how they were interpreted. Court and his colleagues acknowledged the subjectivity in their research – “this study makes no claims that the findings are objective,” they wrote. It’s perhaps worth noting too that there was nothing random about the recruitment process – four of the interviewees were already known to Court (though they weren’t colleagues), and he chose others based on a pre-interview screening process to try to reflect a mix of opinions. Also, Court’s supervisor and co-author Anne Cook has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/17/were-not-surprised-half-our-psychologist-colleagues-are-depressed">written publicly</a> about the adverse effects of treatment time limits and targets on clinical psychologists, and it seems at least plausible that her own concerns about NICE guidelines may have influenced the tone of the paper.</p>
<p>That said, this research provides an important and rare insight into what some NHS clinical psychologists think of the official guidelines that are meant to be guiding how they work.</p>

            Retraction Watch reports on an initiative by the microbiology journal mSphere. Under the new system, the editors no longer take responsibility for inviting peer reviewers to evaluate each manuscript. Instead, the would-be authors are expected to find two reviewers themselves, and to submit the reviews along with their paper.

mSphere call this approach 'author-initiated peer review', but I like to think of it as the "Pick-Your-Own" system.

            <p>Arduino is a fantastic microcontroller platform, but the IDE can feel quite limiting once you go beyond “Hello world” projects. If you’ve outgrown the Arduino IDE, consider <a href="http://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 750px;"><img alt="PlatformIO IDE for IoT development" height="689" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.platformio.org/images/platformio-ide-for-atom.c6645c5e.png" width="750" />PlatformIO IDE for IoT development screenshot, from <a href="http://platformio.org/" rel="nofollow">http://platformio.org/</a></figure>
<p>PlatformIO is a a powerful IDE for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with some great features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports Arduino, ARM Cortex, and many other IoT platforms</li>
<li>Full-featured code editor based on Atom with tab-completion, inline help, multiple cursors, refactoring, the works</li>
<li>Supports Build, Upload, Unit Test actions with continuous integration options</li>
<li>Build files with sane library management</li>
<li>Serial port monitor with automatic restart</li>
</ul>
<p>These features really shine when you start building more complex projects.</p>
<p>Here I showcase how you can build and upload a simple multi-Arduino device project that would be a pain to manage otherwise.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Let’s say you want to build a system build out of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sender – an Arduino device with some attached sensors – captures information from the environment, and beams it into the air via XBee, Bluetooth, plain-jane RF, etc.</li>
<li>a receiver – a second Arduino device that reads the information from the first, remote Arduino device and actuates, e.g. some motors or servos</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arduino IDE is not well-adapted to this kind of problem, because it uses a paradigm where one sketch = one device. If you want to work on a project that uses two devices you have to use two separate .ino sketches, running in two separate processes. You have to manage these two projects separately, test and upload them on different schedules. Then what if you need to share some common headers, like, let’s say, a .h file which contains an encryption key for RF? That’s not straightforward at all.</p>
<p>PlatformIO makes it easy to work with multiple devices.</p>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p><a href="http://platformio.org/platformio-ide">Install the PlaformIO IDE</a>, fire up Atom, and start a new project. Add whatever device you want to support – I’m using the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-rfm69hcw-module?view=all">Adafruit Feather</a>, specifically the model which has an RFM69 RF module on it for radio communication. This will initialize a minimalist project with nothing in it:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Now create a new file under src/sender/blink.cpp, which will contain Arduino’s version of Hello world, the blink sketch:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// The Hello world of the Arduino world! Blink at 5Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your initial Arduino to a USB port, and hit Upload from the PlatformIO menu.</p>
<p>That’s it – you should get some output to the effect that the code was successfully built, your code should be uploaded to your Arduino, and the builtin LED should start flashing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hint: You can access all the build actions – build, upload, and test – using the F7 key.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Static address</h1>
<p>Use the PlatformIO &gt; List Serial Ports menu item to find which serial port your Arduino device is using. On Linux, the name of the device you be of the form `/dev/ttyACMXXX`; Macs instead have the form `/dev/USBXXX`. Now open the platformio.ini file at the root of your project, which was auto-generated for you. Mine looks like:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
</pre>
<p>We’re going to start by giving it a meaningful name, and assigning it to a specific upload port:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
upload_port=/dev/ttyACM0
</pre>
<p>Save the file, and upload again, you should get exactly the same result. While it seems like we haven’t done much, we’ve created the skeleton for our future build file for multiple devices. When you work on bigger project, you will also manage dependencies, and many other aspects of the project, through <a href="http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/projectconf.html">the platformio.ini file</a>.</p>
<h1>Two devices</h1>
<p>To extend this to two devices, it’s very straightforward. Make a new file in the project, src/receiver/blink.cpp. Set the interval for this one so it blinks more slowly:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// Blink this pup at 1Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your second device, list serial devices through the menu, and find out the name of the new device, e.g. /dev/ttyACM1. Now we’re ready to update the platformio.ini file:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; +&lt;sender/&gt; -&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM0

[env:feather32u4_receiver]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; -&lt;sender/&gt; +&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM1
</pre>
<p>We’ve added a second section corresponding to the second device. The important thing here is the addition of src_filter, which specifies which files are to be compiled and sent to each device. We specified – and + to specifically include and exclude subdirectories of the source folder.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>When you hit F7 this time, you’ll see many more options — you can Build, or Upload, which will send both sketches one after the other to their respective Arduinos. You can also build and upload for a specific environment, in which case only one Arduino will be updated.</p>
<p>If you upload both sketches, you will see your designated sender blink fast, and the designated receiver blink slowly.</p>
<h1>Shared files</h1>
<p>With this structure, it’s very easy to share a file between the two sketches. Simply create the src/constants.h file, with content, for example:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#DEFINE secret_key "OMGSOSECRet"
</pre>
<p>Then #include it in both the cpp files. Easy.</p>
<h1>Optional: static addresses</h1>
<p>The scheme here will work as long as you remember to reconnect your Arduinos in the right order — otherwise they’ll be assigned different TTY addresses and you’ll be uploading each sketch to the wrong place. To avoid this, you can change your udev rules to assign a static /dev address, e.g. `/dev/receiver`, to a given Arduino. <a href="http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/">Follow this tutorial here</a>, and update your platformio.ini file accordingly. It’s a bit of work but it will pay off later in the hassle you save.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=xcorr.net&amp;blog=3084329&amp;post=5903&amp;subd=xcorr&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

In today’s post, we review our 2016 accomplishments in this area and the progress we’ve made toward <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/" target="_blank">our goals</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ORCID Implementation</strong></p>
<p>In January, PLOS, eLife, the Royal Society and other major publishers developed and signed an <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter" target="_blank">Open Letter</a></strong> committing to follow best practices when collecting, processing and displaying ORCID iDs. Signatories further agreed to begin requiring by year end that each corresponding author associate their name with an ORCID iD and 15 signatories have already implemented this policy. As of December 7 this is now also PLOS policy—corresponding authors on manuscripts coming in to either of our submission systems (Editorial Manager or Aperta™) must provide an authenticated ORCID iD.</p>
<p>In preparing for the launch of this requirement, we tackled both technical and operational hurdles. But there were – and still are – behavioral changes needed. PLOS began capturing ORCID iDs in Editorial Manager in 2014. By the beginning of 2016 there were more than 27,000 authenticated iDs in our database. Throughout this year, we have actively engaged with our authors, editors and reviewers to encourage sign-ups; in addition to email campaigns and messaging in the submission system we have posted an <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">informational page</a></strong> on our web site, updated our <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-identification" target="_blank">author instructions</a></strong> and provided <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how-to videos</a></strong> to assist our contributors.</p>
<p>As of this week, we have upwards of 54,000 authenticated ORCID iDs, more than doubling the count in less than a year. We still have a long way to go, however, as there are many more in our database who have yet to register!</p>
<p><strong>How PLOS Uses ORCID IDs</strong></p>
<p>From early 2016, we have been passing authors’ iDs on published articles through to Crossref with our metadata deposits. Crossref, in turn, communicates that information to ORCID; if the author has agreed to allow for updates their ORCID profile is enhanced to include the new publication. This <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/26/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level" target="_blank">auto-update</a></strong> function makes it possible for authors to maintain their records going forward without having to take action. It’s vitally important that authors provide their permission for this process to work.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #339966;">Are you an author who’s provided an ORCID iD to us and published a PLOS article during 2016? Are you wondering why credit isn’t showing up in your ORCID profile? <span style="color: #333399;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" style="color: #333399;" target="_blank">Watch our short video</a></span> to see how to ensure you’ve given the needed permission.</span></h3>
<p><strong>CRediT Implementation</strong></p>
<p>While ORCID allows us to know and unambiguously credit WHO participated in published articles, CRediT goes a step further and allows us to provide attribution for WHAT those individuals did in relation to the articles. Such attribution improves the ability of institutions and funders to more accurately evaluate researchers based on their actual contributions to published works, rather than by the journals in which those articles appear.</p>
<p>While PLOS has for many years required contributions for each of the named authors to any submitted work, in 2016 we <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">adopted the CRediT taxonomy</a></strong> of contributions. CRediT is a community-developed open standard intended to replace over time the many disparate lists – or free-text – that publishers have been using for this purpose. <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-contributions" target="_blank">More information</a></strong> is provided in our instructions for authors.</p>
<p>We are gathering data on how the CRediT taxonomy is being used by our authors and will be analyzing and sharing that out in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Progress in these two areas – uniquely identifying and crediting authors and gathering standardized author contributions – are major steps along the path of providing improved attribution and transparency in scholarly publishing. PLOS will continue to provide or adopt new tools and services that help accelerate the pace and transparency of scientific research and will <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/where-next-for-plos-working-together-to-make-waves-in-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">continue to collaborate with others</a></strong> to establish ways to speed publication, improve the author experience and advance standards for reporting and reproducing research.</p>

<p>It’s one of the simplest, most evidence-backed pieces of advice you can give to someone who’s looking to attract a partner – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/13/episode-1-dating-attraction/">wear red</a>. Many studies, most of them involving men rating women’s appearance, have shown that wearing red clothing increases attractiveness and sex appeal. The reasons are thought to be traceable to our evolutionary past – red displays in the animal kingdom also often indicate sexual interest and availability – complemented by the cultural connotations of red with passion and sex.</p>
<p>But nothing, it seems, is straightforward in psychology any more. A team of Dutch and British researchers has just published <a href="http://evp.sagepub.com/content/14/4/1474704916673841.full">three attempts</a> to replicate the red effect in the open-access journal <em>Evolutionary Psychology</em>, including testing whether the effect is more pronounced in a short-term mating context, which would be consistent with the idea that red signals sexual availability. However, not only did the research not uncover an effect of mating context, all three experiments also failed to demonstrate any effect of red on attractiveness whatsoever. <span id="more-15215"></span></p>
<p>The simple picture that red increases attractiveness, especially in the eyes of men viewing women, had already been muddied by <a href="http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/articles/652/">a large study published earlier this year</a> that tried to extend the red effect to the context of waitress tipping, but which found, contrary to expectations, that men gave smaller tips to female servers wearing red. Also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22947805">other</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558822">recent</a> papers found the red-attractiveness effect when red was compared with some colours but not others.</p>
<p>For the new research, Leonard Peperkoorn and his colleagues began by asking 206 young Dutch men (all were heterosexual except for two who described themselves as bisexual) to judge the attractiveness of a woman pictured on a dating site, as well as how much they wanted to have sex with her. The woman was shown wearing either a red, black or white shirt. Some men looked at the woman in the context of using the dating site to find a one-night stand, the others in the context of searching for a long-term partner. Regardless of context, the woman was not rated more attractive or sexually desirable when wearing red. Moreover, the men said afterwards that the colour of her clothing was the least significant factor in their judgments. In a second replication attempt, the same negative results were also found with a sample of nearly 200 heterosexual American men.</p>
<p>Next the researchers attempted a more direct replication of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100299X">a prior study</a> that demonstrated the red effect in the context of men recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website rating a woman as more sexually receptive when she was seen wearing a red shirt as compared with a white one. Importantly, Peperkoorn and his colleagues obtained the exact same study materials used in that earlier research and recruited 433 men via Amazon to rate the same woman – a sample size 17 times larger than that used in the original study. However, this time, the men did not rate the woman’s sexual receptivity (based on survey items like “this person is interested in sex”) any differently when she was wearing red than when she was wearing white, and this was true across different age groups and regardless of the men’s current relationship status.</p>
<p>Just as it is wise not to place too much faith in the findings from single studies, we should also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/07/episode-8-can-we-trust-psychological-studies/">interpret failed replications with caution</a>. These new null results do not mean there is no red effect, but they do raise questions about its robustness, and the possibility that there might have a been a bias in past research to publish positive results. A generous interpretation is that the red effect could be more significant in real interactions than in lab-based research using static photos, because the colour might influence the wearer to behave more flirtatiously, for example.</p>
<p>However Peperkoorn and his team made their own newfound scepticism apparent. “The lack of evidence for a red effect in our three experiments … leads us to question the robustness of the red effect in human mate preferences,” they said. They further pointed out that past evidence has tended to be based on small studies and they encouraged others to perform replication attempts with larger samples. “We argue … that if red has an effect on human mate preferences, then it is likely to be small,” they concluded.</p>

<p>Alcohol consumption ranks 5th among the 20 leading risk factors for global burden of disease and <em>BMC Public Health</em> has published an array of articles this year on harmful drinking. Theresa Marteau et al. carried out a study in an eating and drinking establishment in Cambridge, England, which reports the effects of wine glass size on wine sales. During the study, the size of wine glasses were <img alt="Wine" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8230" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/wine-300x201.jpg" width="300" />changed at fortnightly intervals and, over a 16-week period, the establishment alternated between the standard 300ml wine glass, to the larger 370ml and smaller 250ml glasses. Data showed that the volume of wine purchased was nearly 10 percent higher when sold in larger glasses compared to standard-sized glasses. Interestingly, Marteau et al. did not see the opposite effect when they switched to smaller wine glasses.  The results indicate that avoiding the use of large wine glasses could reduce the amount that people drink. However, more research is required to confirm the effect and, should this suggest glass size might be an effective target for intervention, the next step would be to explore how this might be implemented.</p>

<p><span class="AuthorName">Economic recessions are known to affect people’s health and wellbeing. </span><span class="AuthorName">Diana Frasquilho et al. have carried out a systematic review which looks at the recent evidence of the possible association between economic recessions and mental health outcomes. They found that, in general, evidence on the impact of economic crises and recessions on mental health is accruing, but comprehensive studies are lacking. Although periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behavior, most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences. Diana Frasquilho explains more about the review’s findings <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/09/mental-health-outcomes-times-economic-recession/">here.</a></span></p>

Surprisingly, the authors’ results reveal that groups one might presume to be the least psychologically motivated to look for this information, young adults and smokers, were more likely to say that they had previously looked for it. Furthermore, more than 80% of U.S. smokers reported intending to eventually quit smoking, suggesting that many smokers are in the contemplation stage of behavior change and would therefore benefit from greater access to constituent information. The researchers also asked respondents whether they had heard that each of 4 constituents are in cigarette smoke and found that, with the exception of nicotine, most people were largely unaware of what chemicals are present in tobacco products.</p>

<p>Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have a close and complex relationship which warrants research sometimes looking at these major public health problems in conjunction. Jamie Brown et al. looked at whether, at a population level, smokers who have recently attempted to quit smoking are more likely than other smokers to report lower alcohol consumption and trying to reduce their drinking.  A total of 31,878 adults in England were surveyed between March 2014 and September 2015 and the researchers found that smokers who reported attempting to stop within the last week had lower levels of alcohol consumption, especially bingeing, and were less likely to be classified as having higher risk alcohol consumption compared with those who did not report an attempt to quit smoking in the last week. Results indicate that smokers in England may be following best-practice advice to restrict their alcohol consumption during a smoking cessation attempt. However, due to the nature of the study, it is not clear whether the effects seen are due to reverse causation: ie, that the association between quitting and consumption is actually driven by people with lower alcohol consumption being more likely to attempt to quit smoking. In either case, the study findings have important implications for policy evaluation and justify a coordinated strategy on alcohol and tobacco control.</p>

Jing Ma et al. explored live-broadcast suicide in Chinese emerging adults and collected data on the suicide incidents, stages/process, participants and their behaviors. Findings revealed that important information can be obtained from accounts of these incidents, which could contribute to a better understanding of suicidal people, those who encourage suicidal behaviors in others, and, most importantly, how suicide could be prevented in an online environment.</p>

<p>In this study, Simon Moore and colleagues examine for the first time how people judge their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking whilst they are intoxicated in social drinking environments. The authors carried out breath alcohol testing of 1,862 people and asked a subset of them about their perceptions of their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking. Their results show that people base judgements regarding their drinking on how their level of intoxication ranks relative to that of others of the same gender around them, not on their actual levels of intoxication. These findings have implications for strategies looking at increasing the numbers of sober people in night time environments.</p>

Carri Westgarth and co-authors carried out a study examining the demographic and behavioral factors that contribute towards owners reporting having a strong sense of encouragement and motivation to walk provided by their dogs. They found that factors such as owning a larger dog, having an increased level of attachment to their dog, knowing their dog enjoys going for a walk, believing walking keeps dogs healthy and having high social support from family to go walking, were positively associated with both outcomes ‘dog encouragement to walk’ and ‘dog motivation to walk’. These factors may be targeted in future interventions to increase and maintain physical activity levels of both people and pets.</p>

<p>Yvonne Kelly and colleagues have found that UK 11-year-olds whose parents drink heavily are almost twice as likely to drink themselves than if their parents are non-drinkers – and particularly if their mother rather than their father is a heavy or regular binge drinker. Children who said their friends drank were also more than four times as likely to drink themselves as those children who had friends who didn’t drink. The researchers carried out an analysis of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 10,498 11-year-olds and results obtained suggest that their perceptions of risk, their expectancies towards alcohol and relationships with their families were independently related to the likelihood of drinking.

<p><img alt="Soda" class="size-medium wp-image-8231 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/soda-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are estimated to arise from agriculture and associated land use change and therefore changing food consumption patterns may contribute substantially to reducing these gas levels. However, in attempting to reduce the consumption of foods with high GHGEs, other unhealthy food products which are low in GHGEs, such as sugar, may be preferred by consumers. In order to promote foods with low GHGEs and, at the same time, mitigate the negative health consequences of choosing low GHGE foods, Adam Briggs et al. modelled the effect on UK non-communicable disease mortality and GHGEs of internalizing the social cost of carbon into the price of food alongside a 20% tax on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). Results of the study indicate that incorporating this cost into food prices has the potential to improve health, reduce GHGEs and raise revenue. Furthermore, the SSBs tax can alleviate negative health consequences. The study, which is the first of its kind, has laid the groundwork for future research which is needed on developing sophisticated price structures to optimize a healthy population diet that is low in GHGEs.</p>

<p>A number of studies have shown that deprived communities suffer substantively greater alcohol-related morbidity and mortality despite reporting average alcohol consumption similar to their richer counterparts. It is unclear why this is true and possible explanations behind the paradox include that deprived populations are exposed to other health challenges that interact with higher levels of alcohol consumption or there may be epidemiologically relevant differences in patterns of consumption and types of alcohol consumed. Mark Bellis et al. sought to assess the hypotheses behind this paradox by carrying out a national telephone survey with English adults. Questions examined factors including: current and historic drinking patterns, combined health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass), and under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special occasion drinking). The researchers found that, among more deprived drinkers, alcohol consumption is more likely to be combined with smoking and poor diet, suggesting a multiplicative effect. The research also identifies higher levels of current and past ‘binge drinking’ among some deprived drinkers, which is known to weaken the protective effects of low consumption on, for example, ischaemic heart disease. James Nicholls, a co-author of this work, explains more about the study’s findings in a blog <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/18/alcohol-harm-paradox-poor-increased-health-risk/">here.</a></p>

<p>There is an increasing amount of evidence connecting mental health and personality traits to coronary heart disease (CHD). Mikko Pänkäläinen et al. carried out an 11-year prospective cohort study and looked at levels of dispositional optimism and pessimism of the participants at baseline. They found that both men and women who died because of CHD were significantly more pessimistic at baseline than the others, whereas optimism did not seem to have any connection with mortality risk. The researchers conclude that, as pessimism levels can be measured easily and non-invasively, this might be a very useful tool together with the other known risk factors to determine the risk of CHD-induced mortality.</p>
