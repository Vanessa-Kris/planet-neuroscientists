A scientist's achievements are often measured in terms of the number of papers they publish (productivity) and how many citations those papers get (impact). These 'bibliometric indicators' are widely derided but they have proven remarkably stubborn.



Now, in a new preprint on bioRxiv, researchers Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström propose a new metric that, they say, could measure another important researcher characteristic: independence.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>The phrase “sexual objectification” began popping up <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=sexual+objectification&amp;year_start=1950&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%25253B%25252Csexual%252520objectification%25253B%25252Cc0">only 50 years ago</a>, but it’s now ubiquitous, reflecting our concern that seeing someone sexually amounts to perceiving them as eye candy or a piece of meat. More recently, psychologists and neuroscientists have gathered evidence that sexualisation can literally lead us to perceive people less as whole humans and more as an assemblage of parts – the same way that the mind normally processes objects.</p>
<p>But the picture is complicated by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218775690">new work</a> published in <i>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</i> from a team mainly drawn from the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Their experiments on the impact of various forms of sexualisation on the perception of the body find that objectification does not necessarily follow.</p>
<p><span id="more-34547"></span></p>
<p>This study relies on the discovery first made <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1969-12269-001">nearly 50 years ago</a> that when human faces and bodies are presented upside-down, it is particularly hard for us to perceive them in the same holistic way we do when we look at them the right-way up (a phenomenon known as the “inversion effect”). Supporting the concept of objectification, evidence from this decade shows that inverted sexualised bodies (for example, wearing scant clothing in a provocative pose) do not trigger the inversion effect, suggesting that we process them more like we process objects – by scrutinising their individual parts, rather than holistically.</p>
<p>To break down exactly what about sexualisation drives the switch from humanising to objectifying perception, Philippe Bernard and his team measured volunteers’ brainwaves, in particular looking for a negative spike in brain activity called the N170 that is known to be a marker of the inversion effect (the N170 is much larger when we view flipped human bodies versus upright ones, but shows little difference in size when we view flipped versus upright objects).</p>
<p>In their first experiment, Bernard’s team focused on an obvious way to sexualise a person, by reducing their clothing. Twenty-one participants (average age 22, and in all experiments a balance of genders, with no gendered effects observed) viewed pictures of males and females with pixellated faces wearing  black jeans and shirts or black swim-trunks/bikinis. The change in N170 caused by inverting the pictures was similar for both scantily-clad and well-covered bodies – in other words, at a neural level there was no evidence for greater objectification of the more sexualised models.</p>
<p>It was in further experiments that neural evidence of objectification emerged, once researchers introduced pictures of models engaged in sexually suggestive postures (see image above). Regardless of their amount of clothing, when the models posed suggestively inversion did not lead to a change in the N170, which means that they were being perceived more like objects.</p>
<p>Can it really be true that, without provocative posing, images showing a lot of skin did not provoke any sexualisation? While the study’s primary focus was on inversion effects, the researchers also looked at the overall size of the N170 in the different conditions because more sexualised images are known to trigger a larger N170. When the participants viewed bodies that were less clothed, particularly women’s bodies, the N170 was larger. So it seems that although seeing a lot of skin <i>doesn’t</i> objectify, it does generate sexual associations.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, suggestive posturing is a volitional act that we make in the moment, one that is intended to express “see what’s on offer”. That people respond to such invitations by checking out the wares rather than the person seems to me to reflect the response working as intended. In contrast, skin exposure need not be any kind of signal to a viewer – we expose skin when we wash, swim or stay cool (or just because we want to).  That seeing skin can rouse some sexual feeling, but doesn’t automatically make us see the person any less, seems to me to be a fairly decent and respectful way for our perceptual and cognitive architecture to be put together.</p>
<p>I should leaven this optimistic take by recognising that these actions take place in a cultural context. In the hunt for ways to titillate and capture attention, media and advertising have exploited the sexual and objectifying qualities of the provocative pose, in a way that inundates and threatens to normalise this way of viewing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, the way you pose is at your discretion, a consensual act. But where people feel pressure to actively signal sexuality, whether on Instagram or on a night out, the choice is less clearly free. And individuals who through inclination or conditioning are eager to objectify may not require suggestiveness from their target in order to do so; more work is needed to shed light on this. What this study tells us is simple: you can be seen as sexual, without being seen as an object.</p>

<h4>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) have discovered a new role for inhibition, regulating how and when motor learning is acquired in the cerebellum.</h4>
<p>Almost everyone is familiar with the unique mixture of surprise and confusion that occurs after making a mistake during an everyday movement. It’s a fairly startling experience – stumbling on a step or accidentally missing your mouth when taking a drink. These actions are so ingrained that any mishap is almost always followed by the question “Why in the world did I just do that?” This momentary bewilderment is due to the fact that our brains have an extraordinary capacity for learning skilled movements. So much so that our routine actions, such as climbing stairs, become second nature. For the most part we don’t even consciously think about them…that is until we make a mistake.</p>
<p>While mistakes (errors in motor performance) don’t occur very frequently once we’ve picked something up, they are the tool used by the brain to evaluate and adjust our movements in hopes that next time, we won’t stumble or spill our drinks so easily. As the saying goes “We learn from our mistakes,” but how do our brains turn the motor errors we make into meaningful and reliable learning?</p>
<p>In a recent publication in Neuron, researchers from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), have discovered part of the answer to this longstanding question. Uncovering a surprising new role for inhibition in the cerebellum, Dr. Christie’s team has broadened the current understanding of neural computation and provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms and principles underlying motor learning.</p>
<p>“Learning isn’t a monolithic event, that either happens or doesn’t,” describes Dr. Christie. “It’s a much more complex behavior that can vary in duration, magnitude and direction. Our findings demonstrate that in the cerebellum, motor learning can occur along a continuum and what seems to be the key, is the influence of an inhibitory cell class called molecular layer interneurons.”</p>
<p>An anatomically unique region of the brain, the cerebellum plays a critically important role in regulating motor control and coordination. Despite its relatively small size- only about 10% of the entire brain- the cerebellum houses roughly half of our total neurons, around 50 billion. While receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single type of specialized neuron called a Purkinje cell. These cells receive two well characterized excitatory inputs and a lesser studied inhibitory input, helping to guide motor behavior and facilitate learning.</p>

Below are averaged test postsynaptic potentials evoked by parallel fiber stimulation from the same cell before and after the pairing protocol. (D) During the stimulus protocol, molecular layer interneurons were activated following the parallel fiber tetanus.</p></div>
<p>“Thousands of excitatory inputs by parallel fibers, set the stage for Purkinje cell activation by providing sensory and motor context for actions,” describes Audrey Bonnan, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Christie Lab and one of the publication’s first authors. “It’s these inputs that activate Purkinje cells and maintain normal coordination and movement. When we make a mistake however, a second excitatory input from a climbing fiber, arrives simultaneously and delivers an instructive signal. This new information detailing motor error, weakens the synaptic connections between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells; producing a change in behavior and ultimately allowing for learning to occur. But the function of inhibitory inputs in this process, was still largely unknown.”</p>
<p>This alteration in synaptic strength, known as synaptic plasticity, is thought to be the mechanistic correlate of learning. Uncovering how inhibitory interneurons influence plasticity is the first step in gaining insights into their role in motor learning. To address this question, the team performed simultaneous electrical stimulation of the excitatory inputs encoding contexts and those encoding signaling errors, simulating the events that occur during learning. Using electrophysiology to record the output of the Purkinje cell, the researchers then precisely activated inhibitory interneurons by use of a light-based approach for neural stimulation (optogenetics). This approach benefited from a collaboration with MPFI’s Taniguchi lab that allowed optogenetic targeting of only molecular layer interneurons.</p>
<p>“We found that inhibition allows for an entire spectrum of outcomes,” notes Dr. Christie. “Without inhibition, Purkinje cells showed the expected synaptic weakening caused by co-activation of parallel fibers and climbing fibers. By strongly activating molecular layer interneurons, there was a complete reversal of plasticity where synapses were strengthened with the addition of inhibition. Surprisingly with weak activation of these interneurons, plasticity seemed to be negated where no change occurred at all.”</p>
<p>Taking the investigation one step further, inhibition produced a similar type of reversal on learning behavior. Using dual color optogenetics, the MPFI researchers evaluated the effect of molecular layer activation during adaptive vestibulo-ocular reflex or VOR, which helps to maintain a stable gaze by moving the eyes in the opposite direction of head movement. With training, the VOR can undergo learned adaptation where eye movement during the reflex increases (gain increase). Consistent with plasticity findings, strong activation of MLIs produced a complete reversal in learning of VOR, causing dramatically less eye movement (gain decrease). With weak activation of MLIs, little to no change occurred, matching animals with untrained VORs.</p>
<p>“Inhibition seems to dramatically broaden the range with which cells can respond to stimuli,” explains Dr. Christie. “Instead of the brain having only two options -learning or not learning- there can be a tremendous amount of variation in between. For example, learning a little or learning a lot. It’s like black and white versus shades of gray, where the shades of gray allow for a greater amount of behavioral flexibility.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christie notes that the work was a tremendous effort between first authors Matt Rowan, Ph.D., now an Assistant Professor at Emory University; Audrey Bonnan, Ph.D., and Ke Zhang, a graduate student in the International Max Planck Research School for Brain and Behavior, and that their surprising findings have opened up a whole new avenue of inquiry for the future.</p>

<p>Stimulants available on prescription such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall">Adderall</a> improve cognitive functioning as well as attention in people with ADHD, but many students without this condition also take them, believing that they will act as “smart drugs” and boost their cognition, and so their academic performance. The limited research to date into whether this is actually the case has produced mixed results. A new double-blind <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2226-4787/6/3/58">pilot study</a> of healthy US college students, published in <i>Pharmacy</i>, found that though Adderall led to minor improvements in attention, it actually impaired working memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34522"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, from the US and Iceland, recruited 13 healthy college students who were given a 30 mg dose of Adderall in capsule form before one test session, and a placebo capsule before another (adults with ADHD who have been prescribed Adderall take anywhere between 5 and 60 mg per day). The sessions lasted five and a half hours. During this time, the participants completed six neurocognitive tasks (timed to occur when the drug’s effect would be at its peak – between 90 and 210 minutes after taking the capsule). Every half hour, the students also reported how much they were feeling any drug effects and their emotional state, and their heart rate and blood pressure were measured.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The neurocognitive measures assessed working memory, memory for increasingly complex stories, attention and vigilance, memory of past cognition and ability to self-regulate, and also reading. The students also indicated whether they thought the drug had positively or negatively affected their performance on the tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results showed that the drug boosted levels of positive emotion and raised heart rate and blood pressure. It also led to slight improvements on the tests of attention and focus. But it worsened performance on one of the measures of working memory (recall of a string of digits), and also participants’ perceptions of their past cognitive and self-regulation functioning. It had no effect on reading performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“While improving attention skills, [Adderall] may simultaneously degrade students’ confidence in their abilities to problem solve, complete tasks and interact with others,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27690507">large numbers of students who report taking stimulants</a>, these results suggest that while the drugs might have a slight impact on attention, they probably won’t do much to enhance their academic performance (while Adderall can address a neurocognitive deficit – in people with ADHD – it does not seem to lead to the same improvements in already healthy people). And, besides the hit to working memory, there are other recognised downsides to taking such drugs: common side effects of Adderall include headaches, digestive problems and insomnia. But this was a pilot study, and the sample size was certainly small. More work in the area is clearly needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It may be difficult for others to understand because, in general, women with children are considered blessed and are likely to be surrounded by friends and family. In this blog, I will address some of the reasons for this loneliness and discuss <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0625-x?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Social_media_mums" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the results of a survey</a> we conducted with new mothers in Japan and what the findings say about reducing loneliness.</p>
<p>Japan is a country with one of the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/japan/Gender2017-JPN-en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest levels of gender inequality</a> <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2017/results-and-analysis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the world</a>. Parenting tends to be regarded as a woman’s job. Moreover, due to the increase of nuclear families and the decrease of regional connections, loneliness in mothers raising children is becoming more of a concern.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors that affect loneliness</strong></h3>
<p>Loneliness is influenced by both personal and social factors. Personal factors include introverted personalities, low self-esteem or attachment styles. Attachment theory assumes that individuals construct relationships with others around them. Their actions are influenced by whether the other person is available as well as by their own estimations of whether they are accepted. This theory led to the formation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_working_model_of_attachment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Internal Working Model of attachment</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, social factors include social networks and support. Mothers raising children can now obtain a large amount of information on medical care and child health via the internet. The current generation of women who experience pregnancy, childbirth, and childrearing use social network sites (SNSs) on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To date, no study has examined how SNS use affects loneliness in mothers raising young children. It is important to assess the actual level of loneliness experienced by such mothers, and to identify social and personal factors associated with this. With this in mind, we aimed to identify predictors of loneliness among mothers raising young children in Japan, with special reference to SNS use.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0625-x?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Social_media_mums" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new study</a>, we conducted an anonymous self-reported questionnaire survey of mothers raising children under the age of 3 years in Nagahama City, Japan, from July 28 to September 29, 2014. Among a total of 638 respondents, data from 523 mothers were analyzed.</p>
<p>We asked the mothers for information on basic characteristics such as age, marital status, subjective economic status, health status, and education level. We also asked them about loneliness, using the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; social networks, both online and offline; and types of communication devices and information sources used.</p>
<h3><strong>Which mothers are less lonely?</strong></h3>
<p>All participants used communication devices, particularly smartphones. Our results show a U-shaped relationship between the time spent on smartphones and loneliness. Not having a smartphone and very little smartphone use (&lt;0.5 hours) were associated with higher levels of loneliness. Longer smartphone use (2-3 hours, &gt;3 hours) was also associated with higher levels of loneliness. This suggests there is an optimal range of smartphone use which may be associated with lower levels of loneliness.</p>
<p>We found that low support from SNS friends significantly correlated with high levels of loneliness among mothers raising young children. Loneliness tended to be lower as personal networks grew, both those created through SNS and traditional networks of family and friends. This indicates the potential of SNS to reduce loneliness among mothers.</p>
<p>The present study showed that SNS use may reduce loneliness among mothers raising young children. The beneficial role of bidirectional information support, including SNS, provided by public or commercial services warrants further research.</p>
<p>Although the results of our study may not be generalizable, as the questionnaire survey was conducted among mothers who came for regular health check-ups for their children during a specified time period, loneliness in motherhood is a global concern and we hope our findings will be helpful to other settings and countries.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/15/glioblastoma-treatment-new-promising-developments/">Glioblastoma Treatment: New Promising Developments</a></h4>

<p>Cancer is one of the top leading causes of mortality globally. The growing prevalence of the disease has to do with both our changing environment and longer lifespan. It is said that if all humans lived for 200 years, most people would develop cancer at some time in life. Thus, finding a cure for cancer is vital for longevity</p>
<p>Cancer is the unregulated growth of one or another type of cells. In the case of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/">glioblastoma</a>, it is the unchecked growth of glial cells in the brain. Fortunately, brain cancers are less common in comparison than those found in other parts of the body. However, when they occur, they are difficult to treat.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/01/06/mighty-microglia-the-brains-immune-cells-could-be-the-key-to-treating-brain-diseases/">Glial cells</a> are a group of cells that have varied functions in the brain. In the past, they were thought to merely be glue cells that help to keep neurons at the place. But now it is understood that glial cells have many other functions, and help to maintain brain health. They do the cleaning, repair, and maintenance, and also play a role in the local immunity.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/">glioblastoma</a> is a rare form of cancer—its occurrence is about 10 in 100,000. Among the brain cancers, however, glioblastomas account for 15% of all cases. It is one of the most aggressive types of brain cancers. Thus, even with the best of treatment, most patients will barely survive one and a half years. Very small numbers of patients can expect to live longer than three years, and less than 5% live up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Despite the progress in the treatment and management of other forms of cancer, only a few <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/">positive glioblastoma treatment developments</a> were reported in the last decades. For more than half a century, treatment of brain cancers remains based on surgery and chemotherapy. Usually, the surgeon would remove the affected part of the brain, and then they would try to suppress the remaining cancer cell with highly toxic chemotherapeutic agents. This approach has not been working well for glioblastoma.</p>
<p>These days, thanks to advancements in personalized medicine and a better understanding of cellular physiology and genetics, newer cancer treatments are being developed. Instead of mere surgical removal or the use of toxic drugs, researchers are learning ways to control various cellular mechanisms. Using these novel methods, it is possible now to force the brain tumor into remission or train the brain’s immune system to work against cancer.</p>
<h3>Exploiting what forces cancer into remission</h3>
<p>Genes and various factors control every part of cellular life. Thus, cells grow in a particular fashion, behave in a specific way and, when required, go through <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/02/06/what-stem-cells-need-to-survive-in-the-brain/">programmed cell death</a>. In the case of glial cells, this programmed cell death is called anoikis. Further, to keep the brain functioning, these supportive cells also engage in autophagy. Autophagy is a process that helps to keep the brain clear of debris and unnecessary components.</p>
<p>Autophagy can be both protective and dangerous to brain cells. Autophagy helps cancerous glioma stem cells resist anoikis. Autophagy is now known to be regulated by the MDA-9/Syntenin gene. Researchers have found that when the MDA-9/Syntenin gene is blocked, the glioma stem cells lose their protective ability and succumb to programmed death (i.e., anoikis).</p>
<p>Further, researchers found that MDA-9/Syntenin gene suppresses epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Excessive EGFR signaling has been found to be associated with brain cancer/glioblastoma. EGFR is protective against excessive autophagy or programmed cell death.</p>
<p>Scientists realized that when the MDA-9/Syntenin gene is blocked, EGFR cannot regulate protective autophagy, and more widespread death of cancer cells ensues. Now, researchers want to use this feature in a controlled manner to kill the cancer cells.</p>
<p>At present, this approach is being tested in laboratory models of tumor cells and in mouse models. Initial results seem to be encouraging. Suppression of the MDA-9/Syntenin gene in mouse models led to higher survival rates.</p>
<p>Researchers are confident that in the near future they will be able to find safer ways to suppress the MDA-9/Syntenin gene in humans and then start trials on people diagnosed with glioblastoma.</p>
<h3>Training immune system to destroy cancer cells</h3>
<p>This is another approach towards the treatment of various types of cancers. Clinical research has already shown the efficacy of this approach in glioblastoma and many other types of cancers. This approach involves creating an individualized or personal vaccine for each patient with glioblastoma. The initial human trials have already shown a better survival rate.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating a vaccine against cancer, one size does not fit all. The reason is simple; each cancer patient differs genetically. This difference in each cancer patient is linked to the fact that cancers develop due to different mutations across individuals. It means that all patients with glioblastoma have slightly different types of tumor. Therefore, one single vaccine would not work.</p>
<p>The answer to these patient-specific cancerous mutations is a personalized vaccine. This vaccine is called DCVax-L. The vaccine is created by extracting cancer cells from individuals and then training the dendritic cells of the immune system to fight against those specific mutations or cancer cells. Each patient who gets this vaccine would first go through the traditional surgical and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/">chemotherapeutic treatments</a>.  Upon completion of these treatments, the patients would receive the vaccines created specifically for them, to prolong life.</p>
<p>Good news is that this method is already in the last stages of development, and it has shown excellent results in a randomized, blind clinical trial. In these trials, the DCVax-L vaccine was given to 232 patients at various sites. This trial has not yet ended, but the initial results clearly show the higher survival rate. Around 30% of those who got this vaccine survived more than 30 months, and one-fourth survived more than 36 months. At present, 32.6% of those enrolled in the trial are still alive, and they are expected to live between 46.5 to 88.2 months. At present, the vaccine is not a curative treatment, but it provides serious benefits in comparison to traditional methods.</p>
<p>It has taken more than two decades to perfect the vaccine, and researchers believe that things will only get better in the future. In the very near future, we can expect to see much higher 5-year survival rates for glioblastoma patients, and that would already mark a big success.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>If you wanted a poster child for the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a> and the controversy it has unleashed within the field of psychology, it would be hard to do much better than Fritz Strack’s findings. In 1988, the German psychologist and his colleagues published <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-25514-001">research</a> that appeared to show that if your mouth is forced into a smile, you become a bit happier, and if it’s forced into a frown, you become a bit sadder. He pulled this off by asking volunteers to view a set of cartoons (paper ones, not animated) while holding a pen in their mouth, either with their teeth (forcing their mouth into a smile), or with their lips (forcing a frown), and to then use the pen in this position to rate how amused they were by the cartoons. The smilers were more amused, and the frowners less so – and best of all, they mostly didn’t discern the true purpose of the experiment, eliminating potential placebo-effect explanations.</p>
<p>This basic idea, that our facial expressions can feed back into our psychological state and behavior, goes back at least as far as Darwin and William James, but “facial feedback”, as it is known, had never been demonstrated in such an elegant and rigorous-seeming manner. Over time, this style of experiment was replicated and expanded upon, and soon it came to be considered a true blockbuster, so famous it found its ways into psychology textbooks, as well as popular books and articles citing it as an example of the unexpectedly subtle ways our bodies and environments can affect us psychologically. Often, facial feedback has been popularised along the lines of <i>Maybe you can smile your way to happiness!</i>, which added an irresistible self-help element that likely helped spread the idea. Either way, it seemed like a genuinely safe and solid psychological finding. That changed rather abruptly in 2016. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34535"></span></p>
<p>That was when a large, multinational replication attempt of the 1988 study, organised by E. J. Wagenmakers of the University of Amsterdam (Strack had bravely volunteered his study for such scrutiny), delivered some <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/01/no-reason-to-smile-another-modern-psychology-classic-has-failed-to-replicate/">surprising results</a> from 17 labs experimenting on almost 2,000 participants: There wasn’t much evidence to support the effect after all. Nine of the labs found the expected effect, albeit in a much weaker form – a difference of just .1 or .2 points, on average, on the nine-point cartoon-amusement rating scale, between the smilers and frowners, as compared to an average difference of about .8 in the original study – while the rest found an about equally weak effect pointing in the <i>other</i> direction. Summing up the whole episode <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/08/can_smiling_make_you_happier_maybe_maybe_not_we_have_no_idea.html">in an enjoyable and comprehensive Slate article</a>, Daniel Engber writes, “When Wagenmakers put all the findings in a giant pile, the effect averaged out and disappeared. The difference between the smilers and frowners had been reduced to three-hundredths of a rating point, a random blip, a distant echo in the noise.”</p>
<p>But a failed replication is rarely the end of the story, because failed replications often spark further controversy over what they mean – or don’t. This was no exception: Some observers agreed that Wagenmakers and his colleagues’ work really did call the idea of facial feedback into question. Others, including Strack himself, argued that because the researchers had altered certain aspects of the experimental setup, these weren’t “true” replications and thus couldn’t be counted as evidence against the original finding. “I don’t see what we’ve learned,” Strack told Engber. (Strack and Wolfgang Stroebe <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ghaeffel/AllegedCrisis.pdf">published a paper in 2014</a> making this replication-sceptical argument more generally.)</p>
<p>Now, a new paper adds a bit of evidence to the idea that the failure to replicate here might have more to do with methodological issues than with the absence of a real effect. For an <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-16714-001">article published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i></a>, Tom Noah, Yaacov Schul, and Ruth Mayo of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem basically replicated the Wagenmakers teams’ replications, but with a newly introduced independent variable to toggle on or off: the presence of a video camera. As the authors explain, this was one of the key differences between the original studies and the replications: in the former, there was no video camera watching the participants, but in the latter there was (the footage was used to check whether the participants had followed the instructions correctly). <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-58542-015">Strack himself</a> had cited the presence of the cameras as one reason he was skeptical of the failed replications.</p>
<p>Noah and her colleagues write that there are theoretical reasons to believe that the feeling of being observed – by a camera, in this case – could have certain effects that might disrupt facial feedback. Specifically, under such circumstances “people adopt an external perspective of themselves… [and] tend to neglect internal information.” In other words, the act of smiling might cause certain internal cues that in turn cause an uptick in happiness or amusement, but the feeling of being observed could short-circuit this connection.</p>
<p>So in half the Noah team’s (re-)replications, there was a video camera. In the other half, their wasn’t one. And sure enough, there was a good-sized statistically significant effect in the no-camera group – a .83 difference between the smiling and frowning groups on that nine-point scale, which was much larger than the average effect sizes of about .1 or .2 in the successful Wagenmakers replications and right in line with what Strack had found originally – but not in the camera group, where the difference was minuscule and statistically non-significant. This, they write, provides evidence that, as per the paper’s title, “Both the Original Study and Its Failed Replications Are Correct.” In other words, it could be that facial feedback is real, but if you feel like you’re being observed, the effect is stymied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This could explain the whole sequence, from the original, exciting experiment to the dispiriting follow-ups from 2016: There were no cameras in the original paper (and the various replications of it that followed), so the effect was observed. Then Wagenmakers’ replicators introduced a new feature of the experiment – cameras – that disrupted the effect, so <i>poof</i>, the effect went away.</p>
<p>Toward the end of their paper Noah, Schul, and Mayo write of the importance of “cumulative science”, and their research is a good example of how that principle could be put to work to help resolve what has become something of a vexing controversy in social psychology. Now, researchers have a new theory to work with: being observed can disrupt the facial feedback effect. One study can’t <i>prove</i> this, of course – it’s time, as always, to run more of them, to get a few inches closer to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>This sort of research also introduces an important cautionary note into the question of how science should be communicated to the public – as an ongoing process rather than as a generator of open-and-closed facts. It is often the case that fairly limited, difficult-to-generalise-from lab findings get popularised in overhyped ways – the reason the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">power posing controversy</a>, for example, blew up the way it did has just as much to do with the way the findings were popularised and presented to the public (both by Amy Cuddy herself and by journalists and others) than with the core research itself. At the same time, when a famous finding fails to replicate, sceptics can be quick to label the entire topic as junk science. This new replication of a failed replication provides the latest reminder that psychological lab findings – particularly sexy, counterintuitive ones from social psych – can be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>quite context-dependent and can wither when even subtle changes to the experimental procedure are made. This should make us all the more sceptical about the big, bold claims made by popularisers in TED Talks and elsewhere – and all the more aware of the importance of careful, nuanced science reporting and communication.</p>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-10445 size-full" height="500" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/cyberbullying.jpg" width="501" />
<p>The English Oxford Dictionary defines cyberbullying as:</p>
<p><em>“The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature”</em></p>
<p>However, cyberbullying encompasses many other scenarios and, although it might not seem as threatening as physical bullying, the psychological consequences are equally bad. Cyberbullying has been shown to result in lower self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and, in some instances, can even lead to suicide.</p>
<p>Several studies have found there are connections between cyberbullying and other socio-demographic factors such as gender and age. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5682-4">study</a> recently published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> has compared patterns of cyberbullying victimization across seven European countries and looked specifically at internet use and socio-demographic as well as psychosocial variables.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their results showed that the highest degree of online bullying occurred in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%).</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers performed a school-based study in seven European countries (Germany, Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Spain), asking students to complete specially designed questionnaires. These contained simply phrased questions with definitions and examples of bullying behaviors online, with emphasis on the elements of hostility or hurtfulness. Their study included 12,372 14-17 years olds.</p>
<p>When comparing individual countries to each other, their results showed that the highest degree of online bullying occurred in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%).</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the high rate of cyberbullying in Romania might be linked with the sudden rise in internet use, which has resulted in a large technological gap between parents and the younger generation. In other words, parents struggle to keep up with their children and the newest online developments, and therefore are not able to provide the right kind of education and protection (boundaries) that children require.</p>

<p>One of the most worrying findings of this study is the overall increase in cyber-victimization since the <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/33731/1/Risks%20and%20safety%20on%20the%20internet(lsero).pdf">“EU Kids Online” study</a> carried out in 2011. Though these studies are not completely the same (the ages of the adolescents vary), this shows a potential growing trend in cyber-victimization that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>To understand cyber-victimization and why some individuals are affected more than others, the authors looked at this in relation to other factors, not only including previously studied socio-demographic characteristics, but also other aspects that might provide a bit more insight.</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for more than 2 hours a day increased the incidence of cyberbullying across three countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>They combined psychological factors and the surrounding social environment to analyze the teens’ physical and mental wellness and how this might be linked to cyber-victimization. Not surprisingly, adolescents that internalized their problems (such as depression and anxiousness) were more likely to experience cyberbullying in all countries analyzed.</p>
<p>The final part of the study focused on the overall time spent online and how this might affect the chances of cyber-victimization. The use of the internet for more than 2 hours increased the risk of online bullying in Romania. However, the use of social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for more than 2 hours a day increased the incidence of cyberbullying across three countries.</p>
<p>The study findings indicate that the psychosocial impact of cyberbullying needs to be acknowledged and dealt with, as it is related to distress and psychopathological symptoms. The researchers also call for educational settings to integrate information and communications technology education into their curricula, especially where use of the internet has risen abruptly. The observational nature of the study limits conclusions about the direct causes of cyberbullying. As five years have passed since the data used in the study was collected, its ability to represent the current picture of cyberbullying may be limited.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Juggling home and work commitments is <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/31721/worklife-separation-is-impossible-heres-how-to-deal-with-it">never easy</a>, and yet there’s been surprisingly little research into how either demands – or support – at home or work may spillover into the other context. Does a frustrating or combative workday negatively affect family life that evening, for instance? Or if your partner is emotionally supportive when you both get home, will you “pass it on”, and be more supportive of colleagues the next day? And, are men and women affected in the same ways? A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000340">new paper</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, provides some provocative answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34482"></span></p>
<p>In the first of two studies conducted in the Netherlands, Lieke ten Brummelhuis at Simon Fraser University and Jeffrey Greenhaus at Drexel University asked both members of 26 heterosexual working couples, most of whom had children, and who had been together for an average of 17 years, to fill in questionnaires each day for five days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Immediately after work, they answered questions about their emotional work demands and support that day – whether they’d been confronted with demanding clients or co-workers, for example, or whether a colleague had made time to listen to their problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Just before going to sleep, they then filled in another questionnaire, which asked about interactions at home after work. (They had to indicate how much they agreed or not with statements such as “Today, my family solved problems together”.) They also completed a brief survey that assessed both how much support they felt they’d received from their partner after work that day, and how much support they’d been able to offer their partner –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>cheering them up, or listening while they talked about work problems, for instance.</p>
<p>The results showed some intriguing gender differences. On days when the men had heavier work demands, they admitted offering less support to their partners – and their partners backed this up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>reporting they’d received less support, and that the quality of the family relationship was lower. But when the women had had a tough day at work, there was no impact on support or family life. What’s more, when the women reported receiving more emotional support from colleagues at work in the day, they also said that evening that they had offered their partners more support, and, supporting the honesty of these claims, their partners also reported that the quality of the family relationship was higher. This positive carry-over of support from work to the home did not occur with the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To investigate what impacts home demands and emotional support – or lack of it – might have at work, the researchers then recruited 64 co-worker pairs for another five-day study. At the start of each day, all participants filled in a questionnaire that asked about home demands and support. Then, in the afternoon, they filled in another survey that asked about what support they’d offered their paired co-worker that day, and also about the quality of the team relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found a similar pattern of results to the first study: men with heavier home demands provided less emotional support to their co-worker, and team relationship quality was rated as lower by both members of the pair. For women, heavier home demands did not negatively affect the emotional support they were able to offer their co-worker – and, when they got more support at home, they offered more support at work, and the quality of the team relationship improved. Again, this positive association was not found for the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers write, “Among women, we found only positive work-home processes in both directions, whereas among men, we found only negative work-home processes in both directions.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might be because, according to gender norms, women are expected to provide more emotional support and put more effort into maintaining relationships than men are, the researchers speculate. As they also note, equal roles for men and women are more valued in the Netherlands than in some other countries, such as the US. “It is possible that gender differences in a North American sample may be even more pronounced than in our studies,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are reasons to be cautious about some of the conclusions. Notably, the data on support provided and received and on relationship quality (at home and at work) was collected at the same time, so it’s impossible to be sure of the direction of the relationship. But as the researchers write, this short-term study does provide several leads for future research, which might explore the observed gender differences, and also whether there are strategies that might help to turn the negative processes observed in men into positive ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9644">A Brief Guide to Neuro-Products</a></h4>

On this blog I usually focus on academic, scientific neuroscience. However, there is a big world outside the laboratory and, in the real world, the concepts of neuroscience are being used (and abused) in ways that would make any honest neuroscientist blush.



In this post I'm going to focus on three recent examples of neuro-products: commercial products that are promoted as having some kind of neuroscience-based benefit.

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/13/friendship-bench-a-model-for-accessible-mental-health-care/">Friendship Bench—A Model for Accessible Mental Health Care</a></h4>

<p></p>
<p>In 2017, Mental Health America reported that one in five adults with mental illness say that they are not receiving the mental health care that they need. (Mental Health America, 2017) The reasons for this are the following:</p>
<li>
<ul>(1) they do not have <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/03/05/roundtable-what-can-science-do-to-promote-parity-between-mental-and-physical-health-in-the-insurance-industry/">insurance</a> for it</ul>
<ul>(2) they do not have enough money to pay for the service</ul>
<ul>(3) mental health care providers are lacking</ul>
</li>
<p>There is one mental health care provider for every 529 individuals in the US. This gap widens significantly for specialized mental health care. Only 20% of children with mental health problems receive some form of mental health services. The reason is that there are only about 8000 child and adolescent psychiatrists practicing in the US. In San Francisco alone, the Center for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) reports that there are about 32 child psychiatrists and 88 child psychologists per 10,000 children ages 0 to 17 years old.</p>
<p>There is a need for re-imagining the delivery of mental health care. One such method is known as the <em>Friendship Bench Intervention</em> (see video). The friendship bench has been undergoing development for more than 20 years in Harare, Zimbabwe where the Harare City Health Department in collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe Medical School sought to solve a major cause of disability from non-communicable diseases in the region, mostly common mental disorders such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/11/does-depression-accelerate-aging/">depression</a> and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/06/recent-drug-warnings-about-suicide/">suicidal ideation</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Friendship Bench </em>is a task-shifted brief intervention and problem-solving therapy for common mental disorders which is provided by female lay health workers trained in specific aspects of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, particularly in problem-solving therapy and behavior scheduling. </p>
<p>In short, the <em>Friendship Bench</em> mitigates common mental disorders such as depression by utilizing female lay health workers who are trained and supervised by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists to perform problem-solving therapy in a primary care setting.</p>
<p>The problem-solving approach starts with the patient identifying the cause of his mental illness. For example, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/12/21/hard-economic-times-and-increased-suicide/">unemployment</a>. Interestingly, this approach deviates from the conventional where experts aim at diagnosing the patient from the symptoms that they present. Problem-solving therapy aims to provide a positive orientation of the patient towards resolving these identified<em> problems</em>. This makes them realize that they can have control in overcoming their mental illness.</p>
<p>The lay workers follow a script and conduct 6 sessions lasting from 30 to 45 minutes for each patient. The first session involves three components: (1) <em>Opening the Mind </em>or <em>kuvhura pfungwa</em>, (2) <em>Uplifting </em>or <em>kusimudzira</em>, and (3) <em>Strengthening </em>or <em>kusimbisa</em>. The first session aims to let the patient open their mind and identify their problems. They would then be allowed to choose only one to work on. The lay worker and the patient will then identify how to solve this problem realistically and formulate an action plan. This is an iterative process where the subsequent sessions will develop based on the first session.</p>
<p>Common mental health disorders that the <em>Friendship Bench</em> aims to treat are the following: <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">depression</a>, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/05/25/how-misreading-bodily-signals-causes-anxiety/">anxiety</a>, panic disorder, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/24/how-does-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-change-the-brain/">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, cognitive disorders, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/06/the-future-of-healing-addiction-holistic-tech-assisted-rehabilitation/">substance abuse</a>.</p>
<p>Hiring and training lay workers from the community can significantly increase the mental health workforce. The requirement for the adult female trainees in this program is an educational background with at least 8 years of formal schooling (secondary schooling may suffice). The average age of the trainees is 58-years old. The training can be easily implemented, and it is cost-efficient at only $200 per health worker.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23992" height="338" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/Framework-for-the-Theory-of-Change.jpg" width="576" /></p>
<h6>Figure 1. An Example of a Theory of Change Framework Output. LHW = Lay Health Workers</h6>
<p>Community engagement is a key process in the development of the <em>Friendship Bench</em>. The goal is to bring community members, experts, researchers, and other key stakeholders together and become equal partners in the program. They engage in a workshop to develop a theory-driven framework known as the <em>Theory of Change</em>. Members hypothesize the best treatment initiative plan for the community’s patients and form a theory of “<em>how and why an initiative works?</em>”. Variables are identified and constantly measured for every cause and effect pathway. This illustrates proof that an initiative has a positive or negative impact. The theories are continuously measured, challenged, and changed until the desired impact is formulated (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>The success of the program is heavily reliant on the training method, the translation of the manual to the local language, and the integration of the program with the culture of the community. Lay workers must also learn how to translate and utilize tools used in common mental disorders such as the 20 item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), and Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 Depression Test (PHQ-9). These are the basic metrics used to determine if the therapies are working.</p>
<p>Adding to the workforce, competent lay mental health workers in the primary care setting can offset the gap in mental healthcare delivery in communities. Its success in first-world countries is more likely because its growth can be sustained by leveraging readily accessible financial resources allocated each year by public health organizations. Its robust infrastructure, particularly in primary care clinics and information technology such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/09/13/logging-on-for-psychotherapy/">telehealth services</a>, can boost the <em>Friendship Bench </em>programs. A limitation of the <em>Friendship</em> <em>Bench</em> is that it is designed to treat adult common mental disorders. To emulate this program so that it can suit the need for pediatric mental health disorders is of importance.</p>

<p>The structured nature of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy/CBT and its clearly defined principles (based on the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours) make it relatively easy to train practitioners, to ensure standardised delivery and to measure outcomes. Consequently, CBT has revolutionised mental health care, allowing psychologists to alchemize therapy from an art into a science. For many mental health conditions, there is now considerable evidence that CBT is as, or more, effective than drug treatments. Yet, just like any form of psychotherapy, CBT is not without the risk of unwanted adverse effects.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10608-018-9904-y">paper</a> in <em>Cognitive Therapy and Research</em> outlines the nature and prevalence of these unwanted effects, based on structured interviews with 100 CBT-trained psychotherapists. “This is what therapists should know about when informing their patients about the upcoming merits and risks of treatment,” write Marie-Luise Schermuly-Haupt and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-34469"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked each CBT-therapist (78 per cent were female, average age 32, with an average of 5 years experience) to recall their most recent client who had taken part in at least 10 sessions of CBT. The chosen clients (51 per cent were female, average age 38) mostly had diagnoses of depression, anxiety or personality disorder, in the mild to moderate range.</p>
<p>The interviewer – an experienced clinical psychologist trained in CBT – followed the Unwanted Events-Adverse Treatment Reactions checklist, asking each therapist whether their client had experienced any of 17 possible unwanted events during therapy, such as deterioration, new symptoms, distress, strains in family relations, or stigma.</p>
<p>The therapists, who work at outpatient clinics in Germany, reported an average of 3.7 unwanted events per client. Based on the therapists’ descriptions, the interviewer then rated the likelihood of each unwanted event being directly attributable to the therapeutic process – making them a true side-effect (only those rated as “definitely related to treatment” were categorised as such).</p>
<p>Following this process, the researchers estimated that 43 per cent of clients had experienced at least one unwanted side-effect from CBT, equating to an average of .57 per client (one client had four, the maximum allowed by the research methodology): most often distress, deterioration and strains in family relations. Over 40 per cent of side-effects were rated as severe or very severe, and over 25 per cent lasted weeks or months, though the majority were mild or moderate and transient. “Psychotherapy is not harmless,” the researchers said. There was no evidence that any of the side-effects were due to unethical practice.</p>
<p>Examples of severe side-effects included: “suicidality, breakups, negative feedback from family members, withdrawal from relatives, feelings of shame or guilt, or intensive crying and emotional disturbance during sessions.”</p>
<p>Such effects are not so surprising when you consider that CBT can involve exposure therapy (i.e. gradual exposure to situations that provoke anxiety); discussing and focusing on one’s problems; reflecting on the sources of one’s stress, such as difficult relationships; frustration at lack of progress; and feelings of growing dependency on a therapist’s support.</p>
<p>The longer that a client had been in therapy, the more likely they were to have experienced one or more side-effects. Also, and against expectations, clients with milder symptoms were more likely to experience side-effects, perhaps because more serious symptoms mask such effects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, before the structured interviews, the therapists were asked off the top of their heads whether they felt their client had had any unwanted effects – in this case 74 per cent said they had not. Often it was only when prompted to think through the different examples of potential side-effects that they became aware of their prevalence. This chimes with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/28/the-mistakes-that-lead-therapists-to-infer-psychotherapy-was-effective-when-it-wasnt/">earlier research</a> that’s documented the biases that can lead therapists to believe therapy has been successful when it hasn’t.</p>
<p>Schermuly-Haupt and her colleagues said a conundrum raised by their findings was whether unpleasant reactions that may be an unavoidable aspect of the therapeutic process should be considered side-effects. “We argue that they are side-effects although they may be unavoidable, justified, or even needed and intended,” they said. “If there were an equally effective treatment that did not promote anxiety in the patient, the present form of exposure treatment would become unethical as it is a burden to the patient.”</p>
<p>There are reasons to treat the new findings with caution: the results depended on the therapists’ recall (an in-the-moment or diary-based methodology could overcome this problem), and about half the clients were also on psychoactive medication, so it’s possible some adverse effects could be attributable to the drugs rather than the therapy (even though this was not the interviewer’s judgment, and remember the researchers used a conservative estimate of side-effects, only considering those that were “definitely” related to therapy by their estimation, and ignoring those that they considered “rather” or “most probably” related).</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that “An awareness and recognition of unwanted events and side effects in all therapies will benefit patients, improve therapy or reduce attrition, analogous to the benefit of measurement-based monitoring of treatment progress.”</p>

They're interested in cell types, circuit diagrams, and monitoring and manipulating neural activity in model organisms such as Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice.

You'll get different answers depending on who you ask. We know that “individual neuroscientists have chosen to work at specific spatial scales, ranging from .. ion channels ... to systems level” and we know there is a range of temporal scales, “from the millisecond of synaptic firing to the entire lifespan” (<a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/06/19/JNEUROSCI.3174-17.2018.abstract">Koroshetz et al., 2018)</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Within this diverse set of scales, the circuit is a key point of focus for two primary reasons: <b><span style="color: #cc0000;">(1) neural circuits perform the calculations necessary to produce behavior</span></b>; and (2) dysfunction at the level of the circuit is the basis of disability in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.</blockquote><br />So maybe key point #1 is a generic working definition of a neural circuit, and is the focus of many NIH BRAIN-funded neuroscientists. But there's a huge leap from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465370/" target="_blank" title="Integrated circuits and molecular components for stress and feeding: implications for eating disorders.">impressive work</a> on e.g. mapping, manipulating, and controlling stress-related feeding behaviors in rodents, and key point #2: isolating circuit dysfunction and ultimately treating eating disorders in humans.

<div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>In the last months, as part of the Google Summer of Code 2018, I have been working on a project that aimed to implement neuronal models which represent averaged population activity on NeuroML2/LEMS. The project was supported by the INCF organisation and my mentor, Padraig Gleeson, and I had 3 months to shape and bring to life all the ideas that we had in our heads. This blog post summarises the core motivation of the project, the technical challenges, what I have done, and future steps.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-2b42ffb6-7fff-9f82-bb90-62c669712720"><span style="font-size: 16pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Background</span></span></span><br /><span>NeuroML version 2 and LEMS were introduced in order to standardise the description of neuroscience computational models and facilitate the shareability of results among different research groups</span><span>1</span><span>. However, so far, NeuroML2/LEMS have focused on modelling spiking neurons and how information is exchanged between them in networks. With the introduction of neural mass models, NeuroML2/LEMS can be extended to study interactions between large-scale systems such as cortical regions and indeed whole brain dynamics. To achieve this, my project consisted of implementing the basic structures needed in NeuroML2/LEMS to simulate Neural Mass Models and compare the results with previously published papers. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>What I did</span><br /><span>During the project I focused on the implementation of three previously described Neural Mass Models into NeuroML2/LEMS:</span><br /><span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">1. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">del Molino et al., 2017</span><span style="color: #2c3f51; font-size: 6.6pt; vertical-align: super;">2</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">: This study analyses the dynamics and interaction between excitatory neurons and three types of interneurons (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing).  It first looks at the interactions between single units representing each population and then it scales up to analyse the interaction between a network with multiple interacting units in each population.

<p>"Subscriptions are a great way to draw a steady stream of revenue from readers — unless readers share their login credentials with everyone they know. As publishers try to grow subscription businesses, they have to figure out how to handle password-sharing, a phenomenon that subscription services like Netflix and Spotify have wrestled with for years. On one hand, subscribers are often the most enthusiastic members of a publisher’s audience, and limiting access cuts into their ability to proselytize. But allowing flagrant password-sharing disincentivizes would-be subscribers, and it’s hard to limit it without aggravating your users. Password-sharing is a well-documented problem for subscription content companies, particularly in digital video. Reuters/Ipsos research released last summer found that more than one-fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds had used a login from somebody outside their household to stream content; overall, 12 percent of adults said they’d done so...."</p>

<img alt="Pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Problematic-facebook-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Social networking sites (SNSs) are now an integral part of our everyday lives, with most of us using social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram daily (or indeed several times a day) to stay connected with family and friends.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the value that SNSs offer users, there is growing evidence to suggest that some users engage with SNSs in maladaptive ways, potentially resulting in new, or exacerbating existing, psychological problems. In our <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0245-0?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Psychology-Psychiatry/Psychology-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Facebook_use">study recently published in <em>BMC Psychology</em></a>, we set out to understand problematic social networking use more clearly, focusing specifically on the use of the popular SNS, Facebook, and its association with social attachment. Specifically, we explored four forms of problematic Facebook use.</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Impression management’ whereby an individual conveys an ideal (false) self, that suggests, for example, that they are in the perfect intimate relationship</li>
<li>‘Intrusive Facebook use’ whereby time spent on the platform intrudes on one’s daily life by limiting the quality of time alone or with others</li>
<li>‘Problematic self-disclosure’ by divulging personal problems, potentially impulsively, and in a moment of vulnerability</li>
<li>‘Social comparison’ whereby an individual uses Facebook to compare themselves to others</li>
</ol>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10428" style="width: 258px;"><img alt="Pexels" class="wp-image-10428 " height="173" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/People-on-cell-phones-300x209.jpg" width="248" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">rawpixel.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pexels</div></figure>
<p>A wealth of recent studies indicate that using Facebook in these ways is linked to <a href="http://www5.csudh.edu/psych/Is_Facebook_Creating__iDisorders__The_Link_Between_Clinical_Symptoms_of_Psychiatric_Disorders_and_Technology_Use,_Attitudes_and_Anxiety-2013-Computers_in_Human_Behavior_Rosen_Whaling_Rab_Carrier_Cheever.pdf">low mood and low self-esteem</a> in some users of the site. Therefore one important question is “What is driving certain people to use Facebook in these problematic ways?” One possibility is differences in social attachment.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Social attachment</strong></h3>
<p>Attachment behaviors that an adult engages in are influenced in large part by the quality of their attachment relationship with their primary caregiver(s). Adult attachment is typically considered to exist along two continuums – attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.</p>
<p>Attachment anxiety is thought to be related to a history of inconsistent caregiving experiences, in which the caregiver was at times sensitive to the infant’s needs, and at other times non-responsive. High levels of attachment anxiety in adulthood are associated with emotional lability, increased dependency, and preoccupation with the availability of others, as these individuals strive to keep people close.</p>
<img alt="Pexels" class="size-medium wp-image-10427 alignleft" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Facebook-phone-300x202.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Attachment avoidance on the other hand, has been linked to early interactions in which the primary caregiver was unresponsive to the needs of the infant and was emotionally unavailable when the infant showed signs of dependence. In adulthood, high levels of attachment avoidance manifests in resisting intimacy, inhibiting emotional expression, and a having a strong sense of independence, while also striving to remain connected to the people in their lives.</p>
<p>Given Facebook’s highly social platform, we wondered whether people with high levels of attachment insecurity would be motivated to use Facebook in unhelpful ways as a means of connecting with others. Given the tendency for human attachment systems to become activated during times of stress, we predicted that psychological distress and low self-esteem would mediate the relationship between adult attachment and problematic Facebook use.</p>
<h3><strong>Attachment’s impact on problematic Facebook use</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>We found that those people with high levels of attachment anxiety and low self-esteem, engaged in all four problematic Facebook behaviors when feeling distressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our study, 717 adult Facebook users completed a host of online questionnaires pertaining to psychological distress, self-esteem, attachment, and Facebook use. We found that those people with high levels of attachment anxiety and low self-esteem, engaged in all four problematic Facebook behaviors when feeling distressed.</p>
<p>Engaging in social comparison as a route to self-enhancement, portraying an idealized self that may be attractive to others, disclosing personal information, and using the site intrusively were considered to be motivated by a desire to elicit contact and connection from others online.</p>
<p>We also found that when distressed, those people with high levels of attachment avoidance and low self-esteem, engaged in impression management and intrusive Facebook use that impacted their social relationships offline. This too is understandable when considering that Facebook is likely to offer a less threatening forum within which to have one’s attachment needs met, for those who shirk intimacy in their offline relationships.</p>
<p>These findings are important for users of Facebook for several reasons. Most importantly, learning about the patterns of Facebook use that are linked to negative outcomes such as low mood and depression, may alert people to be more mindful of the ways in which they engage with social media platforms. It can also help mental health professionals assess risk factors for problematic on-line social networking.</p>
<p>We suggest that our four problematic Facebook behaviors can resemble maladaptive attachment behaviors, used to maintain close social connections. While those high in attachment insecurity may derive some comfort and relief from using Facebook in these ways, these positive benefits may be short-lived. Use of Facebook in these ways may potentially maintain or lead to further distress and low self-esteem since Facebook, and other SNSs are poor substitutes for real-world, bi-directional, and supportive social relationships.</p>

<p>Especially if you are in a long-term relationship your own sexual functioning is not a purely an individual matter but is bound up with your partner’s. Previous research has looked at this dynamic, finding for example that people are generally happier with their sex lives when they have the perception that they and their partner are sexually compatible. Surprisingly, however, before now the influence of your partner’s broader personality traits on your own sex life had not been studied.</p>
<p>A German study of nearly a thousand long-term couples (98 per cent of them heterosexual) is the first to look at this question. Among the stand-out findings is that, for women, having a more conscientious partner was associated with having better sexual functioning and a more satisfactory sex life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028211">Writing in The Journal of Sex Research</a>, the researchers, led by Julia Velten at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, suggested that “men who are thorough and dutiful may feel the need to satisfy their partner sexually, which may in turn lead to better sexual function of their partners.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34477"></span></p>
<p>The researchers interviewed each participant and his or her partner individually over the phone about their personality traits; their sexual responsiveness (that is, how easily aroused or easily turned off they are, which psychologists consider stable traits and refer to as “sexual excitation” and “sexual inhibition”); and finally, in detail, about their sexual function. For women this last measure incorporated sexual satisfaction, arousal, desire, lubrication, pain, and orgasm frequency; for men it was focused on erectile function but also included questions about desire, satisfaction and orgasm.</p>
<p>The participants had an average age of 51 and had been in their current relationships for an average of 24 years.</p>
<p>Consistent with past research, the female and male participants’ own traits were relevant to their sexual function. For both sexes, and to no great surprise, being more easily sexily aroused and less easily turned off (for example by stress at work or performance anxieties) were associated with healthier sexual function.</p>
<p>In terms of their own personality traits, only the participants’ own higher levels of conscientiousness (a trait that incorporates self-discipline, orderliness and ambition) were correlated with healthier sexual function – perhaps because people high in this trait put more effort into their sex lives.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, given past research suggesting that extraverts have more active and enjoyable sex lives (and the same for people higher in openness-to-experience), the participants’ own scores on these traits were not related to their sexual function, perhaps because they overlapped so much with the measures of sexual excitation and inhibition that were included in the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>More novel and interesting are the effects on participants of their partners’ traits. Men who were easily aroused benefited sexually if their partner was disposed the same way. “In men who are easily aroused by erotic fantasies or visual stimuli, having a partner who responds in a similar way may facilitate sexual function,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for women, having a partner prone to greater sexual inhibition was associated with their own sexual function being poorer. “Especially in couples who limit their sexual interactions to penile-vaginal intercourse, women whose partners are more sexually inhibited … may experience fewer sexual interactions that provide enough stimulation,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of partners’ personality traits – the key trait for women, as mentioned above, was their partner’s conscientiousness – women with more conscientious partners tended to report their own sexual function to be healthier. “Conscientious individuals might have the tendency ‘not to let it slip’ and to continue working on the sexual relationships with their partners,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Also relevant for women was their partner’s agreeability – those with <em>less</em> agreeable partners reported healthier sexual function. Meanwhile, men reported healthier sexual function when their partners scored higher in emotional <em>in</em>stability. We await explanations for these particular associations.</p>
<p>Outside of individual traits, men’s age was, unsurprisingly, negatively correlated with their sexual function scores. However, across the couples, relationship duration was not correlated with participants’ sexual function. “This finding implies that a healthy sexual life is possible even in long relationships,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Among the study’s limitations is that shy couples or couples with greater relationship problems are less likely to have agreed to take part. Also, the results only present a static picture of the dynamics between the measured variables – we don’t know how they are causally related to each other. Nonetheless, this study breaks new ground by uncovering the ways that our partner’s personality might have an influence on our own sexual function.</p>
<p>“Improving our knowledge about intra- and inter-personal factors contributing to sexual concerns is valuable to further develop psychological treatments for individuals and couples who are distressed by low sexual function,” the researchers said.</p>

<h4>You don’t need a neuroscience background, and it might even help if you don’t. You do, however, need research experience.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8TEOr5iqhtR6arYk3s-YDQ.jpeg" />Wrangle your studies before Catwoman steals your books. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>You’ve given it <a href="https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-get-a-phd-in-neuroscience-cdb4daf6a248">some thought</a>, and a neuroscience PhD could be in your future. So, what do you need to get there?</p><h4>Undergraduate degrees before the PhD</h4><p>In theory, you could come from almost any academic background before coming into neuroscience, as long as you also have research experience (see below). According to a recent Society for Neuroscience report, most students who matriculate into Ph.D. programs in the U.S. have degrees in neuroscience, biology, or psychology. However, a huge chunk of applicants also come from chemistry and mathematics, and many students come in with dual degrees (see <a href="https://www.sfn.org/careers-and-training/faculty-and-curriculum-tools/training-program-surveys">SfN 2016</a> for more details).</p><p>I was curious about the broader population of neuroscientists beyond those currently enrolled in PhD programs, so I conducted a Twitter survey:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>Ye who do neuroscience research* (or who have in the past), what was your undergraduate major? Leave a reply if it's not listed! *self-defined</p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/analog_ashley/status/1021736834324471808">@analog_ashley</a></p></blockquote><p>Many, many people had write-in responses. When we pull together all of the responses (<em>n</em>=950), here’s what the breakdown looks like:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/583/1*QCNe0vq6P7CcuV9i5LbTWg.png" /></figure><p>There were a host of other undergraduate degrees ranging from biotechnology to animal behavior to economics (okay, isn’t that just very advanced animal behavior?) with one or two folks claiming them. They’re not included in the graph for simplicity, but the full dataset is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q1PR8nGAn1C_tHuMG5T2rcvKDDzllHicoB-7s-Hic8Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Not surprisingly, the answers for computational neuroscientists were <a href="https://twitter.com/neurograce/status/1021739964743213059">slightly different</a>.</p><p>Among the list, there were a few fun answers. Neuroscientist and Journal of Neuroscience Editor-in-Chief Marina Piciotto was a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarinaP63/status/1022096460299558912">Biology &amp; English major</a>. Famed neuroscientist David Eagleman also had a surprising answer: <a href="https://twitter.com/davideagleman/status/1021969629634211840">British &amp; American Literature</a>. “No joke,” he added.</p><p>In summary, neuroscientists come from a wide range of backgrounds, and you shouldn’t feel like there’s only <em>one </em>path into a career of neuroscience. Neuroscience is a wonderfully diverse field that touches on almost every other discipline — after all, it is fundamentally the study of how brains (and their owners) interact with the world. Our field is better off with perspectives from every intellectual angle, as well as with people who have thought deeply about very specific subfields.</p><h4>How competitive is it?</h4><p>Regardless of your undergraduate major, you should be at the top of your game academically. Neuroscience programs in the U.S. receive anywhere between 5 and 875 program applicants — <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">170 on average</a>. For the academic year 2016–2017, the average acceptance rate for U.S. PhD programs was <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">19%</a>. Although there’s more applicants, most programs <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">report</a> that they’re accepting the same number of students, largely because of limited funding from training grants and space in faculty labs. So, it does seem to be getting more competitive, and it’s not clear that more positions for graduate students are going to be opening soon.</p><h4>What are admissions committees looking for?</h4><p>Most graduate programs will evaluate you on three main categories: your research experience, your GPA (grade point average from college), and your GRE scores (Graduate Record Examinations, a commonly required standardized test in the U.S.). The relative weight of those attributes will vary between school to school, and even depends on the members on the admissions committee. Some schools will set hard cutoffs for the numerical categories there, but they’re typically not disclosive about it. <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">Applicants in 2016 </a>had an average undergraduate GPA of 3.56, and average verbal as well as quantitative GRE scores of 158.</p><p>Your best bet is to do as best as you can in those three categories. Of course, if you’re out of college, it’s hard to go back and change your GPA. If you have a low GPA and GRE scores, the best way to improve your chances of getting into graduate school is by spending some time working in a lab.</p><h4>Research experience before graduate school</h4><p>While there isn’t usually a strict requirement for research experience, a striking <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">98% of applicants</a> to U.S. PhD programs have at least some previous experience working in lab. Still, you should get some research experience for more than just getting into PhD programs— you should have research experience so that you have insight into whether or not you like doing research.</p><p>Your research experience could be in one lab for a long time, or short bursts in other labs. If you’re at a college that doesn’t have a ton of research, there are many summer research programs out there. I found it really informative to find research experiences beyond the brick walls of my small liberal arts school. Many summer programs are also specifically for underrepresented minorities, and most of them will pay you a stipend as well as cover room and board.</p><p>My personal advice is this: Take the courses that keep you engaged and motivate you to learn. If your gut homunculus pulls you into cognitive science, follow that. If you find molecular models dreamy, by all means, <em>build them all. </em>Put in the time and effort to do well on your GREs. Apply to many summer research programs, either at your home institution or beyond. You’ll excel when it becomes less about grades and more about the mysteries that the brain refuses to simply roll out on a red carpet for us. And ultimately, that’s what being a neuroscientist is about, anyway.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist? An honest account of life as a researcher” (Columbia University Press). </em>The goal is to offer aspiring neuroscientists honest, informative insight about our field as well as education and careers in it. Most importantly, it will reflect the opinions and experience of our entire community — so, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback. What did I miss?

<h3>Falling Through the Cracks in Pain Management</h3>
<h4>Pain and Opioids</h4>
<p>Chronic pain is debilitating, and it can cause patients to “<em>fall through the cracks</em>”. Health care institutions struggle to find ways to create “<em>nets</em>” and catch these patients. Pain medications include <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/30/opioids-for-chronic-pain-an-interview-with-dr-webster-pain-guru/">opioids which are used to treat chronic pain.</a> Opioids often fail to treat the patient’s primary medical condition. As time goes by, patients tend to be unsatisfied with the results.</p>
<p>Also, there is a good chance that some of these types of pain medications will be abused. In fact, pain medicines such as opioids are part of the United States opioid crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), every day, more than 115 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids. (CDC/NCHS, 2017) The opioids include prescription drugs, including fentanyl, and synthetic street drugs such as heroin.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total economic burden of prescription opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion a year which includes the costs in health care, lost productivity, addiction therapy, and criminal justice involvement. (Florence, Zhou, Lou, &amp; Xu, 2013)</p>
<h4>Pain and Mindfulness Meditation</h4>
<blockquote><p>To overcome pain, another task which demands higher controlled attention must be pitted against it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other forms of therapies were introduced to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/16/chronic-pain-and-the-brain/">manage chronic pain</a>.</p>
<p>One such therapy is known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/">mindfulness meditation</a>. Mindfulness meditation is: “the intentional self-regulation of attention from moment to moment”. (Goleman &amp; Schwartz, 1876) This method has been used for quite some time. A study done in mindfulness meditation by Dr. Kabat-Zinn has reported that 65% of patients have exhibited a reduction of pain by more than 33% and about 50% of patients have reported a reduction of pain by 50% over a 10-week period of therapy. (Kabat-Zinn, 1982)</p>
<p>Some studies performed in mindfulness meditation have reported patients with strong feelings of anger towards their pain condition while others report some anxiety while undergoing mindfulness therapy. la Cour and Petersen point out that meditation therapy requires a learning curve for the patient to access the more important personal “<em>inner space</em>”. (la Cour &amp; Petersen, 2015) This can be an exciting learning experience of discovery for some patients while other patients may see this as a constant battle that in itself can be a painful experience.</p>
<p>The next question to consider therefore is to find out which patients benefits the most from mindfulness meditation and which are not, and then find out what other therapies we can use in these patients.</p>
<h3>Enter Virtual Reality: Pain and Attention</h3>
<p>Recall a recent injury. Ever wonder why after a trauma or injury has occurred, there seems to be a delay in which actual pain is produced? Pain has to first gain access to consciousness and demands central attentional resources by interrupting all other current brain processes such as worry, fear, or desire. It does so easily because of its noxious nature. (Eccleston, 1995) Pain, therefore, can be considered as a controlled task. To overcome pain, another task which demands higher controlled attention must be pitted against it.</p>
<p>The characteristics of pain such as intensity, quality, and/or pattern affect the probability of capturing attention. In chronic pain, for example, the characteristics of the pain and its intensity are important for pain processing. This may explain the reason why there are “<em>good</em>” days and “<em>bad</em>” days for patients with sciatica, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">multiple sclerosis</a>, and other causes of chronic pain. Persistent pains with unpredictable sensory qualities that fluctuate in intensities are more likely to be processed. (Eccleston, 1995)</p>
<p>Finding the perfect distractor with the ability to interrupt persistent pain stimulus processing is key to coping. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/19/virtual-reality-new-steps-in-stroke-rehabilitation/">Virtual reality</a> (VR) systems offer computer-generated sensory inputs that involve sight, sound, and touch. These inputs make it essentially difficult for the brain to ignore especially if the VR program is immersive. Immersive VR is an experience that gives a perfect illusion to the patient that is in the virtual world. The strength of the illusion of the presence of the virtual world reflects the amount of attention drawn into the virtual environment. (Hoffman, Doctor, Patterson, Carrougher, &amp; Furness III, 2000)</p>
<p>Virtual reality may not replace the conventional pain management anytime soon. Once the patient comes out of VR, they will soon feel pain once more. Pharmacologic therapy remains the mainstay of pain management. But the problem of using pharmacologic treatment for pain remains a challenge. Undermedication is a problem of pain management failure. But higher doses of opioids poses a serious risk such as respiratory failure and encephalopathy. Therefore, the application of pain relief using VR may be for the use of procedural pain management such as minor surgical procedures, wound cleaning and debridement, and escharotomy in burn victims.</p>

<p>Abundant research during the past few decades has shown that this “subjective age” can be a powerful predictor of your health, including the risk of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/geronb/gby006/4838941?redirectedFrom=PDF">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986588">diabetes and hypertension</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395617310233">dementia</a>, and hospitalisation for illness and injury, and <a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1803.pdf">even mortality</a> – better than your actual age. In each case, the younger you feel, the healthier you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The link probably goes in both directions. So while it’s true that ill-health may make you feel older, a higher subjective age could also limit your physical activity and increase feelings of vulnerability that make it hard to cope with stress – both of which could, independently, lead to illness. The result could even be a vicious cycle, where feelings of accelerated ageing lead you to become more inactive, and the resulting ill-health then further confirms your pessimistic views. And as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180712-the-age-you-feel-means-more-than-your-actual-birthdate">I recently wrote for BBC Future</a>, understanding this process could be essential for designing more effective health programmes.</p>
<p>Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier has led much of the work examining this phenomenon, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617303598">his latest paper</a>, published with colleagues in the journal <i>Intelligence</i>, extends this understanding by revealing a surprising link with IQ. According to this research, the more intelligent we are in our late teens and early 20s, the younger we will feel in our 70s – and this may also be reflected in various markers of biological ageing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34472"></span></p>
<p>Stephan’s team’s analysis is based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which for many years has tracked thousands of men and women born between 1937 and 1940. In 1957, each member of the study took an IQ test, which Stephan then compared to their estimated subjective age, taken more than 50 years later in 2011.</p>
<p>In line with other studies, the average participant felt about 17 per cent younger in their 70s than their actual age – but the precise difference depended on their adolescent intelligence (those participants who’d had higher teen IQ felt even younger), a link that remained even when the analysis controlled for the influence of demographic factors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After establishing this basic correlation, Stephan’s team also looked for other personal characteristics, such as education level and different personality traits, that might mediate the relationship. They found that greater “openness to experience”, which is associated with having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a higher IQ, seemed to be important. Perhaps a higher IQ, which helps us to process complex information more easily, also increases our curiosity about the world, and it’s that sense of wonder and excitement that can make us feel more youthful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Having higher intelligence might also make it easier to cope with the challenges that come with age, so that we don’t feel so vulnerable to our changing circumstances. And people with higher IQ may also be better able to deconstruct the negative age stereotypes that might otherwise place limits on our behaviour and lead to greater feelings of vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study chimes with others that have similarly linked a higher childhood IQ to various signs of biological ageing, including the length of our cells’ telomeres (the protective “caps” on the end of chromosomes that tend to shorten over the lifespan) and epigenetic markers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given that lower subjective age appears to encourage healthier behaviours, these new findings could help to explain these earlier IQ-ageing correlations. But once again, we should be wary of oversimplifying these relationships. A higher IQ could easily enhance our health through other pathways, such as the socioeconomic advantage that comes with better education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Stephan’s paper can’t unpick all these mechanisms, but it could certainly provoke some fascinating future research on the ways our cognitive abilities influence the ageing process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’d be particularly interested to see similar studies that look beyond the reasoning found on traditional intelligence tests. As <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/21/why-some-smart-people-make-foolish-decisions/">Research Digest explored last year</a>, our critical thinking skills (such as how well we are able to dispassionately evaluate an argument), are more predictive than our basic IQ of the likelihood we will experience many life events – from the small stresses such as losing your passport to getting divorced, falling into debt, or catching a sexually transmitted diseases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Might other measures of “good” thinking, prove to have an even closer link to the measures of subjective and biological ageing? It would be fascinating to see if these skills – which can be taught – could also help people cope with the challenges of old age, by reducing stressful mistakes and encouraging healthier behaviours, and by helping us to question age stereotypes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the meantime, Stephan’s paper provides one more fascinating example of the far-reaching effects of our thinking and reasoning abilities, far beyond their obvious influence over our academic and professional success.</p>

<p>When we say that our close friends have become a part of us, we’re usually talking metaphorically. Yet prior research has shown there is a literal sense in which this is true. For instance, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202250220">we’re slower at judging whether given personality traits apply to us or our friends</a>, compared with when judging whether traits belong to us or someone we’re not close to – it’s as if our friends’ traits and our own have somehow become shared, which makes the judgment trickier. Similarly, in terms of brain activity, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002339">we respond to mistakes made by friends in a similar way to how we respond to our own mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Sarah Ketay at the University Hartford have shown how this absorption of friends into our self-concept can manifest at a visual level, affecting our ability to distinguish their faces from our own. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518788702">Writing in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a>, Ketay’s team said “The present research supports the idea that close others are processed preferentially and may overlap with the self.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34451"></span></p>
<p>An initial study with 24 female undergrads involved them looking at a series of photos of their own face interspersed with photos of a close female friend’s face: each time a face appeared on-screen they had to press a button as fast as possible to indicate whether it was their face or their friend’s. In another condition, the challenge was similar but this time they had to distinguish between their own face and the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity, such as Reese Witherspoon. All the faces had neutral expressions.</p>
<p>The participants’ reaction times were slower in the friend condition than the celebrity condition suggesting they found it more difficult to distinguish their own face from their friend’s face, than from a celebrity’s face. Further analysis confirmed this wasn’t due to any differences in similarity of the friend’s/celebrity’s faces compared with their own, nor due to any lack of familiarity with the celebrity faces.</p>
<p>A second study with more female undergrads was similar, but this time the researchers used morphing to blend the participants’ faces either with the faces of a close female friend or with the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity. Again the challenge was to indicate as fast as possible whether the face on-screen was their own or someone else’s. This time the participants were slower to make the self-other judgment when their face was morphed with their friend’s than when it was morphed with a celebrity’s.</p>
<p>The sample sizes were small (though the study was not underpowered) and exclusively female, so a replication attempt of these findings would certainly be welcome. However, the results are novel: “No previous studies have considered the possibility that … self-other overlap may extend to facial processing,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>In our culture we like to speculate about the effects of different parenting styles on children. A lot of this debate is wasted breath. Twin studies – that compare similarities in outcomes between genetically identical and non-identical twins raised by their biological or adopted parents – have already shown us that parental influence is far more modest than we usually assume. Now a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618784890">paper</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> goes further, using the twin approach to reveal how it is mistaken to see the parent-child dynamic as a one-way relationship. “Given the current evidence … it is more accurate to conceptualise parenting as a transactional process in which both parents and children exert simultaneous and continuous influence on each other,” write Mona Ayoub at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-34446"></span></p>
<p>Ayoub’s team used data from the Texas Twin Project, including parents’ ratings of their parenting style (specifically, their warmth and stress levels in relation to each child), and the children’s ratings of their own personality traits based on a kids’ version of the Big Five personality test. In all there were 497 identical twin pairs in the study, 480 same-sex non-identical twin pairs, and 434 opposite-sex twins, and their average age was 13.</p>
<p>The logic underlying the researchers’ approach was that if children affect their parents’ parenting style via their own gene-linked traits, then, on average, the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of identical twins should be more similar than the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of non-identical twins.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the researchers found. Twenty-seven per cent of the variance in parents’ levels of warmth, and forty-five per cent of the variance in their parental stress levels, was attributable to genetic influences originating in their children. A significant portion of this genetic influence was related to the children’s personality traits: kids who scored higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness tended to have parents who parented with greater warmth, and kids with lower agreeableness had parents who parented with more stress.</p>
<p>The data back up what many mothers and fathers already know through experience – being a paragon of patient parenting is not much effort when your little darling is an angel, it is much trickier when they are a brat.</p>
<p>The children’s personality traits explained about half of the association between children’s genes and their parents’ behaviour, suggesting other gene-linked traits in the children also have an influence, such as, the researchers suggested, depression and “externalising behaviours”, which means things like aggression and disobedience.</p>
<p>The study was also able to look for the influence of non-shared environmental factors on the parents’ behaviour and the children’s personality traits – these are environmental (non-gene linked) factors that affect one twin but not the other, contributing to different parenting styles toward each twin in the same family. The data can’t specify what these factors are, but an illness that affects one twin but not the other would be an example.</p>
<p>Though less significant than children’s genetic effects, the researchers found that non-shared environmental factors both increased parents’ stress levels and reduced children’s conscientiousness and emotional stability (it’s not clear if such environmental factors affect parental stress, which then has an adverse effect on their children’s personality, or vice versa, or both).</p>
<p>Ayoub and her colleagues highlighted the practical implications of their findings: “parenting interventions may be more efficacious if both parents and children are treated, such that the intervention is tailored to the unique qualities of both parties.”</p>
<p>A limitation of the study is that it only provides a snapshot of the dynamics between parents and children. It’s likely that the effect of children’s personalities on their parents’ nurturing style is just one aspect of an unfolding dynamic, as parenting style then feeds back and affects the child (albeit more modestly than we often assume). “Longitudinal designs that assess child personality and parenting throughout development will be useful,” the researchers said, “especially because parenting can take different meanings across different developmental stages.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9637">How Accessible is Psychology Data?</a></h4>

In a slightly depressing new paper, two researchers describe how they tried to get access to the data behind 111 of the most cited psychology and psychiatry papers published in the past decade. The researchers, Tom E. Hardwicke and John P. A. Ioannidis of Stanford, wanted to place the data into a 'Data Ark' to ensure its continued preservation for science. Unfortunately, in most cases, the data was not made available.



The paper is called Populating the Data Ark and it's out now in PLoS ON
