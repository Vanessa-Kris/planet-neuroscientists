                <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/06/12/research-and-intuition/">Research and Intuition</a></h4>

<p>So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is “research”.</p>

<p>Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I’m working on in the broadest sense, “How does the brain work?”, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing, but I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to “invent” new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.”<br /><br />“Because I always know what I’m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn’t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I’m only aware of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok">interviews in German</a> without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?</p>



<p>To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There’s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to accept them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.</p>



<p>It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.</p>



<p>Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.</p>



<p>These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than “pure” research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of “aims”. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.</p>



<p>However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods – but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. </p>



<p>I think that also researchers in “hard” sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a simple virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-sperm-dna-space-radiation-exposure-six-years">Mouse sperm thrived despite six years of exposure to space radiation</a></h4>

<p>Sperm appears to be unfazed by long stints in outer space.</p>



<p>In the longest biological experiment on the International Space Station yet, freeze-dried mouse sperm remained viable after nearly six years in space. Exposure to space radiation <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg5554">didn’t seem to harm the sperm’s DNA</a> or the cells’ ability to produce healthy “space pups,” researchers report online June 11 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That may be good news for future spacefarers. Scientists have worried that chronic exposure to space radiation might not only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-lunar-lander-moon-radiation-health-risks-astronauts">put astronauts at risk for cancer and other diseases</a>, but also create mutations in their DNA that could be passed down to future generations (<em>SN: 9/25/20</em>). The new results hint that deep-space travelers could safely bear children.</p>



<p>Studying how space radiation affects reproduction is tricky. Instruments on Earth can’t perfectly mimic space radiation, and the ISS lacks freezers for long-term cell storage. So biologist Teruhiko Wakayama of the University of Yamanashi in Kōfu, Japan and colleagues freeze-dried sperm, allowing it to be stored at room temperature. The team then sent sperm from 12 mice to the space station, while keeping other sperm from the same mice on the ground.</p>



<p>After returning the sperm cells to Earth, rehydrating them and injecting them into fresh mouse eggs, the team transferred those embryos to female mice. About 240 healthy space pups were born from sperm kept on the ISS for nearly three years; about 170 others were born from sperm kept on the space station for nearly six years. Genetic analyses revealed no differences between these space pups and mice born from sperm stored on the ground. Space pups that mated as adults had healthy children and grandchildren.</p>



<p>Though these results are promising, they may not capture the full the effects of space radiation, since the ISS is partially shielded from radiation by Earth’s magnetic field. Also, space radiation damages DNA, at least in part, by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">shattering water molecules in cells</a> (<em>SN: 7/15/20</em>). Since freeze-dried sperm didn’t contain water, it may have been especially resistant to radiation.</p>

<p><strong>Tamer breeds of cattle tend to have smaller brains,</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/tamer-cow-smaller-brain">reports Michael Price</a> at <em>Science</em>. The researchers think that because humans have selectively bred beef and dairy cows to be calm and gentle, over time the brain areas involved in aggression have shrunk. The work is consistent with other studies finding that domesticated dogs, pigs and other animals have smaller brains that their wild counterparts.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-variant-immunity">Here’s what you should know about COVID-19 vaccine booster shots</a></h4>

<p>Roughly six months ago, on December 11, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States. What followed was a push to get that shot, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first">to those at high risk</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). Moderna’s jab <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval">wasn’t far behind</a>, securing emergency use authorization just a week <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-authorize-pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic">after Pfizer’s</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/20; SN: 12/11/20</em>). And then in February 2021, there were three COVID-19 vaccines when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">FDA authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson’s shot</a> (<em>SN: 2/27/21</em>). </p>



<p>Now, around 40 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. Just over half of residents have gotten at least one dose. Meanwhile, U.S. cases of COVID-19 and deaths have plunged to their lowest levels since March 2020.  </p>



<p>Amid the ongoing effort to vaccinate people, two big questions loom: Will immune protection against the coronavirus be long-lived? Or will people soon need booster shots?</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>Right now, “no one knows” if boosters will be necessary, says Kirsten Lyke, a vaccinologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. But researchers are working on figuring that out.</p>



<p>Here’s what we know so far about coronavirus immunity and potential booster shots. </p>



<h4>Immunity lasts at least six months and possibly much longer.</h4>



<p>Whether people need COVID-19 booster shots or not largely hinges on how long the body’s immune response protects against getting severely ill. So far, this protection lasts at least six months and possibly much longer, researchers say.</p>



<p>Much of what scientists know right now about long-term immunity comes from what they have gleaned from people infected with the coronavirus. And it appears that immune memory to the virus largely follows the rules, at least for most people, says Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p>



<p>That means that after the virus gains a foothold, the body unleashes a wave of immune proteins called antibodies and immune cells dubbed T cells to fight off the virus. Antibodies typically attack the virus itself while T cells raise additional alarm bells or kill infected cells. Together, antibodies and T cells defeat the virus and then help the immune system form a memory of the pathogen, Ellebedy says. That immune memory is crucial for protection if a person gets exposed to the virus again.</p>



<p>Studies are uncovering evidence that most people develop immune memory to the coronavirus. Ellebedy has found signs of antibody memory, for instance, in people who recovered from an infection. People who had mild COVID-19 had long-lived <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4">antibody-producing immune cells in the bone marrow</a> 11 months after infection, he and colleagues reported May 24 in <em>Nature</em>. These cells continue to make antibodies against the virus long after it has left the body, providing protection if a person is exposed again.</p>



<p>Evidence is building that the vaccines offer similar, if not better, protection. In that case, boosters might not be needed for some time. In the last update from vaccine developers, “things looked pretty good,” Lyke says. People who received Moderna’s shot still<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916"> </a><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916">have high levels of antibodies six months after getting the second dose</a>, researchers reported in April. And Pfizer’s jab<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious#:~:text=Footer%20Aside%20Section1-,Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20Confirm%20High%20Efficacy%20and%20No%20Serious%20Safety,Landmark%20COVID%2D19%20Vaccine%20Study"> </a><a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious#:~:text=Footer%20Aside%20Section1-,Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20Confirm%20High%20Efficacy%20and%20No%20Serious%20Safety,Landmark%20COVID%2D19%20Vaccine%20Study">has an efficacy of 91.3 percent against COVID-19 symptoms after six months</a>, the pharmaceutical company announced April 1 in a news release.  </p>



<p>Still, “we don’t know how any of these COVID-19 vaccines perform past the one-year mark,” Lyke says. The earliest trials that tested whether the vaccines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response">prompt an immune response</a> are just now reaching that point, and researchers are following up with participants (<em>SN: 7/21/20</em>).</p>



<h4>Coronavirus variants could make booster shots more likely.</h4>



<p>Even if the protection provided by the immune system is long-lasting, viruses like the coronavirus are adept at evading those responses. Case in point: the emergence of viral variants that can make COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccine-questions-immunity-variants">less effective than they are against the original version</a> of the virus (<em>SN: 5/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>“I don’t think we would be talking about potentially boosting” if it weren’t for the variants, Ellebedy says. “What we are seeing so far is that the vaccine is really robust, so why would we even need a booster if the virus doesn’t change?”</p>



<p>Available vaccines still protect people from the worst of COVID-19, even if they’re infected by one of the circulating variants. But that might not always be the case. “There may be a future variant that we’re unaware of that may come down and surprise us,” Lyke says. Still, multiple COVID-19 vaccines are flexible in design and can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">easily be adapted</a> to tackle new variants (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Then, it becomes a matter of manufacturing the doses.   </p>

</h4>

<p>Some companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, are already testing booster shots to fight emerging variants, in particular, the beta variant that first emerged in South Africa. Early results from Moderna hint that people who received a booster shot that uses the version of a viral protein from the beta variant had antibodies that were better at stopping the variant from infecting cells compared with people who got a third dose of the original vaccine.  </p>



<p>Still, one question is what the best variant booster might look like, says Jerome Kim, a vaccinologist and director-general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, South Korea. Researchers around the globe meticulously monitor circulating influenza strains, for example, to figure out which strain or strains should be included in flu vaccines. In the future, experts may need to keep an eye on the coronavirus in a similar way.</p>



<h4>Low vaccination rates worldwide may also make booster shots more likely.</h4>



<p>As countries like the United States begin to emerge from the worst of the pandemic, there are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">many others lagging behind in vaccinations</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). That’s in part because wealthy countries have bought the bulk of available doses to vaccinate their populations, leaving lower-income countries struggling to get shots.   </p>



<p>To date, more than 2 billion doses have made it into arms around the world. Some countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Chile and Israel, have given at least one dose to around 60 percent of their populations. But around only 1 percent of people in places like Nigeria and Sierra Leone have gotten at least one vaccine dose.</p>



<p>Low vaccination rates in many places pose a problem for efforts to quell transmission and bring the pandemic to an end. And the more the coronavirus spreads, the more opportunities there will be for new variants to emerge, increasing the likelihood of booster shots. The coronavirus “has managed to find the gaps, like any virus,” Kim says. “It’s in the nature of viruses to find the weak points. And before you know it, there’s another mutant.”</p>



<p>Some countries are flying blind due to a lack of genetic surveillance. Bolstering that ability in regions like Africa, Latin America and South Asia would help get a handle on coronavirus diversity in those places and capture emerging variants before they become a global problem.   </p>



<p>It’s also important to get vaccines to the places that need them through efforts like COVAX, an international initiative to help distribute COVID-19 to low-income countries. “We have to start going to the places that have really bad outbreaks because we know mutants will be generated,” Kim says.</p>





<h4>“Mix-and-match” COVID boosters might offer even more protection.</h4>



<p>To prepare for a future where people need COVID-19 boosters, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a clinical trial on June 1 to test <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-evaluating-mixed-covid-19-vaccine-schedules-begins">mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>The big question is whether mix-and-match vaccines strengthen the immune response against the coronavirus, says Lyke, one of the researchers leading the trial. If someone is given an mRNA vaccine, like Moderna or Pfizer’s, and then is given a Johnson &amp; Johnson booster, “can we increase [the immune response] by switching up the platform?” Lyke says.</p>



<p>Mixing different types of Ebola vaccines or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies">HIV vaccines</a>, for example, can trigger stronger immune responses than getting multiple doses of the same vaccine (<em>SN: 6/4/21</em>). The idea is that each shot will activate multiple parts of the immune system, Lyke says. An mRNA vaccine might prompt the body to make lots of antibodies that attack the virus. Then a dose of a vaccine like Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — which uses a common cold virus that has been modified so it can’t cause disease — might trigger more T cells. “If you combine [the shots], we hope to prove that you get the best of both responses that work synergistically,” Lyke says.</p>



<p>Early results from a similar trial being conducted in the United Kingdom hint that the answer for COVID-19 shots is yes. People given AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot followed by a dose of Pfizer’s eight weeks later developed <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.21257971v1.full.pdf">potent immune responses</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted June 1 at medRxiv.org. Antibodies from people who received the two different vaccines were better at recognizing variants like beta compared with those in people who got two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine.</p>



<p>A separate study in Spain also found that people given a dose of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot followed by a dose of Pfizer’s had <a href="https://www.isciii.es/Noticias/Noticias/Paginas/Noticias/Presentaci%c3%b3n-resultados-preliminares-CombivacS.aspx">high levels of antibodies</a> compared with people who got only one dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, researchers reported in May. But it’s unclear how those levels compare with people who got two doses of the same shot.   </p>



<p>One benefit of the U.S. trial is that it has a flexible design, Lyke says. That means that if new variants arise, researchers can add new groups to the trial to test newly developed boosters. “As we get data [about variants] that comes in from other countries, we can really start to hone in on holes in our data and what we need to answer.”    </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-giant-arc-3-billion-light-years-long-cosmology-space">An arc of galaxies 3 billion light-years long may challenge cosmology</a></h4>

<p>A giant arc of galaxies appears to stretch across more than 3 billion light-years in the distant universe. If the arc turns out to be real, it would challenge a bedrock assumption of cosmology: that on large scales, matter in the universe is evenly distributed no matter where you look.</p>



<p>“It would overturn cosmology as we know it,” said cosmologist Alexia Lopez at a June 7 news conference at the virtual American Astronomical Society meeting. “Our standard model, not to put it too heavily, kind of falls through.”</p>



<p>Lopez, of the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, England, and colleagues discovered the purported structure, which they call simply <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9363/presentation/874">the Giant Arc</a>, by studying the light of about 40,000 quasars captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Quasars are the luminous cores of giant galaxies so distant that they appear as points of light. While en route to Earth, some of that light gets absorbed by atoms in and around foreground galaxies, leaving <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">specific signatures in the light</a> that eventually reaches astronomers’ telescopes (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>The Giant Arc’s signature is in magnesium atoms that have lost one electron, in the halos of galaxies about 9.2 billion light-years away. The quasar light absorbed by those atoms traces out a nearly symmetrical curve of dozens of galaxies spanning about one-fifteenth the radius of the observable universe, Lopez reported. The structure itself is invisible on the sky to human eyes, but if you could see it, the arc would span about 20 times the width of the full moon.</p>

Lopez</span></figure>



<p>“This is a very fundamental test of the hypothesis that the universe is homogeneous on large scales,” says astrophysicist Subir Sarkar of the University of Oxford, who studies large-scale structures in the universe but was not involved in the new work. If the Giant Arc is real, “this is a very big deal.”</p>



<p>But Sarkar isn’t convinced it is real yet. “Our eye has a tendency to pick up patterns,” Sarkar says, noting that some people have claimed to see cosmologist Stephen Hawking’s initials written in fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the universe.</p>





<p>Lopez ran three statistical tests to figure out the odds that galaxies would line up in a giant arc by chance. All three suggest that the structure is real, with one test surpassing physicists’ gold standard that the odds of it being a statistical fluke are less than 0.00003 percent.</p>



<p>That sounds pretty good, but it may not be enough, Sarkar says. “Right now, I would say the evidence is tantalizing but not yet compelling,” he says. More observations, from Lopez’s group and others, could confirm or refute the Giant Arc.</p>





<p>If it is real, the Giant Arc would join a growing group of large-scale structures in the universe that, taken together, would break the standard model of cosmology. This model assumes that when you look at large enough volumes of space — above about 1 billion light-years — matter is distributed evenly. The Giant Arc appears about three times as long as that theoretical threshold. It joins other structures with similarly superlative names, like the Sloan Great Wall, the Giant Gamma-Ray Burst Ring and the Huge Large Quasar Group.</p>



<p>“We can have one large-scale structure that could just be a statistical fluke,” Lopez said. “That’s not the problem. All of them combined is what makes the problem even bigger.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flood-india-landslide-disaster-himalaya">Scientists have found the origins of a mysterious, deadly flood in India</a></h4>

<p>On February 7, a massive flood rushed through a valley in India’s Himalayan Uttarakhand state, washing out two hydroelectric power plants and leaving at least 200 people dead or missing. What triggered the deadly flood has been a mystery — but after amassing evidence from satellite images, seismic records and eyewitness accounts, a team of over 50 scientists now say they have solved the case.</p>



<p>The ultimate culprit was <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abh4455">a massive avalanche of rock and glacier ice</a> that tumbled 1,800 meters down a steep slope of Ronti Peak, setting off a cascade of events that led to the disaster, the researchers report online June 10 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>This was no ordinary landslide, says Daniel Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary in Canada. “This was a multi-hazard scenario where it was much more fluid and mobile than a landslide would be expected to be. It was a worst-case scenario of rock and ice and [the] height of the fall.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>This animation shows the progress of the avalanche, as it rushes downslope toward the two hydroelectric dams at Tapovan. Colors show which material was dominant in the avalanche as it flowed. At the start, where the avalanche is colored red, it was mostly (about 80 percent) rock and 20 percent ice. Green is mostly ice, as the rocks begin to splash or settle out. By the time the flow reached Tapovan, it had become mostly water (blue).</figure>



<p>Initially, the culprit was suspected to be a well-known high mountain hazard called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-glacier-flood-disaster-himalayas-uttarakhand">glacial lake outburst flood</a>, in which dammed-up water suddenly spills over its bounds and rushes down the mountainside (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>). But what little data were available in the immediate aftermath pointed to a possible landslide instead, Shugar says.</p>





<p>In the months that followed, he and his colleagues used numerous sources of data as well as computer simulations to painstakingly reconstruct what happened that day.</p>



<p>Here’s what the data show:</p>



<p>Starting around 10:21 a.m. local time on February 7, about 27 million cubic meters of rock and ice fell from the steep north face of Ronti Peak, which stands 6,063 meters above sea level. The landslide, consisting of about 80 percent rock and 20 percent ice, originated at a height of about 5,500 meters and tumbled downslope about 1,800 meters, traveling at a speed of up to 60 meters per second.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="photo of the side of a mountain" class="wp-image-3100449" height="542" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061021_CG_india-landslide_inline-680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100449">On February 9, two days after the disastrous flood, France’s Pléiades satellites snapped this high-resolution image of Ronti Peak, showing a scar on the steep north face of the mountain spanning 500 meters. That scar, a new feature, marks the origin of the avalanche of rock and ice that caused the flood. Using stereo images from these satellites, researchers also constructed high-resolution 3-D models of the site, which allowed them to estimate the volume of the avalanche.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100449">© CNES, Airbus DS</span></figure>



<p>Digital elevation models now reveal a rock scar on the slope that wasn’t there previously. Earlier images of the site suggest that a very long and wide fracture in the overhanging glacier had opened up by 2018.</p>



<p>As the landslide then rushed down the Ronti Gad stream valley, wet material splashed up the valley’s sides, depositing sediment and large boulders on the valley walls. Satellite images also captured thick blankets of airborne dust — the first indicators that a landslide might be the culprit.</p>



<p>As the landslide continued downhill, the ice began to melt due to the friction, helping to speed it along. Then, the landslide encountered a sharp bend in the valley, and much of the solid material dropped out, shifting it from a thick, viscous flow to a faster-moving, more fluid flow. These rushing waters were now on their way to the two hydroelectric power plants in their path downstream. Eyewitness accounts saw only this part of the flood.  </p>

</div>On February 7, the day of the disaster, a constellation of miniature cube satellites belonging to private imaging company Planet Labs snapped these images of vast dust deposits scattered across the valley below Ronti Peak but above the hydroelectric dams. These images were among the first clues that a landslide, rather than a glacial lake outburst flood, was responsible for the disaster.</figure>



<p>There are no easy answers for whether or how people can prepare for such a disaster — but the first step is a better understanding of possible causes, Shugar says. That’s where he hopes that this study can help. “We need to be doing a better job of hazard assessments, and not examining hazards in singularity.”</p>



<p>As for what role climate change may have played, it’s also difficult to say. There are no weather stations close to the site of the original slope failure that could provide temperature or precipitation measurements to assess changing climate in that region. But “we can say that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of natural disasters,” by thinning glaciers and their underpinnings, Shugar says.</p>



<p>And it’s also clear that increasing development in the mountains compounds the likelihood of disaster, adding to the urgency of understanding the possible dangers, he notes. “If the mountains themselves are becoming more hazardous, and we’re also pushing farther into those mountains, that becomes a dangerous mix.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-nucleus-dna-chromosomes-genome-organization">Cells cram DNA into the nucleus in two distinct ways</a></h4>

<p>There are only so many ways to cram DNA into a cell’s nucleus, a study suggests.</p>



<p>A cell’s complete genetic blueprint, or genome, is densely packed into chromosomes, condensing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-takes-shape-and-shifts-over-time">meters of DNA into a minuscule cellular vessel</a> only micrometers wide (<em>SN: 8/24/15</em>). But how chromosomes fold to fit inside the nuclei of diverse species is unclear.</p>



<p>There appear to be <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6545/984">two methods to stuff all of that DNA in</a>, researchers report in the May 28 <em>Science.</em> Cells can even flip-flop which arrangement they have by inactivating a molecule called condensin II, the team found.</p>



<p>If chromosomes were pieces of paper, some, like those of humans, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-view-reveals-how-dna-fits-cell">look like a crumpled ball</a> inside the nucleus, says Claire Hoencamp, a molecular biologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam (<em>SN: 10/8/09</em>). Others, like those of fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>), resemble flat sheets of stacked paper.</p>





<p>In the new study, Hoencamp and colleagues created heat maps that analyzed how chromosomes in the nuclei of 24 animal, plant and fungal species interacted inside their respective cells. The maps show the average number of connections among chromosomes in a cell’s nucleus — revealing how the genetic molecules fold — “on the scale from white to red,” says Olga Dudchenko, a genomicist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “The more red, the more interactions. The less red, the less interactions.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Chromosome contacts</h3>



<p>A wide range of animal (colored yellow on the evolutionary tree at center), plant (green) and fungal (blue) species package chromosomes inside the cell nucleus one of two ways, based on how the chromosomes interact inside a nucleus. Heat maps here show the average number of interactions among chromosomes (darker shades of red indicate more interactions). Maps that have large, dark red triangles (such as for the red piranha, top right) indicate chromosomes that crumple up like a wad of paper. Other more checkerboard patterns (such as for the ground peanut, top left) give rise to chromosomes that fold more neatly, like stacked sheets of paper.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="heat map patterns of chromosome interactions for 24 plants and animals" class="wp-image-3100352" height="1037" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060421_eg_dna-packaging_inline1_1030.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3100352">Adam Fotos, Olga Dudchenko, Benjamin Rowland and Erez Lieberman Aiden/Baylor College of Medicine</span></figure>
</div>



<p>Throughout evolutionary history, organisms across the tree of life have switched among different packing methods, the researchers found. “We worked with a zoo of species, and [at first] it looked like a zoo of patterns of genome folding,” Dudchenko says. “Some maps would look like a checkerboard pattern. Other ones would look like a mattress with weird x’s.” Over time, it became clear that many of the same chromosome folding features were popping up again and again in different species.</p>



<p>Three types of interactions result in stacked sheets of chromosomes, giving the heat maps that checkerboard or mattress look. In one interaction, seen in the ground peanut (<em>Arachis hypogaea</em>) for example, the ends of different chromosomes tend to touch. In another, chromosomes from organisms like fruit flies touch in the middle. And in an interaction seen in bread wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>), the arms of different chromosomes fold on top of one another.</p>



<p>Crumpled ball-like chromosomes, like those of the red piranha (<em>Pygocentrus nattereri</em>), sport a fourth type of interaction. In those structures, a chromosome folds in on itself in a tangle rather than touching other chromosomes, resulting in large red squares on the heat maps.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>DNA dealings </h3>



<p>Chromosomes interact in four different ways, resulting in two types of folding patterns. These selected heat maps for four species show the average number of interactions between two chromosomes; darker shades of red indicate more interactions. Three types of interactions — telomere clustering (ends of the two chromosomes touch), centromere clustering (middles touch) and telomere-to-centromere clustering (arms fold over each other) — make chromosomes fold like flat sheets of stacked paper. Interactions dubbed chromosome territories make chromosomes appear as crumpled balls: In this case, each chromosome is more likely to fold in on itself in a tangle, giving the appearance in the heat map of large, red squares.</p>

<p>Breaking parts of condensin II — a complex of proteins that helps assemble chromosomes as cells divide — can switch which organization a nucleus has. Tweaks to condensin II can make a crumpled human nucleus look like a folded fly’s nucleus, the team found. But some organisms have stacked sheets despite having intact condensin II. That means there may be other factors researchers haven’t yet found that push cells to cram chromosomes into the nucleus in a specific way, Hoencamp says.</p>

<p><strong>Actively advancing the SDGs – an exciting, challenging and rewarding journey  </strong></p>
<p>Tod<em><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12430" height="170" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/SDG2-300x170.jpg" width="300" /></em>ay’s societal challenges are complex. Tackling the complexity requires that researchers with diverse backgrounds actively work together. Transdisciplinary research provides exciting opportunities to unravel the complexity and explore solutions. Over the past two decades, I have been privileged to work at the interface of these challenges – at the global, African and country-level. I have also trained a cadre of professionals in adopting transdisciplinary mindsets.</p>
<p>My research and policy work focuses primarily on <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/">SDG 2</a> that seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this SDG touches all other SDGs and underpins the human rights fundamental to achieving all other SDGs.</p>
<p>A significant challenge in working on SDG2 is the diverse understandings of its components. I have found that the essential starting point is to make sure everyone around the table understands what we are discussing – in meetings with communities, policymakers or researchers. Assuming everyone is on the same page is a monumental mistake. Even in the international domain, SDG2 is often incorrectly labelled ‘ending hunger’ – only one element of SDG2. Hunger is an extreme (acute) form of food insecurity but also includes other outcomes such as malnutrition and the complexities of the coexistence of undernourishment and obesity in poor communities.</p>
<p>Some of these misconceptions relate to views that food security relates only to production rather than considering the inter-linked core elements of food security: <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf">availability, access, nutrition, resilience, agency and sustainability</a>. Yet, this 1970’s production perspective has changed with our <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974">deeper understanding of food insecurity and its causes</a>. Malnutrition is often understood as undernutrition rather than embracing all forms of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies (often termed ‘hidden hunger’) and overweight (including obesity).</p>
<p>Moreover, food security is <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0457-6.pdf">not a static condition</a>. Households can become more or less food insecure over time or seasons. Simultaneously achieving the four inter-linked elements of the SDG2 is the focus of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit">September 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit</a>. All four elements of SDG2 are outcomes of sustainable food systems but require specific actions to ensure that the elements of food systems work together to deliver on SDG2. The food systems approach provide ‘<a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/action-tracks">lenses’</a> to examine the effectiveness of food system components and stakeholders. Food systems approaches can help identify opportunities to address failures and tradeoffs in the system.</p>
<p>The field of study related to SDG2 is changing rapidly, making research in this field exciting, challenging and rewarding.  Working in this field has led to opportunities to work with diverse international transdisciplinary teams. From these treasured engagements, I have learnt an enormous amount about many topics that touch on, underly and shape research on SDG2. These opportunities have included drafting <a href="https://www.interacademies.org/publication/opportunities-future-research-and-innovation-food-and-nutrition-security-and">consensus reports</a> with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvN2O14zxAhXGiVwKHb5TDu4QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamopanel.org%2Fresources%2FNutrition%2Freports-and-briefings%2Fnourished-how-africa-can-build-future-free-hunger2%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mmaru-77mGAncdaz1WLfB">regional</a> and <a href="http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/hlpe-reports/en/">international foci</a> to direct scientific input into international processes such as the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.48565/scfss2021-wg92">United Nations Food Systems Summit preparation</a> to embarking on <a href="https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf">challenging research analysis</a> with relatively large teams of international experts. My work enabled participation in the drafting of the United Nations High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, which first <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3901e.pdf">defined food systems in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Through these opportunities, one learns how to share your own knowledge in a way that others outside of your field of expertise can understand while building your own knowledge from the engagement with others. Such engagement requires flexibility in thinking and the willingness to expand your scope of knowledge. It requires a great deal of listening and learning – something that does not come naturally to Professors.</p>
<p>While there are only nine years left before the end of the SDG era (2016 – 2030), we still have so much to learn about how to face, embrace and overcome the complexity of the issues related to SDG2. I believe that the opportunities afforded by the digital connectivity during the COVID pandemic have helped significantly advance our understanding of SGD2 in the context of food systems. The continual engagement by a range of stakeholders with the UN Food Systems Summit preparation has enabled the identification of ‘<a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/news/food-systems-game-changers-reflections">game changing’</a> solutions to advance progress on the SDGs. These solutions offer guidance on the future directions for researchers committed to supporting progress on the SGDs and SDG2 in particular. There are also opportunities for researchers to track the implementation and effectiveness of the solutions chosen by food systems stakeholders – albeit countries or the private sector. Stepping up to these opportunities will inform progress towards 2030 and provide the evidence base to inform the subsequent development era (post the SDGs).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-particle-collider-accelerator-physics">Physicists dream big with an idea for a particle collider on the moon</a></h4>

<p>If you could peer into a particle physicist’s daydream, you might spy a vision of a giant lunar particle accelerator. Now, researchers have calculated what such an enormous, hypothetical machine could achieve.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02048">particle collider encircling the moon</a> could reach an energy of 14 quadrillion electron volts, physicists report June 6 at arXiv.org. That’s about 1,000 times the energy of the world’s biggest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, at CERN near Geneva.</p>



<p>It’s not an idea anyone expects will become reality anytime soon, says particle physicist James Beacham of Duke University. Instead, he and physicist Frank Zimmermann of CERN considered the possibility “primarily for fun.” But physicists of future generations could potentially build a collider on the moon, Beacham says.</p>



<p>Such a fantastical machine would probably be buried under the moon’s surface to avoid wild temperature swings, the researchers say, and could be powered by a ring of solar panels around the moon.</p>



<p>To understand how the laws of physics work at energies higher than that of the LHC, scientists will need <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-lhc-proposed-particle-colliders-higgs-boson">bigger accelerators</a> (<em>SN: 1/22/19</em>). For example, the proposed Earth-based Future Circular Collider would be 100 kilometers in circumference, dwarfing the LHC’s 27-kilometer ring. A collider encircling the moon would be about 11,000 km around.</p>



<p>While building a collider that big on Earth might be possible, it could potentially displace people who live in its path — not an issue on the moon. But, like other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-wanted-build-solar-panels-moon">proposed projects</a> that could alter the moon’s appearance (<em>SN: 6/7/19</em>), the idea raises thorny questions about who gets to decide the fate of the Earth’s companion, Beacham acknowledges. Those questions will presumably be left for future generations to sort out.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>For many, moving out of the family home is a rite of passage, a sign that adulthood is just about to begin. Equally, however, there are plenty of reasons why somebody might move back <em>in </em>with their parents: after a break-up, to save money, for health reasons, or to care for ageing or unwell relatives. Anecdotally, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been another reason for such a move, with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/11/adult-children-move-back-parents-pandemic-costing-425-month/">articles</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/18/ill-cherish-these-moments-how-covid-has-swelled-the-boomerang-generation">proliferating</a> on children once more living with their parents and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/adult-children-parents-home-pandemic/2021/01/18/3e55ef70-5696-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html">offering advice</a> on how to deal with it.</p>



<p>But how do such “boomerang kids” frame their decision to move back home, and how do they ensure it goes well? A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584">new study</a> published in <em>Emerging Adulthood</em> finds four strategies young people use to make the transition back into the family home as positive as possible.</p>



<span id="more-42532"></span>



<p>Participants were 31 young adults, aged between 18 and 35, who had moved back into the family home. Researchers interviewed the participants on their experiences, before conducting an analysis of the data to pull out the key themes.</p>



<p>The analysis found an overarching concern for boomerang kids: framing their move as an “investment in the future” rather than something to be ashamed of. Multiple participants acknowledged the stigma of moving back home, with one expressing that it “made me feel insecure in my success… that others may judge me for it”.</p>



<p>This stigma, however, was frequently turned on its head and reframed as a positive decision for the future: participants mentioned the financial security it had given them, the increased likelihood of returning to university or graduate school due to this security, and the opportunity to get advice and support from parents.</p>



<p>The team also pulled out four communication strategies that participants used to navigate the move back home in a way that both reduced the experience of stigma and allowed them to have adult relationships with their parents. The first was to develop clear expectations with their parents in order to assert boundaries and set out what living together would look like in reality. Those discussions revolved around topics like curfews, meal times, chores, and other responsibilities.</p>



<p>Similarly, all participants saw contributions to the household as an important factor in destigmatising the move back home and making sure relationships worked well. These contributions included cooking, running errands, paying rent and doing other practical tasks, as well as making emotional contributions by listening to parents and sharing feelings.</p>



<p>Participants also indicated that it was important to make sure that parents knew the move was only temporary, and in some cases they shared a specific timeline. One participant noted the importance of “having a next step”: “I told them it would be a two year commitment and we’re pretty much on track for that.” This also helped with cultural stigma and shame: seeing the move as a time-bound transition period helped participants accept their move and frame it as a logical step.</p>



<p>Finally, participants stressed that engaging in “mature, responsible, adult behaviour” was key: waking up early, setting and keeping to routines and responsibilities, and functioning independently. For some, this stopped them from reverting back to their “child identity” when living at home, and established an adult relationship with parents that differed in dynamic from child or teen years.</p>



<p>Although family relationships will clearly differ from unit to unit, particularly when factoring in different geographies and cultural expectations, overall the interviews provide good insight not only into the reality of moving home, but into how to actually navigate it as well. Future research could look more closely at the <em>differences</em> in people’s experiences, and how this relates to personality type, background, and other individual factors.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper "Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/06/09/my-stack-for-research-ml-projects/">My stack for research ML projects</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap">For the past few months, I’ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. </p>



<p>At that scale, it’s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that’s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/trends">25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code</a>, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don’t want to support it.</p>



<p>Here’s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.</p>

<h2>Decision points</h2>



<h3>Local vs. cloud</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a> class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn’t mean you’re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.</p>



<p>I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn’t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using <strong>paperspace gradient</strong> for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called <em>experiments</em> which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn’t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/">AWS Batch</a>, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.</p>



<h3>Code organization</h3>



<p>One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a <strong>docker</strong> container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. </p>



<p>This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea – you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won’t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn’t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></strong>, using <strong><a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a></strong> as an autoformatter.</p>



<p>If you’re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you’re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity – and then some – is to switch to <strong><a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html">test-driven development</a></strong>. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don’t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn’t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.</p>



<p>I enabled <strong><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> (CI)</strong> in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn’t end up using it. It does look like it’s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via <a href="https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g">nvidia-docker</a>.</p>



<p>I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html">PyRSE</a>. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">I ended up using the <strong>datascience cookiecutter</strong></a> for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).</p>



<h3>TF vs. PyTorch</h3>



<p>I’ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use <strong>PyTorch</strong> this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider <a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">PyTorch Lightning</a>.</p>



<h3>Storing results</h3>



<p>One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don’t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. </p>



<p>Ideally, you’d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:</p>



<ul><li>each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)</li><li>you can safely delete stale results</li><li>you can query results to find the subet which you’re interested in</li><li>you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)</li></ul>



<p>You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using <strong><a href="http://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a></strong> (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7695" data-attachment-id="7695" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" data-orig-size="3026,1560" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-4-3/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" /></a>Wandb dashboard</figure>



<p>You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a></strong>, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.</p>



<p>Locally, I do still use <strong>tensorboard</strong> to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it’s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it’s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) – pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.</p>



<h3>Analyzing results</h3>



<p>I use <strong>jupyterlab</strong> locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don’t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn’t play well with git – the diffs are meaningless. I will try out <strong><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a></strong>, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. </p>



<h2>Mistakes I made</h2>



<p>I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. </p>



<p>That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading – some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format – I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. </p>



<p><strong>What I should have done</strong> is have one true intermediate format – e.g. <strong><a href="https://www.nwb.org/">NWB</a></strong> – I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a <strong>FAIR</strong> format in the intermediate stage – it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats – I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits – two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.</p>



<p>I experimented a bit with using <strong>make</strong> to create the intermediate format, and I think it’s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don’t exist but won’t try to recreate them if they’re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. </p>



<h2>Releasing code and models</h2>



<p>I didn’t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It’s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of <strong><a href="https://github.com/replicate/cog">cog</a></strong>, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on <strong><a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a></strong> (free bandwidth!)</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">New clues suggest people reached the Americas around 30,000 years ago</a></h4>

<p>Humans may have inhabited what’s now southern Mexico surprisingly early, between 33,448 and 28,279 years ago, researchers say.</p>



<p>If so, those people arrived more than 10,000 years before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/texas-toolmakers-add-debate-over-who-first-americans-were">folks often tagged as the first Americans</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/11/18</em>). Other preliminary evidence puts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-mexico-stone-artifacts-humans-americas-early">humans in central Mexico as early as around 33,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN</em>: 7/22/20).</p>



<p>The latest evidence comes from animal bones that biological anthropologist and archaeologist Andrew Somerville and two Mexican colleagues found stored in a Mexico City lab. The bones had been excavated in the 1960s at a rock-shelter called Coxcatlan Cave.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon analyses of six rabbit bones from the site’s deepest sediment <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/new-ams-radiocarbon-ages-from-the-preceramic-levels-of-coxcatlan-cave-puebla-mexico-a-pleistocene-occupation-of-the-tehuacan-valley/F4C32FB10E73D660CB7D9B44E2C29A72">yielded unexpectedly old ages</a>, the researchers report online May 19 in <em>Latin American Antiquity</em>. That sediment also contained chipped and sharp-edged stones regarded as tools by the site’s lead excavator.</p>





<p>Higher sediment layers yielded clearer examples of stone tools and other remnants of human activity dating to nearly 9,900 years ago.  Somerville, of Iowa State University in Ames, initially suspected that rabbit bones from the deepest sediment were perhaps around 12,000 years old. But analyses revealed they were much older, hinting humans were living in the cave roughly 30,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Somerville will next determine whether other animal bones from the ancient sediment display butchery marks, breaks where marrow was removed or burned patches from cooking. He also wants to locate and study possible stone tools from that same sediment that may be stored in the same lab.</p>



<p>Based on additional radiocarbon dates and comparisons with stone-tool finds from other Mexican sites, Somerville suspects that a separate occupation of Coxcatlan Cave occurred between 13,500 and 9,900 years ago. Regional food and water sources may have dwindled when the last Ice Age peaked between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago, causing the earliest settlers to leave and delaying further occupations  until conditions improved, Somerville speculates.</p>

<p>In the beginning, no one really understood how babies were made. Thinkers puzzled for millennia about how life arose from one generation to the next. But not until the 17th century did scientists start to seriously study the question. At that time, the theory of preformation held that minuscule humans already existed, fully formed, in either the mother’s menstrual blood or the father’s semen, depending on whether you were an “ovist” or a “spermist.”</p>



<p>Little changed until two late-19th century scientists, Oskar Hertwig from Germany and Hermann Fol from France, independently conducted experiments on sea urchins, proving conclusively that creating new offspring takes one egg and one sperm.</p>



<p>Despite the early confusion, the ancients were sure about one thing: Reproduction is far from a sure bet. Today, an estimated 15 percent of couples worldwide are unable to conceive a child naturally, leading to feelings of sorrow, loss and a profound sense of inadequacy for many. A century ago, science didn’t have much to offer these couples.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="black and white illustration of humans growing inside a sperm" class="wp-image-3100312" height="800" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_spermist.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100312">People used to think preformed humans grew inside sperm, as in this 1695 drawing.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100312">Nicolas Hartsoecker/Wikimedia Commons</span></figure></div>



<p>The only fertility intervention widely available in 1921 was artificial insemination by donor sperm, which was morally and legally fraught. In the first half of the 20th century, the practice was often considered a form of adultery; as recently as 1963, an Illinois court ruled that a baby conceived this way, even with the husband’s consent, was illegitimate.</p>



<p>In 1978, everything changed. The birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first “test tube baby,” proved that infertile couples had another option: in vitro fertilization. The technique involved removing a mature egg from the mother, mixing it in a lab dish with the father’s sperm, and letting the fertilized egg, called a zygote, grow for a couple of days. The zygote was then returned to the mother’s uterus, where it could implant and grow in an otherwise normal pregnancy.</p>





<p> Since Brown’s historic birth, scientists have devised a range of ways to give Mother Nature a boost in baby-making. The various methods are known collectively as assisted reproductive technology, or ART. Some 9 million babies worldwide have been born using versions of ART.</p>



<p>The impact has been as profound sociologically as it has been medically. Now that ART has become almost routine, many of the early complaints about scientists playing God and manipulating life have faded away. Parenthood is now possible for people who never imagined it in their futures, including same-sex couples and single parents, thanks to such refinements as egg donors, surrogacy and the successful freezing of eggs, sperm and embryos. And all of it begins, as human life itself does, with the egg.</p>

<h4>Good eggs</h4>



<p>Even scientists can’t make babies without eggs. Normally, a woman produces only one mature egg every month, and the quality of her eggs tends to decline as she reaches her late 30s. So researchers’ ability to retrieve and prepare this scarce resource for fertilization, and if necessary preserve the eggs through freezing, have all been crucial in assisting reproduction.</p>



<p>Women have two ovaries, each one containing thousands of immature egg follicles. During the childbearing years, the ovaries usually release mature eggs in rotation: a single mature egg bursting from the right-hand ovary one menstrual cycle, from the left-hand ovary the next.</p>



<p>But women using ART often rely on injections of various fertility hormones to get the process going. These shots will enable sluggish ovaries to produce eggs that can be fertilized either through intercourse or in the lab via IVF. For IVF, the most robust-looking candidates are chosen to implant or to freeze for later use. This first step in ART, it turns out, is also one of the trickiest: choosing the right hormones to get the eggs you need.</p>

<p>Knowledge about hormones and how they affect ovulation dates back to 1923, when scientists Edgar Allen and Edward Doisy of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis first isolated estrogen in experimental mice and rats and found that it was produced in the ovaries. By the 1940s, scientists had elucidated the ebbs and flows of other hormones in lab animals and humans — follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin — over the course of a typical menstrual cycle.</p>



<p>ART usually begins with a woman giving herself daily injections containing a cocktail of these hormones, generally for 10 to 14 days. But for some women who want to have children but are dealing with a cancer diagnosis, hormone injections aren’t an option — and the clock is ticking. They need to start cancer treatments as soon as possible, but many of the treatments are likely to damage the reproductive system.</p>



<p>To preserve their fertility, these women might choose to freeze their eggs before cancer treatment. But they might not have 10 or so days to wait until the hormone injections provoke their ovaries to produce extra eggs — nor might they be able to take the drugs in the first place if they have a hormone-sensitive cancer, such as some breast cancers, that ovulation-stimulating drugs might make worse. So for these women, researchers had to find ways to bring a bunch of eggs to maturity all at once and outside the body — a technique known as in vitro maturation.</p>



<p>In vitro maturation was first used in 1934, when Harvard researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/baby-rabbits-born-normally-after-fertilizing-glass">Gregory Pincus and E.V. Enzmann used it in rabbits</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/34, p. 149</em>). The two scientists cultured immature rabbit eggs for about a day, supplementing the nutrient broth either with extracts from cow pituitary glands or with an unspecified “maturity hormone.” Both supplements helped the immature eggs grow to maturity, at which point they were successfully fertilized.</p>



<p>In 1940, Pincus was asked by a <em>New York Times</em> reporter what the next big development might be in reproductive science. “There are no big steps, there are all little steps,” he said, declining to make any predictions. All he knew for sure, he said, was that the “big questions” of the day were: Why does an egg start to develop, and why does it continue to develop?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Gregory Pincus holding a rabbit in the lab" class="wp-image-3100313" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_pincus.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100313">In the 1930s, Harvard researchers Gregory Pincus (shown) and E.V. Enzmann grew rabbit eggs to maturity and fertilized them in the lab.

<p>When reproductive endocrinologists retrieve eggs from their ART patients, after either stimulating the ovaries via hormone injections or maturing the eggs in the lab, they have two choices: fertilize the eggs and implant the embryo right away, or store them. For women who are not yet ready to have a baby, storing the eggs is the best option. This is done through freezing — which, in the early days of ART, was a tricky business indeed. Eggs have a high fluid content that leads them to form crystals when frozen; during thawing, those crystals can damage the egg, especially the delicate apparatus needed to cut the cell’s chromosome number in half. By dividing the chromosomes, one egg plus one sperm can fuse together without doubling the chromosome count.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, egg freezing worked occasionally; the first successful pregnancy using a woman’s own frozen eggs, leading to the birth of healthy twins, was reported in 1986 by Christopher Chen of Flinders University of South Australia in Adelaide. But egg freezing was still a long shot. Estimates were that no more than 1 or 2 percent of thawed eggs would result in a live birth.</p>



<p>Then, in 1999, reports appeared of a more reliable freezing method: vitrification, which freezes the egg so rapidly that no ice crystals can form. A research team based in Australia and Italy described animal experiments in which 1 in 4 vitrified cow eggs were fertilized and later grew, by around day 5, to the blastocyst stage. It was only about half the rate achieved for fresh cow eggs, but it was still several times better than the rate for slow-frozen eggs. When it came to clinical use, some researchers put the live birth rate of vitrified eggs at about 2 to 12 percent for women under age 38.</p>



<p>At first, vitrification was limited to people who froze their eggs for medical reasons such as cancer. But in 2013, egg cryopreservation became an option for anyone who wanted to delay childbearing for any reason, medical or not.</p>



<p>By 2020, estimates were that a growing subset of women who choose egg vitrification each year in the United States do so because they’re not ready to have children yet but hope to eventually — lifestyle-related reasons that have come to be known as “social freezing.”</p>



<p>While social freezing is often promoted as a way to delay childbearing almost indefinitely, it turns out that most women never return to the clinic to use their frozen eggs. At McGill University in Montreal, for instance, William Buckett and his colleagues found that over the course of 13 years, the school’s cancer fertility preservation program treated 353 women, of whom 9 percent died, 6 percent got pregnant spontaneously, and the majority were either still dealing with their cancer or had lost touch with the clinic for unknown reasons. Just 23 women, 6.5 percent of the group, came back to McGill to use their frozen eggs or embryos. That low return rate is also true for women who opt for social freezing.</p>

<h4>Sperm meets egg</h4>



<p>Compared with the human egg, sperm are pretty simple. They were first observed in 1677 when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the Dutch inventor of one of the world’s first microscopes, took a look at his own ejaculate under magnification and noticed what he called “animalcules” swimming around in the sample. But their structure and function didn’t come into focus until 1876, when Hertwig watched a sperm fertilize the egg of a sea urchin.</p>



<p>Pincus and Enzmann, who were the first to bring mammalian eggs to maturity in the lab, used rabbit sperm to achieve the first laboratory fertilization in a mammal in 1934.</p>



<p>It took years of struggle to make the leap from rabbits to humans. In 1951, an oddity of sperm made it seem that Pincus and Enzmann had gotten lucky. Sperm cells, it appeared, needed to be primed in some way through a process called capacitation before they could pierce the egg.</p>



<p>Robert Edwards of Cambridge University, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-nobel-goes-developer-ivf">one of the world’s leading investigators in IVF</a> through the 1960s and 1970s, thought capacitation would be “a terrible obstacle to IVF,” recalls Roger Gosden, an embryologist who worked in Edwards’ lab and authored Edwards’ biography, <em>Let There Be Life</em>. He remembers some frantic attempts to mimic sperm capacitation — such as when scientists created porous chambers, roughly the size of an implanted IUD, or intrauterine device, used for contraception. The researchers would fill a chamber with sperm and insert it into the uterus of a volunteer, hoping to expose the sperm to whatever unknown capacitating substance exists in nature. After waiting a bit, the scientists would pull on a string attached to the chamber to retrieve the now “primed” sperm to see if they had indeed become better able to fertilize eggs in the lab.</p>



<p>In the end, scientists found an easier way. “You just have to wash the sperm to get rid of some surface constituents,” Gosden says, and the sperm are ready to fertilize an egg in a lab dish. Other difficulties in clinical research proved more formidable, such as gauging the best timing of egg retrieval from women, and tweaking how manbeatry days post-fertilization were best to transfer the zygote to the uterus. Edwards and his collaborators, including gynecologist Patrick Steptoe, had more than 300 failed attempts at in vitro fertilization before their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/40-years-ivf-baby-louise-brown">first success with Louise Brown in 1978 in England</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/18</em>). Edwards went on to win the Nobel Prize in 2010 for his IVF discoveries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Louise Brown as a baby" class="wp-image-3100318" height="484" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_louise.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100318">The 1978 birth of Louise Brown, a healthy baby girl, launched the field of in vitro fertilization. Although controversial at the time, IVF has been responsible for millions of births.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100318">ZUMA Press Inc./Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure>



<p>Among the beneficiaries of Edwards’ pathbreaking work is Claudy, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 29, and who in a different century might never have been able to have a baby of her own. Claudy sought out Michaël Grynberg and his colleagues at the Antoine Béclère University Hospital fertility clinic, just outside Paris, to discuss ways to preserve her fertility. It was 2014, and egg freezing through vitrification was becoming more common. But bringing an immature egg to maturity in the lab was still relatively rare. From the time of the first baby born from fresh lab-matured eggs in 1991 to the time of Claudy’s arrival at Grynberg’s clinic, only about 5,000 such births had occurred.</p>



<p>But Grynberg had no choice. He had to retrieve immature eggs from Claudy, for the sake of both speed and to avoid aggravating her hormone-sensitive breast cancer with fertility drugs. In addition, he would have to do something unprecedented in the context of cancer: Freeze those lab-matured eggs for later use. No baby had ever been born from eggs taken from a cancer patient that were matured in the lab and then frozen. (There had been one baby born at McGill in 2009 from a woman who did not have cancer, whose eggs were matured in the lab and frozen, then thawed.)</p>



<p>Grynberg extracted seven immature eggs and was able to grow six of them to maturity over the next 48 hours. Those six went into the deep freeze, while Claudy had surgery and chemotherapy.</p>



<p>A few years later, Claudy’s oncologist told her it was safe to get pregnant, and she spent a year trying to conceive. But she didn’t. So in 2018, she returned to Grynberg’s clinic, where the doctors prepared to thaw her six frozen eggs.</p>



<p>To fertilize them, in Claudy’s case, required an additional bit of ART. Because her eggs had been frozen, her partner’s sperm would need help to fertilize her eggs. Vitrification causes changes in the egg’s outer membrane that makes the thawed egg particularly hard for sperm cells to penetrate. This membrane, called the zona pellucida, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fine-scale-structure-egg-crucial-fertility">a formidable barrier</a> even in nature (<em>SN: 1/3/09, p. 15</em>). One of the first to describe it was Sardul Singh Guraya, a biologist at Punjab Agricultural University in India, who did his early work in field rats.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="illustration of a blastocyst heading toward the uterus" class="wp-image-3100311" height="600" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_blastocyte.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100311">After fertilization, the blastocyst makes its way to the uterus. When an egg is fertilized in the lab, scientists can snip a cell from this developing mass to check for genetic problems without causing injury.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100311">Nicolle Rager Fuller</span></figure>



<p>The zona pellucida, Guraya reported in 1978, is a barrier around the egg made of proteins and carbohydrates, and when one sperm breaches it, cortical granules rearrange themselves to shut out all other sperm. This ensures that the zygote will have a normal genetic complement of just two pairs of 23 chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father, rather than a grossly inflated number that would result if multiple sperm fertilized the egg.</p>



<p>Scientists spent much of the next decade trying to get sperm into eggs that had been frozen using micro-manipulations described with such invasive terms as “zona drilling.” But the sperm still failed to reach the nucleus for fertilization.</p>



<p>Then in 1992, Gianpiero Palermo, an Italian scientist on sabbatical from the University of Bari, reported on an accidental discovery he made while working in a fertility lab at the Free University of Brussels. When he tried to gently inject sperm beneath the outer layer of the egg, careful not to pierce the jellylike center known as the cytoplasm, he noticed that an occasional “dimple” in the membrane would allow the sperm to penetrate directly into the center anyway. When that happened, the egg was almost always fertilized. So despite the general recommendation to avoid doing so, Palermo tried injecting the sperm, tail and all, directly into the cytoplasm.</p>



<p>Of the first 47 attempts Palermo and his colleagues in Brussels made with this approach, 38 eggs remained intact after the injection, 31 were fertilized and 15 grew to embryos that could be transferred to a uterus.</p>

<p>Ultimately, four babies were born: two healthy boys from two singleton pregnancies, and a healthy pair of boy-and-girl twins. The Belgian scientists called the procedure ICSI (pronounced ICK-see), shorthand for intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</p>



<p>Today, injecting a single sperm directly into an egg is even more common than the traditional form of IVF that adds sperm to an egg in a lab dish to let fertilization happen on its own. The injection method is used in about two-thirds of ART cycles around the world. And it is used in virtually all cycles that, like Claudy’s, start out with a hard-shelled frozen egg.</p>



<h4>Growing a healthy baby</h4>



<p>In 2018, Claudy returns to the fertility clinic at the Antoine Béclère University Hospital in suburban Paris. She is 34 years old and cancer-free. Because of the unusual nature of her case — her eggs were immature when they were retrieved and were brought to maturity in the laboratory — her doctors are not confident the eggs will survive the thawing and subsequent manipulations.</p>



<p>All six of Claudy’s eggs defrost with no apparent damage. The scientists perform ICSI on the eggs, using fresh sperm from Claudy’s partner. Five of the eggs fertilize.</p>



<p>These five zygotes go into an incubator so they can develop to a stage that is ready to implant. They undergo the early stages of cleavage, in which one cell becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so on.      </p>



<p>At many fertility clinics elsewhere in the world, doctors might interrupt things at this point to snip off a cell or two from the early embryo to see if things are progressing normally. It was revolutionary to discover that this could even be done — a feat first accomplished in 1968 by embryologist Richard Gardner. At the time, Gardner was a graduate student working in Edwards’ lab in Cambridge. His work showed for the first time that it was possible in rabbits to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/toward-preselected-sex">take cells from a blastocyst without causing harm</a> (<em>SN: 8/3/68, p. 119</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="illustration of an egg implanted in the uterine wall" class="wp-image-3100315" height="600" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_celldiff.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100315">Once implanted in the uterine wall, the embryo’s cells begin to differentiate, eventually forming all the tissues and organs that make up a human being.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100315">Nicolle Rager Fuller</span></figure>



<p>Scientists can examine the chromosomes of those cells removed from a human embryo, a process called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD. They might be looking for a particular disease-linked gene that runs in the family, to avoid implanting an affected embryo in the uterus. Or they might be checking that a developing embryo has the right number of chromosomes, and that the embryo has a good chance of implanting in the uterus and coming out a baby with 10 fingers, 10 toes and the chance of a healthy life.</p>



<p>In the future, they might also use PGD to see whether a desired gene tweak, introduced via a gene-editing technique like CRISPR, has actually taken hold. Without PGD, none of these approaches, from disease prevention to designer babies, could take place.</p>



<p>Two days after putting Claudy’s five embryos in the incubator, only one is still undergoing cleavage. That is the embryo the doctors transfer to Claudy’s uterus in the autumn of 2018.</p>



<p>The embryo implants, and continues to develop the way any embryo would, no matter what its origin story — a ball of a few hundred genetically identical embryonic cells that eventually differentiate into the 200 or so cell types that make up a human being. The mechanism by which this occurs was first laid out in 1924 by the German investigator Hans Spemann, who discovered the “organizer effect” that leads particular regions of the embryo to develop into particular cell types.</p>



<p>In 1965, Beatrice Mintz created mice that wore their bizarre genetic lineage on their unique, black-and-white striped coats. In her lab at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/two-mothers-two-fathers">she created a mouse with four parents</a> — two mothers and two fathers — to demonstrate which parent’s genetic contribution ended up in which region of the body (<em>SN: 4/12/69, p. 361</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="black and white image of Beatrice Mintz looking into a microscope" class="wp-image-3100317" height="445" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_reprodcution_inline_mintz.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100317">Biologist Beatrice Mintz created thousands of four-parent mice, mixing different traits so she could trace the genetic origins of the distinctive organs that develop from the undifferentiated cells of a developing fetus.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100317">Smithsonian Institution/Flickr</span></figure>



<p>Mintz merged eight-celled embryos from two different mice, one pure black embryo and one pure white, by putting them into a lab dish, dissolving the protective layer around each embryo, and actually smooshing them together using a glass rod. The result was a mosaic mouse: Some of its cells contained genes that could be traced directly to the two white mouse parents, and some had genes from the two black mouse parents.</p>



<p>Other mysteries of how embryos develop were revealed by “knockout” technology, in which scientists disabled genes in a particular region of an embryo to see what those genes controlled. In 1995, developmental biologists William Shawlot and Richard Behringer of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston reported using this method in mouse embryos, confirming Spemann’s theory that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/absent-mouse-gene-leads-no-brainer">a tiny region of the embryo touches off changes in neighboring cells</a> to turn them into particular cell types (<em>SN: 4/1/95, p. 197</em>).</p>



<p>The embryo in Claudy’s uterus develops normally; everything about her pregnancy seems ordinary — except how miraculous it might feel to Claudy herself, who must have had some doubt, as a young breast cancer patient, about whether she’d ever have a baby of her own. In early July 2019, Claudy goes back to the Antoine Béclère University Hospital, this time to give birth. Her son is born on July 6; she and her partner name him Jules.</p>



<p>When Grynberg asks Claudy’s permission to write up her landmark case in the <em>Annals of Oncology</em>, she is overwhelmed. “I thought about everything I had gone through,” she told a reporter for the British newspaper the<em> Telegraph</em> as she posed for a photo with baby Jules. “And I cried as I realized how lucky I was.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Physically attractive people are routinely judged to be “superior” in other ways — to be more trustworthy, for example, and honest, and intelligent. However, evidence for the unwarranted “attractiveness halo” effect has tended to come from studies that have involved snap-judgements with no feedback or repercussions for the people doing the judging. Gayathri Pandey and Vivian Zayas at Cornell University, US, wanted to explore how this bias plays out in the longer term, when contradicted by actual data. If, say, we’re given information that an attractive investor is actually losing us money, while an unattractive investor is securing profits, surely we’ll quickly drop that bias in relation to these individual people at least? Alarmingly, the pair’s <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview">new paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> suggests not.</p>



<span id="more-42524"></span>



<p>In an initial study, 91 students were each shown four photos of purported “financial partners” (all of the same gender). Two of the composite faces had independently been rated as attractive and two as unattractive. The students were given a hypothetical $2000 and told to make as much money as possible. Across 50 trials with all male partners and another 50 with all female partners, they had to click on a face to choose one with whom to invest the money, and each time, they got feedback as to whether they’d lost or gained money.</p>



<p>Before they started, the students were informed that some of the partners would be more helpful than others. They were also encouraged to try them all, to find out which were better and which worse. What they were not told was that there were in fact two equally disadvantageous partners (who delivered some relatively large immediate gains but smaller long-term profits or even long-term losses) — one attractive and one unattractive — and two advantageous partners (who conferred better long-term profits), again, one attractive and one not.</p>



<p>As expected, the students started out favouring the attractive partners. But even after receiving 50 trials’ worth of feedback about the performance of each individual, they were still swayed by attractiveness. In fact, they preferred the attractive-<em>disadvantageous</em> partner over the unattractive-<em>advantageous </em>partner. They also reported finding the attractive partners more helpful. (There was some evidence of improved performance in the second block of trials, though the team’s analysis suggests that this reflected better use of the feedback, rather than getting significantly better at discounting attractiveness.)</p>



<p>Perhaps 50 trials weren’t enough for the participants to accurately discriminate between helpful vs unhelpful partners, and discount attractiveness, the researchers reasoned. So they ran another experiment, this time with 135 participants who each completed 100 trials (with either all male or all female partners).</p>



<p>The results were different — but not drastically so. As the participants progressed through the 100 rounds of feedback, they did come to show a preference for the advantageous partners. However, after suffering a loss, they were still quicker to return to an attractive vs unattractive partner, and by the end, the attractive-disadvantageous partner was still <em>as popular</em> a choice as the unattractive-advantageous one. “Even with more opportunity to learn about partners’ profitability, time did not appreciably moderate the effect of attractiveness,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>The participants were asked afterwards about how trustworthy they perceived the four partners to be. The attractive two were clearly favoured. In fact, the researchers’ analysis suggests that a perceived association between attractiveness and trustworthiness explained the results — we seem to use attractiveness as a signal of trustworthiness, and rely on it, even in the face of financial losses (albeit hypothetical ones).</p>



<p>It’s possible of course that with more trials, which could provide a clearer picture of trends in financial gains and losses, the attractiveness bias would have been eliminated. Only further research will tell. And as the researchers themselves note, a study that involved American college students, just White faces and hypothetical rather than real money is only a starting point for research in this area, rather than the final word. However, the new work certainly does suggest that the attractiveness halo colours our judgements, at a cost to ourselves, for far longer than might have been assumed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-map-neurons-connections-google-harvard">A deep look at a speck of human brain reveals never-before-seen quirks</a></h4>

<p>A new view of the human brain shows its cellular residents in all their wild and weird glory. The map, drawn from a tiny piece of a woman’s brain, charts the varied shapes of 50,000 cells and 130 million connections between them.</p>



<p>This intricate map, named H01 for “human sample 1,” represents a milestone in scientists’ quest to provide <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cataloging-connections">evermore detailed descriptions of a brain</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/14</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s absolutely beautiful,” says neuroscientist Clay Reid at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. “In the best possible way, it’s the beginning of something very exciting.”</p>



<p>Scientists at Harvard University, Google and elsewhere prepared and analyzed the brain tissue sample. Smaller than a sesame seed, the bit of brain was about a millionth of an entire brain’s volume. It came from the cortex — the brain’s outer layer responsible for complex thought — of a 45-year-old woman undergoing surgery for epilepsy. After it was removed, the brain sample was quickly preserved and stained with heavy metals that revealed cellular structures. The sample was then sliced into more than 5,000 wafer-thin pieces and imaged with powerful electron microscopes.</p>



<p>Computational programs stitched the resulting images back together and artificial intelligence programs helped scientists analyze them. A short <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.446289v1">description of the resulting view</a> was published as a preprint May 30 to bioRxiv.org. The full dataset is <a href="https://h01-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://h01-release/assets/library_state.json">freely available online</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="black background with green and purple nerve cells with lots of long tendrils" class="wp-image-3100345" height="342" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060421_ls_strong-synapses_inline1_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100345">These two neurons are mirror symmetrical. It’s unclear why these cells take these shapes. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100345">Lichtman Lab/Harvard University, Connectomics Team/Google</span></figure>



<p>For now, researchers are just beginning to see what’s there. “We have really just dipped our toe into this dataset,” says study coauthor Jeff Lichtman, a developmental neurobiologist at Harvard University. Lichtman compares the brain map to Google Earth: “There are gems in there to find, but no one can say they’ve looked at the whole thing.”</p>



<p>But already, some “fantastically interesting” sights have appeared, Lichtman says. “When you have large datasets, suddenly these odd things, these weird things, these rare things start to stand out.”</p>





<p>One such curiosity concerns synapses, connection spots where signals move between nerve cells. Usually, most message-sending axons touch a message-receiving dendrite just once. In the new dataset, about 90 percent of the connections were these one-hit contacts. Some pairs of cells have slightly more contacts. But every so often, researchers spotted cells that connect multiple times, including one pair that were linked by a whopping 19 synapses.</p>



<p>Multiple connections have been spotted in mouse brains, though not quite as abundantly as in this human sample. And fly brains can also have many connections between cells, though they’re more dispersed than the newly described human connections, says neuroscientist Pat Rivlin of Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va. There, Rivlin works on the FlyEM Project, which aims to create detailed maps of the fruit fly nervous system.</p>



<p>The large dataset on the human brain provides a breakdown of just how common these types of connections are, says Reid. And that raises the question of what these extraordinarily strong synapses might be doing in the brain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="black background with purple clumps coiled and connected" class="wp-image-3100346" height="342" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060421_ls_strong-synapses_inline2_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100346">In their new database of human brain tissue, researchers found examples of unusual whorled nerve cell tendrils (purple), coiled like snakes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100346">Lichtman Lab/Harvard University, Connectomics Team/Google</span></figure>



<p>These cells might be able to compel their target cell into action in a powerful way, Lichtman speculates. Perhaps rote information, such as knowing 5 times 5 is 25 or knowing to stop at a red light, relies on these powerful inputs that efficiently drive information through the brain.</p>



<p>Molecular neuroscientist Seth Grant at the University of Edinburgh points out that although the map is a valuable tool, it shows only the anatomy of the brain. Other research will help clarify the function and composition of molecules that drive brain behavior. For now, the map is “very much an exploratory tool,” he says.</p>



<p>One curiosity to explore further is the team’s observation of two nerve cells, or neurons, that appeared to be entwined in a symmetrical dance. The images also revealed message-sending axons of neurons forming elaborate coils, unusual and mysterious whorls that look like coiled snakes. “We had just never seen anything like it,” Lichtman says. Once the researchers knew how to look for these coils, more and more turned up.</p>



<p>These extremely detailed brain maps are a culmination of years of research, says Reid, who is working on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experiment-live-human-brain-helps-scientists-map-nerve-cells">maps of mouse and human brains at the Allen Institute</a> (<em>SN: 8/7/19</em>). “It’s this magical time in history” when the map-making tools, such as computational methods, machine learning and powerful microscopes, are all available, Reid says. “This work is just beginning to see the light of day.”</p>



<p>What these maps will ultimately reveal is still anybody’s guess. Lichtman is circumspect about whether these maps will lead to a deep understanding of the brain. “I think the best we can do is describe,” he says. “I hope that at some point, we will get to a place where we are no longer surprised by what we see.”</p>

Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster access.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command line.</p>
<p>The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange questions.</p>
<p>* While MacOS has switched from <code>bash</code> to <code>zsh</code> as its default shell, <code>zsh</code><span class="quo">‘</span>s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all set.</p>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">enable <span class="caps">WSL2</span></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6">install Ubuntu</a> as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and patience)</li>
<li>The grammar of a shell command line</li>
<li>Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: <code>~</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pushd</code>/<code>popd</code>, <code>ssh</code></li>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software development.</p>
<p>This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code errors.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be required.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.</p>
<p>This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We’ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice.</p>

A lab leak theory of the COVID-19 origins has enough circumstantial evidence and historical basis to support the urgent need for an independent and unbiased investigation. But until recently, scientists dismissed lab leak as a conspiracy theory. In public at least.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canary-immune-system-sight-illness-sick-birds">The mere sight of illness may kick-start a canary’s immune system</a></h4>

<p>For canaries, just seeing their feathered friends get sick may be enough to preemptively rev up their immune systems.</p>



<p>Healthy birds housed within view of fellow fowl infected with a common pathogen <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0125">mounted an immune response</a>, despite not being infected themselves, researchers report online June 9 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. </p>



<p>“It’s fascinating that some sort of visual cue could alter immune function,” says Ashley Love, a disease ecologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Precisely how much these alterations actually protect the birds remains unclear, she says.</p>



<p>Immune systems are like sentinels, patrolling the body for invaders and calling in the cavalry once a pathogen is detected. Traditionally, pathogens have to actually get into bodies to spur that sort of response.</p>





<p>But some research has previously hinted that perceived threats can whip up immune cells. For example, one experiment in humans found that a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610368064">mere photo of a sick person</a> increases the activity of inflammation-stimulating chemicals called cytokines. But no one had ever looked to see whether being within eyeshot of an actually sick individual could compel the immune system to preemptive action, Love says.</p>



<p>“A lot of wildlife diseases have these obvious physical symptoms,” she says. If wild animals can prepare, immunologically, at the first sign they might become infected, they may be better equipped to fight off the invader once it comes.</p>





<p>To test this idea, Love and her colleagues infected 10 caged canaries (<em>Serinus canaria domestica</em>) with <em>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</em>, or MG, a common bacterial pathogen that causes conjunctivitis and extreme lethargy. Sick birds look “pretty fluffed out,” Love says. </p>



<p>Nine healthy birds were housed in direct view of their sick brethren, but far enough away to avoid infection, which requires direct contact. An identical setup, but with all healthy birds, was located in the same room but on the other side of an opaque divider. Over the course of a month, researchers collected blood samples from the birds, measured various aspects of immune activity and tracked how sick the infected birds looked. </p>



<p>As healthy birds witnessed neighbors becoming visibly sick, their immune systems stirred. A measure of the birds’ ability to burst foreign cells, called CH50 complement activity, rose in conjunction with how sick the infected birds appeared. White blood cell counts were also significantly different in birds exposed to sick individuals, rather than healthy ones. Cytokine levels did not differ between the two groups.</p>



<p>Blood tests showed that no healthy birds caught MG during the experiment, suggesting that some sort of external cue altered immune function. That cue was likely visual, Love says. The smells and sounds of the sick could reach all birds in the experiment, but only the birds in direct view of the ill birds showed an immune response. </p>



<p>“This was a pretty convincing study,” says Dana Hawley, a disease ecologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who wasn’t involved in the research. Lots of animals avoid infection by social distancing, she says. For instance, lobsters steer clear of dens occupied by sick individuals, and the house finches that Hawley studies avoid individuals who appear ill.</p>



<p>But social distancing has its costs, especially for highly social species. </p>



<p>For species that forage together, or rely on safety in numbers, ramping up an immune response at the mere sight of illness might confer some protection while still allowing the animals to get up close and personal. </p>



<p>“It’s great to avoid a pathogen,” Hawley says, “but if you can’t find food or [you] get taken by a predator, it doesn’t really matter.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-electrons-space-magnetic-field-waves-earth">Auroras form when electrons from space ride waves in Earth’s magnetic field</a></h4>

<p>By re-creating the conditions for an aurora in the lab, researchers have confirmed how these bright, shimmery curtains of light form.</p>



<p>The northern lights arise when electrons from space <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve">cascade into the upper atmosphere</a>, where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules to paint the sky red and green (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>). But it has been difficult to discern what, exactly, draws those electrons down toward Earth. For decades, scientists have suspected that electrons ride ripples in Earth’s magnetic field, called Alfvén waves, into the atmosphere, like tiny surfers catching waves to shore. But no satellite has ever directly observed this happening.</p>



<p>A new experiment that accelerated electrons with Alfvén waves offers the first direct evidence that these disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5">can push electrons into the atmosphere to cause auroras</a>, plasma physicist James Schroeder and colleagues report online June 7 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="wavy lines on a blue background, with yellow dots" class="wp-image-3100331" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060721_MT_aurora_inline-680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100331">Ripples called Alfvén waves in Earth’s magnetic field (illustrated as blue squiggles) can sweep electrons (yellow) from space into Earth’s atmosphere to light up auroras — similar to the way ocean waves push surfers to shore.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100331">Austin Montelius/University of Iowa</span></figure>



<p>The team filled a 20-meter-long, 1-meter-wide tube with a soup of charged particles, or plasma. Electrical coils created a magnetic field running the length of the chamber. An antenna at one end of the instrument generated its own magnetic field, which essentially plucked the magnetic field lines within the canister to send Alfvén waves rippling through the plasma.</p>



<p>As expected, electrons in the plasma got swept up in the Alfvén waves and accelerated down the chamber. What’s more, “the energy gained per electron per second was similar, in our experiment, to what would be needed out in space to create an aurora,” says Schroeder, of Wheaton College in Illinois.</p>



<p>These results not only confirm the physics behind atmospheric light shows on Earth, Schroeder says. “What’s happening here could very likely be happening at Jupiter, or anywhere else, like Saturn, where we see auroras.”</p>

<p>The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime location to conduct oceanographic research and features a wealth of scientific expertise. However, as in many institutions, the pool of oceanographic researchers can be quite homogenous. UCT researchers <a href="https://katyealtieri.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Katye Altieri</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Fawcett</a> and <a href="http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Isabelle Ansorge</a> realized that while the academic staff in the Department of Oceanography at UCT is comprised of ~50% womxn, it is 100% white. Furthermore, in 2019, amongst postgraduates in the department, there were only 12 Black African and Coloured South African womxn out of 73 students. The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of ‘otherness’ can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community. Altieri says that she and her colleagues saw an opportunity to create “a dedicated programme that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south”. The three womxn joined forces with <a href="http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsleter-archives/2011/february2011/doc05" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Juliet Hermes</a> from the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and they decided to apply for a grant from the Advancing Womxn initiative, created by UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamokgethi_Phakeng" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mamokgethi Phakeng.</a> </p>



<p>The result is <a href="https://oceanwomxn.co.za/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Ocean Womxn</strong></a>, a program funded for an 5 year initial period, that aims to remove barriers and provide support for Black womxn in oceanography. In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows receive comprehensive support – this includes financial cover for the duration of their degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They also have sea-going opportunities, such as SEAmester cruises, where they can develop lab skills and receive hands-on experience. Additionally, they are offered the option of swimming, boating and scuba lessons. </p>



<p>PLOS ONE recently spoke with some of the <a href="https://oceanwomxn.co.za/cohort-2020" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ocean Womxn Fellows</a> to learn more about the program and how it has impacted their journey as early career oceanographers. </p>

<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I would definitely say the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is definitely the exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.<em>  </em> </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong><em> </em>Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a “burden of service”, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a “burden of service”, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project Kuongoza Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now “serving” my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa: </strong>Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of “burden of service” I have the responsibility to “teach” science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large. </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and honour for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD! </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa’s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women! </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?  </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa: </strong>Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet. </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science: to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the “openness” of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication? </p>

<p><strong>Lunar quarantine dropped</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/aerospace-28"><em>Science News</em></a>, May 8, 1971</p>



<p>Spacecraft and men from Earth can contaminate space … with Earth-related material or organisms. But there is also a chance material returned from another celestial body could contain something harmful to the Earth…. Last week [NASA] announced it will [recommend] … that “further lunar missions need not be subject to quarantine” [because] … “there is no hazard to man, animal or plants” from anything brought back from the moon. </p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The last U.S. lunar mission to come back to Earth, Apollo 17, didn’t have to quarantine upon return in 1972. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-rules-guarding-other-planets-contamination-may-be-too-strict">missions <em>to</em> the moon remained under strict protocols</a> to prevent spacecraft from contaminating it. In 2020, NASA exempted most of the moon — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/apollo-astronauts-anniversary-trash-mementos-experiments-moon">minus areas of scientific interest and historic sites</a> — from those rules (<em>SN: 11/23/19, p. 10</em>). For missions to other planets, though, strict anti­contamination measures still apply. NASA has called for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life">research of possible risks</a> as it aims to land humans on Mars in the 2030s.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Having a new baby is never easy: it’s difficult to manage the stress of birth, sleepless nights, and juggling of childcare and domestic responsibilities, especially for first-time parents. Some also experience postnatal depression, which is estimated to affect 23% of women in Europe after the birth of a child (men also experience postnatal depression, though the numbers are not so clear).</p>



<p>Add to new parenting the impact of lockdown, and that figure could rise sharply, a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002/full">new study</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> suggests. Working with women with babies aged six months or younger in the UK during the first COVID-19 lockdown, UCL’s Sarah Myers and Emily H. Emmott found that almost half met the threshold for postnatal depression — double the average European rates.</p>



<span id="more-42503"></span>



<p>Participants were 162 London-based women aged between 19 and 47 years old; half were first-time mothers, while the other half had up to three other children. Women first filled in a survey which measured symptoms of postnatal depression, then shared their own personal social networks, listing up to 25 people and explaining who they were and what the relationship was.</p>



<p>After sharing this information, participants also reported who in this network they had seen in person and who they had chatted with on the phone, via video call, or by text or WhatsApp over the last few weeks. Contacts included family, old friends, colleagues and so-called “mummy friends” — non-family female friends who also had children of the same age.</p>



<p>The results showed high levels of depressive symptoms among the new mothers, with 47.5% reporting symptoms that met the threshold of diagnosis of postnatal depression (34.6% of the group reported particularly high levels of symptoms).</p>



<p>In terms of social networks, participants (like many non-parents) saw few people during the weeks leading up to the survey. On average, women had seen one family member, three other general friends, and no “mummy friends”, though they were speaking to many different social contacts via social media, phone call or text. Many women were going without support from family members, however — 47.5% had seen no relatives at all.</p>



<p>Social contact was also linked to depressive symptoms: the more social contacts participants saw in person, the less likely they were to report symptoms of postnatal depression, suggesting a link between social isolation and depression.</p>



<p>The team also explored the experience of new parenthood during lockdown through open-ended questions about how the pandemic had affected mothers’ self-esteem and their relationships with their babies. Some mothers felt positively about lockdown, stating that it had given them more quality time with their baby and an increase in time partners were home and able to help with childcare. “It has been a great help having my partner home every day as it means most days I can get at least an hour to myself which I use to exercise or catch up on sleep,” one woman wrote. “Also I think it has been an amazing positive on my partner’s ability to build a bond with the baby and co-parent.”</p>



<p>However, in concordance with the high levels of depressive symptoms, other mothers struggled. Some felt a “constant burden” of parenting (“I think lockdown has made me feel like I’m not a person in my own right anymore, just a mum”), while others pointed to the relative inadequacy of online support. One woman pointed to the many video calls and chats she had during this period — but noted that the physical isolation of lockdown led to a lack of practical advice and support.</p>



<p>Finally, others saw lockdown as a time of “lost opportunities”. “You’re only a first time mum once, and I was really looking forward to this time and making new mum friends,” one woman wrote. “I think I am most sad about missing out on that.” Others pointed to worries about development — concerns about whether children would recognise family members having only met them on FaceTime, missing physical and mental milestones, and lack of play with other children.</p>



<p>The team points to two key insights: firstly, that it “takes a village” to raise a child, with social networks crucial to supporting both parents and babies in the time after birth; and secondly, that the impact of COVID-19 on new parents should be considered in healthcare interventions, with key focus on face-to-face, rather than digital, support from health and social care services.</p>



<p>Overall, the study highlights the unique (and incredibly stressful) circumstances into which new parents were thrust during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now that lockdown has eased, the results suggest, it may be an opportune time to reach out to new parents in your own social networks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-fda-approved-controversy-aducanumab">FDA approved a new Alzheimer’s drug despite controversy over whether it works</a></h4>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a controversial Alzheimer’s treatment, the first that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-drug">promises to slow the disease’s destruction</a> in the brain, not just improve symptoms.</p>



<p>The drug, aducanumab, is also the first new Alzheimer’s treatment approved since 2003. It doesn’t cure or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, which affects more than 6 million people in the United States and is projected to affect nearly 13 million people by 2050.</p>



<p>The drug’s path to approval hasn’t been smooth. In 2019, aducanumab was nearly scrapped after it appeared unlikely to succeed in two large clinical trials. But after reanalyzing more data that came in later, the drug’s developer, Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., saw signs that indicated the drug might work after all, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/once-scrapped-alzheimers-drug-aducanumab-may-work-after-all">decided to pursue FDA approval</a> (<em>SN: 12/5/19</em>).</p>



<p>Still, today’s decision concerns some doctors and scientists who see the FDA’s move as premature because they aren’t convinced that the drug, also known as Aduhelm, actually works. Approving a drug that’s not effective would set Alzheimer’s research back and offer patients false hope, those experts argue.</p>





<p>“This is a great day for Biogen and its shareholders, but a bleak day for the field of Alzheimer’s research,” says Michael Greicius, a neurologist at Stanford University. Pushing forward on the “illusion of progress,” he says, “will come at a cost to genuine progress in finding an effective treatment for this devastating disease.”</p>



<p>Others disagree that the evidence is slim, and are elated about having a new tool to fight a disease that has eluded an effective treatment for so long. “We have been waiting decades for this,” says neuroscientist Maria Carrillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer’s Association in Chicago. A drug that delays decline due to Alzheimer’s promises patients and their families time “to sustain independence, to hold onto memories longer, to be with families longer,” she says. “That’s important.”</p>



<p>The drug, which is administered intravenously, is a lab-made antibody that targets small and large clumps of the sticky protein amyloid-beta. Some researchers suspect that in Alzheimer’s, A-beta scrambles connections between nerve cells and damages brain tissue, ultimately causing Alzheimer’s symptoms. But that idea, called the amyloid hypothesis, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memories-cant-wait">still unsettled</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/11</em>).</p>



<p>Brain scans reveal that aducanumab is effective at reducing A-beta in the brain. What’s less clear is whether this reduction comes with consistent improvements in people’s quality of life. That uncertainty led an FDA advisory panel to object strongly to the drug’s approval. In November, that group concluded that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-advisory-panel-declines-support-controversial-alzheimers-drug">the evidence was too weak</a> to show that the drug effectively treated Alzheimer’s (<em>SN: 11/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>Aducanumab comes with potentially serious side effects. Brain scans show that about 40 percent of people who received the highest dose of aducanumab in a clinical trial had swelling or bleeding in the brain. While most of those people had no symptoms, some had headaches, nausea and dizziness. </p>

<blockquote><p>Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.</p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gut-microbe-food-malnourished-children">Food that boosts gut microbes could be a new way to help malnourished kids</a></h4>

<p>In the densely populated slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh, children survive on rice cooked with curry powder and cheap cookies and chips, packaged in appealing, colorful wrappers. These protein-poor foods provide scarce nutrients for growing bodies. Add in poor sanitation from multiple generations of a family often living in a single room and no access to health care, and these hardships are etched in these children’s malnourished bodies.</p>



<p>“This is what life is like in these places,” says Tahmeed Ahmed, who heads the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh.</p>



<p>Dhaka is far from unique. According to <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/#:~:text=In%202020*%2C%2022%20per%20cent,203.6%20million%20to%20149.2%20million.">UNICEF</a>, more than 1 in 5 children under age 5, or 149.2 million, are coping with undernutrition — a form of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-progress-combating-child-malnutrition-masks-problem-spots">malnutrition most common in low- and middle-income countries</a> (<em>SN: 1/8/20</em>). Undernutrition leaves children stunted, or short for their age, and wasted, underweight for their height. And it can be deadly: Globally, 5.2 million children under age 5 died in 2019; 45 percent of those <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/children-reducing-mortality#:~:text=Children%20under%20the%20age%20of%205&amp;text=The%20total%20number%20of%20under,1990%20to%2038%20in%202019.">deaths are linked to nutrition-related issues</a>, according to the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was expected to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30229-1/fulltext">make things worse</a>, disrupting nutrition programs and families’ ability to find and afford food, researchers reported in May 2020 in the <em>Lancet Global Health</em>.</p>





<p>It’s still too early to know the toll the pandemic has had on child malnutrition. But “we are not yet out of the woods in many countries,” says Denish Moorthy, a senior technical advisor on global nutrition initiatives for John Snow Inc., a Boston-based public health management consulting and research organization.   </p>



<p>Yet in Dhaka, there is a glimmer of hope. Children fed a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2023294?rss=searchAndBrowse">new kind of food supplement</a>, aimed at not only nourishing them but restoring helpful bacteria in their guts, gained more weight on average than children fed traditional high-caloric supplements, Ahmed and his colleagues reported in a preliminary study April 7 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. In six months, the researchers hope to have results that determine whether those gains persist.</p>



<p>The approach is based on more than a decade of work, led by Jeffrey Gordon, a microbiologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-malnutrition-may-impair-infants-mix-gut-microbes">whether disruptions in our gut microbiota could cause malnutrition</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/14</em>). The team has found that malnourished babies lack beneficial gut microbes, and the problem lingers even after the babies are fed foods designed to boost their weight. Those gut microbes are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inside-job">important for metabolism, immunity, digestion and overall development</a>, so the lack of them stymies efforts to help these kids catch up (<em>SN: 6/3/11</em>). </p>



<p>In Bangladesh, Gordon’s team set out to create a microbiome-based food supplement by testing foods common to the local diet and seeing which foods boosted healthy bacteria.  The team also tested a way to measure the food’s impact by characterizing the gut bacteria in healthy and malnourished children and developing a pattern of markers in the blood. This pattern let the team understand how undernutrition changes the body, and also track gut microbiome changes.</p>



<p>The researchers then put their food to the test in the Dhaka slum of Mirpur. There, 118 undernourished children ages 12 to 18 months received either the gut microbe–friendly food or a more traditional ready-to-use supplementary food twice a day for three months.</p>



<p>The microbe-friendly food contained fewer calories than the commonly used supplementary food — 204 calories per 50-gram daily dose compared with 247 calories. Even so, researchers used a specialized score to show that children on the microbe-friendly food increased weight-for-length by 0.011 points faster than those given the ready-to-use supplement. If this growth rate was projected out to a year, it would be good enough to move these children into the normal range, says Gordon. Blood markers linked to bone growth, nervous system development and overall health improved. And a stool comparison showed that these children’s microbiomes looked like those of healthy Bangladeshi children. The results suggest the microbe-friendly food could help children’s bodies turn back the clock on the ill effects of undernutrition, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Malnutrition has been around for decades and efforts to combat it haven’t made much of a dent, says Moorthy, who was not involved in the research. “Malnutrition is not just about providing food, no matter how great the food is or about amazing results in trials,” he says. “This is the first step toward understanding some of the biology better and that is key.”</p>



<p>Gordon’s team is now working with nutrition scientists in India and with the WHO to expand the trial to other parts of the world. Back in Dhaka, Ahmed is encouraged by the results. After 35 years of treating children with malnutrition, he says he could see the difference in children taking the microbe-friendly supplement. You can also see it, he says, in the “gratitude and happiness on the face of the mothers.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Where were you at 8am two Tuesdays ago? If it’s a little tricky to recall, what if I presented you with a map with four location flags to choose from, each about 3-4 km apart, with one marking your actual location on that time and date?  Are you confident that you’d pick the right one?</p>



<p>If you <em>are</em> confident, the good news from a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> is that you’re more likely to be right than if you’re not too sure. The bad news is that when a group of students in Melbourne, Australia was tested in this way, they picked the wrong location 36% of the time. The study shows that this type of memory is pretty fallible — and yet it’s the type, of course, that’s needed for a criminal alibi. Failures in recalling where you were have no doubt contributed to serious miscarriages of justice, write Elizabeth Laliberte at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues.</p>



<span id="more-42494"></span>



<p>The 51 students all downloaded onto their phones an app that had been developed by two of the researchers. Over a four week period, this app continuously tracked their movement and orientation, and also took GPS location and audio snapshots every ten minutes. Software stripped any speech from these audio files, but preserved background noise, such as birdsong or building work. (The app was designed to keep raw participant data confidential from even the researchers, and the participants were able to pause data collection for periods.)</p>



<p>After a week’s delay, the participants were tested, again via the app. For each of 72 trials, they had to pick where they were on a specific time and date from four markers on a Google map. (They were able to zoom in and out and pan as they pleased). One of these markers represented the correct location, and the other three represented places they’d been on other occasions.</p>



<p>The team’s analysis revealed that, as a group, the students were correct only about two-thirds of the time. Accuracy did increase with confidence, a finding that supports the idea that (under certain circumstances) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/08/public-belief-in-memory-myths-not-actually-that-widespread-study-argues/">greater confidence is linked to better memory</a>. But the far from perfect performance of these university students, with presumably fairly regular schedules, doesn’t bode well for the rest of us — especially people without regular office hours.</p>



<p>The team highlights the case of American man Ronald Cotton, who in 1985 was convicted on charges of rape and burglary and sentenced to life plus 50 years in prison. Ten years after the conviction, DNA evidence exonerated him. Cotton’s initial defence had not been helped when his alibi had been shown to be false. “Rather than report where he’d been at the time of the crime, Cotton mistakenly recalled where he had been the week before. The error probably contributed significantly to his wrongful conviction,” the researchers write.  </p>



<p>The team’s analysis suggests that this error is relatively common: choosing a “right-day, wrong-week” location accounted for 19% of their participants’ errors. Participants also frequently chose a location that matched the stipulated hour but got the day wrong — this error accounted for 8% of the mistakes. (They also sometimes picked an incorrect location in which they had made similar patterns of movement or where the background sounds were similar to the correct location — though these errors were less common). “Both of these figures are well above chance rates and suggest that the error that Ronald Cotton made might be quite common,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Clearly, the findings could have practical, legal applications. Knowing just how fallible this type of alibi memory is — and understanding the most common errors that people make — could help lawyers to ask the right questions of defendants and witnesses, to try to get closer to the truth of where someone really was at a certain time.  </p>



<p>But there are more general implications for understanding memory, and for the way that memory research is done. Experiments are often lab-based, raising questions about real-world applicability. Passive, unobtrusive, privacy-conscious monitoring technologies like this new app could be used to gather and analyse all kinds of real-world data. As the researchers write, “We are now able to capture the ground truth of people’s lives and to test their ability to retain those events.” And this, they hope, could change how a good deal of memory research is done.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/staghorn-fern-colonies-first-plants-share-work-ants">These ferns may be the first plants known to share work like ants</a></h4>

<p>High in the forest canopy, a mass of strange ferns grips a tree trunk, looking like a giant tangle of floppy, viridescent antlers. Below these fork-leaved fronds and closer into the core of the lush knot are brown, disk-shaped plants. These, too, are ferns of the very same species.</p>



<p>The ferns — and possibly similar plants — <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3373">may form a type of complex, interdependent society</a> previously considered limited to animals like ants and termites, researchers report online May 14 in <em>Ecology</em>. </p>



<p>Kevin Burns, a biologist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, first became familiar with the ferns while conducting fieldwork on Lord Howe Island, an isolated island between Australia and New Zealand. He happened to take note of the local epiphytes — plants that grow upon other plants — and one species particularly caught his attention: the staghorn fern <a>(<em>Platycerium bifurcatum</em>)</a>, also native to parts of mainland Australia and Indonesia.</p>



<p>“I realized, God, you know, they never occur alone,” says Burns, noting that some of the larger clusters of ferns were massive clumps made of hundreds of individuals. </p>





<p>It was soon clear to Burns that “each one of those individuals was doing a different thing.”</p>



<p>He likens the fern colonies to an upside-down umbrella made of plants. Ferns with long, green, waxy “strap” fronds appeared to deflect water to the center of the aggregation, where disk-shaped, brown, spongey “nest” fronds could soak it up.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="staghorn fern colony on an island cedar tree" class="wp-image-3100186" height="856" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060121_jb_eusocial-plants_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100186">A colony of common staghorn ferns (<em>Platycerium bifurcatum</em>) grows in the forest canopy on an island cedar tree (<em>Guioa coriacea</em>), its brown, absorbent nest fronds at the bottom and core of the colony, and green strap fronds projecting outwards.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100186">Ian Hutton</span></figure></div>



<p>The shrubby apparatus reminded Burns of a termite mound, with a communal store of resources and the segregation of different jobs in the colony. Scientists call these types of cooperative groups, where overlapping generations live together and form castes to divide labor and reproductive roles, “eusocial.” The term has been used to describe certain insect and crustacean societies, along with two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-mammal-joins-eusocial-club">mole rat species</a> as the only mammalian examples (<em>SN: 10/18/04</em>). Burns wondered if the ferns could also be eusocial.</p>



<p>His team’s analysis of frond fertility revealed 40 percent couldn’t reproduce, and the sterile colony members were predominantly nest fronds. This suggests a reproductive division of labor between the nest and strap frond types. Tests of the fronds’ absorbency confirmed that nest fronds sop up more water than strap fronds do. Previous research by other scientists found networks of roots running throughout the colony, which means that nest fronds have the ability to slake strap fronds’ thirst. The fronds divided labor, much like ants and termites.</p>



<p>The team also analyzed genetic samples from 10 colonies on Lord Howe Island and found that eight were composed of genetically identical individuals, while two contained ferns of differing genetic origins. High degrees of genetic relatedness are also seen in colonies of eusocial insects, where many sisters contribute to the survival of the nest.</p>



<p>Taken together, Burns thinks these traits tick many of the boxes for eusociality. That would be a “big deal,” he says.</p>



<p>An assumed requirement for eusocial colonial living is behavioral coordination, because it allows different individuals to work together. But ferns are plants, not animals, which so often coordinate their behaviors. Seeing eusocial living in plants “seems to indicate to me that this type of transition in the evolution of complexity doesn’t require a brain,” Burns says.</p>



<p>The study opens up the “opportunity to look at [epiphytes] with the lens of eusociality,” which is “really cool,” says Michelle Spicer, an ecologist at the University of Puget Sound in Washington who was not involved with this study.</p>



<p>Spicer points out that water and nutrient exchange is known in other epiphytic plants. Though, Burns notes that the division of labor to build communal resources “appears to be a key feature that sets staghorn [ferns] apart from other colonial plants.” </p>





<p>A stressful life in the canopy — far away from the soil — may have contributed to the ferns’ evolution of eusociality by providing water and nutrient security, Burns says.</p>



<p>“The epiphyte lifestyle certainly facilitates group living, and group living is where all social stories start,” says Brian Whyte, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Berkeley also not involved with this research.</p>



<p>These ferns could certainly fit the definition of eusociality, Whyte says. He is particularly fascinated by how the plants form castes and colonies in the wild but remain as individual strap fronds when grown in soil as ornamental plants. This variability differs from many eusocial species, he says. </p>



<p>Burns and his colleagues are currently investigating if strap fronds can become nest fronds after being transplanted to another part of the colony. Burns also wants to study another staghorn fern species in Madagascar that appears to also grow in colonies. </p>



<p>Whyte sees major benefits in broadening a view of eusociality to include plants. </p>



<p>“It’s so nice to be able to notice something and be like ‘wait, this is comparable to some of the coolest, most advanced societies in the living world,’” he says. Regardless of where the ferns sit on the eusociality spectrum, he notes, they still have intriguing similarities and differences to caste-forming animals. “Learning more about [these ferns] will improve our theories on why these characteristics have evolved across the diversity of life.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-clock-atomic-most-precise-time-physics">Nuclear clocks could outdo atomic clocks as the most precise timepieces</a></h4>

<p>Nuclear clocks could be the GOAT: Greatest of all timepieces.</p>



<p>If physicists can build them, nuclear clocks would be a brand-new type of clock, one that would keep time based on the physics of atoms’ hearts. Today’s most precise clocks, called atomic clocks, rely on the behavior of atoms’ electrons. But a clock based on atomic nuclei could reach 10 times the precision of those atomic clocks, researchers estimate.</p>



<p>Better clocks could improve technologies that depend on them, <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP21/Session/Q02.4">such as GPS navigation</a>, physicist Peter Thirolf said June 3 during an online meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. But “it’s not just about timekeeping.” Unlike atoms’ electrons, atomic nuclei are subject to the strong nuclear force, which holds protons and neutrons together. “A nuclear clock sees a different part of the world,” said Thirolf, of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in Germany. That means nuclear clocks could allow new tests of fundamental ideas in physics, including whether supposedly immutable numbers in physics known as fundamental constants are, in fact, constant.</p>



<p>Atomic clocks tally time using the energy jumps of atoms’ electrons. According to quantum physics, electrons in atoms can carry only certain amounts of energy, in specific energy levels. To bump electrons in an atom from one energy level to another, an atomic clock’s atoms must be hit with laser light of just the right frequency. That frequency — the rate of oscillation of the light’s electromagnetic waves — serves as a highly precise timekeeper.</p>





<p>Like the electrons in an atom, the protons and neutrons within atomic nuclei also occupy discrete energy levels. Nuclear clocks would be based on jumps between those nuclear energy levels, rather than those of electrons. Notably, nuclei are resistant to the effects of stray electric or magnetic fields that can hinder atomic clocks. As a result, nuclear clocks “would be more stable and more accurate,” says theoretical physicist Adriana Pálffy of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany.</p>



<p>But there’s a problem. To tally time with nuclei, scientists need to be able to set off the jump between nuclear energy levels with a laser. “Nuclear levels are not normally accessible with lasers,” said theoretical physicist Marianna Safronova of the University of Delaware in a June 2 talk at the meeting. For most nuclei, that would require light of higher energy than suitable lasers can achieve. Luckily, there’s <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP21/Session/M04.2">one lone exception</a> in all of the known nuclei, Safronova said, “a freak-of-nature thing.” A variety of thorium called thorium-229 has a pair of energy levels close enough in energy that a laser could potentially set off the jump.</p>



<p>Recent measurements have more precisely pinpointed the energy of that jump, a crucial step toward building a thorium nuclear clock. Thirolf and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1533-4">estimated the energy</a> by measuring electrons emitted when the nucleus jumps between the two levels, as reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2019. And in a 2020 paper in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, physicist Andreas Fleischmann and colleagues measured other energy jumps the thorium nucleus can make, subtracting them to <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.142503">deduce the energy of the nuclear clock </a>jump.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="microscope image of detectors" class="wp-image-3100206" height="397" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060321_ec_nuclearclock_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100206">An array of highly sensitive detectors (shown in a false-color scanning electron microscope image) measured the energy of light emitted when thorium-229 atoms jumped between energy levels. Those measurements allowed Andreas Fleischmann and colleagues to estimate the energy of the jump that physicists aim to use to make a nuclear clock.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100206">Matthäus Krantz</span></figure>



<p>The teams agree that the jump is just over 8 electron volts in energy. That energy corresponds to ultraviolet light in a range for which setting off the jump with a laser is possible, but at the edge of scientists’ capabilities.</p>



<p>Now that physicists know the size of the energy jump, they are aiming to trigger it with lasers. At the meeting, physicist Chuankun Zhang of the research institute JILA in Boulder, Colo., reported efforts to use a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-ultrafast-laser-emits-pulses-light-30-billion-times-second">frequency comb</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/18</em>) — a method of creating an array of discrete frequencies of laser light — to initiate the jump and <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP21/Session/S03.8">measure its energy</a> even better. “If it’s a success, we can directly build a nuclear-based optical clock from that,” he said at the meeting. Thirolf’s team also is working with frequency combs, aiming for a working nuclear clock within the next five years.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Pálffy is looking into using what’s called an “electronic bridge.” Rather than using a laser to directly initiate an energy jump by the nucleus, the laser would first excite the electrons, which would then <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP21/Session/Q02.2">transfer energy to the nucleus</a>, Pálffy reported at the meeting.</p>



<p>Nuclear clocks could let researchers devise new tests to determine if fundamental constants of nature vary over time. For example, some studies have suggested that the fine-structure constant, a number that sets the strength of electromagnetic interactions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">could change</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>). “This nuclear clock <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP21/Session/Q02.1">is a perfect system</a> to search for variation of fundamental constants,” Victor Flambaum of the University of New South Wales in Sydney said at the meeting. The devices could also test a foundation of Einstein’s general theory of relativity called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-galileo-gravity-experiment-re-created-space-einstein">equivalence principle</a> (<em>SN: 12/4/17</em>). Or they could search for dark matter, elusive undetected particles that physicists believe account for most of the universe’s matter, which could tweak the ticking of the clock.</p>



<p>The potential of nuclear clocks is so promising that for Fleischmann, of Heidelberg University in Germany, it took just an instant to settle on tackling the quandary of how scientists could build a nuclear clock, he says. It was “from the very first second clear that this is a question that one should work on.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies">After 40 years of AIDS, here’s why we still don’t have an HIV vaccine</a></h4>

<p>Forty years ago, researchers described the mysterious cases of five gay men who had fallen ill with a pneumonia caused by the fungus<em> Pneumocystis carinii</em>. Two of the five men had already died.</p>



<p>That type of pneumonia usually <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm">affects only individuals who are severely immunocompromised</a>, researchers wrote in the June 5, 1981 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Scientists would soon discover that a disease that would come to be known as AIDS was devastating the men’s immune systems.</p>



<p>Three years later, scientists pinned the blame for AIDS on a virus dubbed HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. Margaret Heckler, the then-U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an April 1984 news conference that a vaccine to build protection against the virus would be ready to test within two years, holding out promise that protection was on its way.   </p>



<p>We’re still waiting.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, the HIV pandemic, which probably <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6205/56">got its start in Congo in the 1920s</a>, has led to devastating loss. More than 75 million people have been infected around the world as of the end of 2019. Approximately 32.7 million people have died.</p>



<p>That toll would undoubtedly be much higher if it weren’t for advances in antiviral treatments that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-monthly-treatment-antiretroviral-therapy-shot">prevent infected people from dying</a> from HIV and from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-aids-undetectable-virus-means-untransmittable-disease">transmitting the virus to others</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/20; SN: 11/15/19</em>). To date, only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-immune-system-elite-controllers">three people have beaten</a> an HIV infection <em>(SN: 8/26/20</em>). For most, it lasts a lifetime.</p>



<p>That long-lasting infection is just one reason why no vaccine against HIV exists yet. It’s also a tricky virus to pin down, with many variants and an uncanny ability to evade the immune system.</p>



<p>And money is an issue too. The lack of an effective HIV vaccine stands in stark contrast to COVID-19 vaccines that took <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data">less than a year to develop</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/20</em>). For COVID-19 vaccine development, “the money poured in, which was the right thing to do,” says Susan Zolla-Pazner, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Funding for HIV vaccine research comes in five-year installments, making it difficult to allocate the money in an efficient way to get a vaccine off the ground. Still, that funding stream has allowed for advances in HIV research, which partly enabled the rapid success of multiple COVID-19 vaccines.</p>



<p>The technology behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 jab</a>, for instance, was first developed as a strategy to tackle HIV because it triggers a strong immune response (<em>SN: 2/27/21</em>). The shot uses a common cold virus that has been altered so that it no longer causes disease. That carrier delivers instructions to cells to make the viral proteins needed to train the immune system to recognize the invader. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine uses a virus called adenovirus 26; the first HIV vaccine candidates used adenovirus 5.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, a clinical trial to test the HIV vaccine showed that participants who had already been naturally infected with adenovirus 5 were more likely to become infected with HIV. Researchers halted the trial. They speculated that those participants were more susceptible to HIV because they already had immunity to adenovirus 5 and that dampened HIV-protective responses from the vaccine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="a hand holding the handle of a small blue cooler with a red 'biohazard' sticker on it" class="wp-image-3100197" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060321_eg_hiv_inline1_rev.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100197">A pharmacist brings shots for the first participants in an HIV vaccine clinical trial called HVTN702 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in November 2016. The trial was halted in February 2020 after an interim analysis found that the vaccine was not effective at preventing HIV infection.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100197">Gallo Images/<em>The Times</em>/Jackie Clausen</span></figure>



<p>The absence of a good HIV vaccine is not for lack of trying, says Mark Feinberg, a viral immunologist who is president and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative in New York City. “The work that’s gone into HIV vaccine development has been by far the most sophisticated and creative.”</p>



<h3>Complexities of HIV</h3>



<p>Much of the difficulty in making a vaccine comes from the complex biology of the virus itself.</p>



<p>One major challenge is the immense genetic diversity among HIV viruses infecting people around the world. Much like the coronavirus, which has variants that are more transmissible or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">able to evade parts of the immune system</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>), HIV has variants too. But “it’s a completely different world for HIV,” says Morgane Rolland, a virologist with the Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md.  </p>



<p>That’s because the virus makes new copies of its genetic blueprint at a dizzyingly fast rate, generating tens of thousands of new copies every day in a single person, Rolland says. Each of those new copies carries on average at least one unique mutation. Over the course of years, a single person can carry myriad variants in their body, though only a select few variants can be transmitted to others. </p>



<p>The main problem these variants pose for vaccines is that some mutations are in parts of the virus that the immune system tends to attack. Such changes can essentially help the virus go incognito. Good vaccines must spark an immune response capable of handling that vast diversity to provide broad protection against infection.</p>



<p>What’s more, the virus deploys multiple tactics to hide from the immune system. One tactic the virus uses is to cover parts of its surface in a dense layer of sugar molecules. Many of those surfaces would be the prime targets of immune proteins called antibodies that latch onto viral particles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="an extremely magnified photo of the HIV virus" class="wp-image-3100198" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060321_eg_hiv_inline2.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100198">The complex biology of the human immunodeficiency virus (shown) has so far stymied efforts to design a vaccine effective at preventing infection with the virus. But researchers are developing creative solutions to tackle the problem.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100198">NIAID/Flickr (CC BY 2.0)</span></figure>



<p>The body recognizes these sugars as “self,” says Barton Haynes, an immunologist at Duke University School of Medicine’s Human Vaccine Institute. “Basically, what the virus is saying to our immune system is ‘Sure, you can make a protective immune response, go for it.’” But if the antibodies attack, they’re seen as turncoats and are eliminated. That means the body can’t fight the virus as effectively.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest hurdle, however, is the lifelong nature of the infection. Many viruses disappear from the body after the immune system fights them off. But HIV has the ability to insert its genetic blueprint into host DNA, establishing a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/inactive-hiv-poses-even-greater-barrier-cure">hidden reservoir</a> in immune cells called T cells, which normally fight infections (<em>SN: 10/24/13</em>). That reservoir makes the virus invisible to the immune system. Once the virus inhabits its new hideout, the immune system can’t eradicate it, nor can drug treatments.</p>



<p>That means “you’ve got to have protective immunity there the day, the moment of transmission,” Haynes says. “If [the immune system] doesn’t get rid of the virus within 24 hours, the virus has won.”</p>



<p>Most vaccines don’t generate this type of sterilizing immunity that stops the infection from ever happening in most people who get the vaccine. Instead, shots are more likely to prevent people from becoming severely ill. Many COVID-19 vaccines, for instance, are highly effective at preventing people from developing symptoms, particularly severe ones. But some vaccinated people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants">might still get infected</a> with the coronavirus (<em>SN: 5/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>That’s not an option with HIV since it never leaves the body, Zolla-Pazner says. “It’s a very different bar that we have to jump over for an HIV vaccine.”</p>



<h3>Testing HIV vaccine candidates</h3>



<p>To date, there have been only a handful of clinical trials to test the efficacy of potential HIV vaccines in people. Of the six trials that scientists saw to completion, only one vaccine candidate proved effective at preventing infection.</p>



<p>That lone successful trial, known as RV144, used a “prime-boost” strategy in which participants received a total of six shots. The four “prime” jabs contained a canarypox virus that is incapable of replicating in cells and carries the genetic instructions for select HIV proteins. The participants’ cells make those viral proteins and develop an immune response against them.</p>



<p>Then participants also received two “boosts,” an injection of an HIV protein fragment that is essential for the virus to enter cells. The hope was that participants would develop a strong, wide-ranging immune response, giving those people broad protection against a variety of HIV subtypes.</p>



<p>Ultimately, that vaccine strategy <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0908492">lowered the risk of infection by 31.2 percent in vaccinated participants</a> compared with the unvaccinated group. Although the shot showed only modest efficacy, those results changed the field by homing in on what type of immune response people needed to prevent infection, Zolla-Pazner says.</p>



<p>“Up until then, there was this raging debate about whether T cells or antibodies were most important in terms of protection,” Zolla-Pazner says. The results from RV144, first published in December 2009 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, suggested specific antibodies were the crucial factor in reducing the risk of infection. “That’s not to say that T cells are not important — they are. But I think it established the primacy of antibodies,” she notes. If researchers could push people to make protective HIV antibodies, then perhaps a vaccine was within reach.</p>



<p>More recently, however, the canarypox/protein strategy has produced some less-promising results. In February 2020 — as COVID-19 was spreading around the globe — researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-failed-key-clinical-trial-south-africa">stopped a follow-up trial being conducted in South Africa</a> that used the same vaccine platform with the goal of improving on the RV144 finding (<em>SN: 2/3/20</em>). The results from the trial <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031499">didn’t lower the risk of HIV infection in vaccinated people</a>, researchers reported March 25 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>This is where more money for HIV vaccine research could have helped, Zolla-Pazner says. “If you had the money up front and you use it as needed… [scientists] would be doing science more efficiently and therefore getting the answers more quickly.” That investment is especially crucial for early animal testing. Instead of spending decades testing approaches on a handful of animals at a time to see if something works, an influx of money could support more robust experiments. And that could speed promising approaches into the arms of clinical trial volunteers.  </p>



<h3>Making the right immune response</h3>



<p>There are now hopeful signs that vaccine developers working on a variety of platforms might be on the right track to make an effective shot that provides sterilizing immunity. Still, “I don’t think at this point we should be taking any approach off the table,” says Zolla-Pazner.</p>



<p>One approach is tapping into the idea that some infected people naturally make <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cows-produce-powerful-hiv-antibodies">antibodies capable of attacking a wide assortment of HIV variants</a> and stopping those viruses from infecting cells (<em>SN: 7/20/17</em>). These antibodies take a long time to develop. Sometimes they don’t develop until years after an HIV infection has taken hold, Haynes says. HIV vaccine-makers want to speed up the process.</p>



<p>There are several ways to do that. One, being tested now in a clinical trial led by Johnson &amp; Johnson, is to spark a <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-new-clinical-data-on-mosaic-based-hiv-preventive-vaccine-regimen">broad immune response using an HIV protein composed of a mosaic of different HIV strains</a> circulating around the world. Another way is to teach the immune system to make broadly neutralizing antibodies.</p>



<p>To do that, researchers identify broadly neutralizing antibodies in people infected with HIV. Then they can analyze the steps the body took to create those immune proteins. The goal is to craft a vaccine that tells vaccinated people to make similar antibodies when exposed to specific viral fragments, says Kevin Saunders, a vaccinologist at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.</p>



<p>In a December 2019 <em>Science </em>study, Saunders, Haynes and their colleagues showed that in vaccinated mice and rhesus macaques, they could spur the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6470/eaay7199">first steps of HIV antibodies that might eventually become broadly neutralizing</a>. A separate effort by Feinberg and his colleagues recently showed that <a href="https://www.iavi.org/news-resources/press-releases/2021/first-in-human-clinical-trial-confirms-novel-hiv-vaccine-approach-developed-by-iavi-and-scripps-research">97 percent of human participants in an early-stage clinical trial made those same rare immune cells</a> when exposed to a piece of HIV engineered to specifically generate the cells.</p>



<p>Other groups are focusing on T cells to fight infection. Louis Picker and Klaus Früh, for instance, developed <a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg1703?ijkey=e67d024547c970cf6f068c06690db14fb4dfff8c&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">a vaccine</a> that causes <a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg5413?ijkey=37784882f1d4c1c598168d6eacdedf98ff837c45&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">specialized T cells</a> to kill other T cells infected with HIV, rather than relying on antibodies to prevent infection entirely, the team reported in March in <em>Science Immunology</em>.</p>



<p>The team had previously shown that around half of monkeys given the vaccine were protected. The animals became infected with SIV — the primate equivalent of HIV — but the virus couldn’t replicate very well and over time the infection went away, says Picker, an immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. </p>



<p>The next step is to move the vaccine into people. “Whatever we see in the clinical trial, it’s breaking new ground,” says Früh, a viral immunologist also at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. “It’s the first time this has ever been done so we’re very excited about that.”   </p>



<p>After nearly four decades of trying, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. “I do believe we’ll get a vaccine, I really do,” Zolla-Pazner says. “But I don’t know how long that’s gonna take.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-museums-online-exhibits-education-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">How science museums reinvented themselves to survive the pandemic</a></h4>

<p>On January 30, 2020, Science Gallery Dublin assembled a small group of experts to discuss a strange new disease that had recently emerged in China. Four panelists talked about the origins of the new coronavirus, whether it might be airborne and the prospects for a vaccine. While they agreed that it was important to take the virus seriously, the speakers urged the audience not to panic. There had been no known cases in Ireland. The prospect of a local outbreak seemed remote.</p>



<p>“And that was the last live event we held in the gallery,” says Aisling Murray, the gallery’s head of programming. That very day, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)">public health emergency of international concern</a>.” Six weeks later, with cases on the rise all over the globe, Science Gallery Dublin shut its doors. It was a moment of reckoning. “What does Science Gallery mean when we don’t have a space?” Murray recalls wondering. “How do we continue to engage our audience?”</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic began to spiral out of control in March 2020, science museums around the world <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/shuttered-natural-history-museums-fight-survival-amid-covid-19-heartbreak">were forced to abruptly close</a>. In a matter of days, ticket revenue vanished. “It was an existential crisis,” says Christofer Nelson, president and CEO of the Association of Science and Technology Centers, or ASTC, in Washington, D.C. “The fundamental business, operational, staffing, community service model of these organizations just went away overnight. And the question was ‘What do we do next?’ ”</p>



<p>The weeks and months that followed were excruciatingly difficult for science museums, which lost more than $600 million <a href="https://www.astc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aggregate-Report-FINAL.pdf">in revenue</a> in just the first six months of the pandemic, the ASTC estimates. Many museums and science centers were forced to adopt deep cost-cutting measures; some laid off more than half of their employees.</p>





<p>Few science museums had substantial endowments to pull from, so they scrambled for support. They launched new campaigns for donations, applied for government loans and sought grants and support from community organizations or corporations.</p>



<p>As they tried to make ends meet, they also realized they had to reinvent their programs if they wanted to survive. Over the last year, they have launched a diverse array of exhibits and offerings that are not tied to their physical buildings, and they have helped educate the public about COVID-19. Some museums have even found creative ways to meet serious community needs, providing everything from child care to fresh food.</p>



<p>Along the way, these institutions have redefined what modern science museums can be and how they engage with the world beyond their walls. Though many museums are in various phases of reopening, their experience over the last year may leave a lasting legacy.</p>

<h4>Hasty pivot</h4>



<p>When museums initially closed last year, most administrators thought the disruption would last only a few months. In those early days and weeks, the institutions shifted into crisis response mode, scrambling to create some kind of public programming. “Within a couple of weeks, we were spinning up what now we would call ‘minimum viable products,’ ” says Tim Ritchie, president of the Museum of Science in Boston. Staff members who typically spent their days giving face-to-face presentations inside the museum on topics from reptiles to space started delivering those talks over Zoom. “It was not that great at first,” Ritchie admits. “But people were hungry [for it], and they tuned in.”</p>



<p>Many institutions did the same, making some of their traditional exhibits and programs virtual. By the end of March 2020, the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco had turned its program called NightLife — a regular Thursday night event that charged from $10 to $20 for admission to the museum for science, music and cocktails — into a free weekly online program called <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/nightlife">NightSchool</a>.</p>



<p>The Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland converted its in-person demos into Curiosity Corner LIVE! This daily YouTube broadcast included science demonstrations and activities — such as building catapults and lava lamps — for kids and families to do at home.</p>



<p>Seattle’s Pacific Science Center <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSh2l8jOpghaEvk6Rxf_p2-2cW3pY3dj_">filmed the live science shows</a> that it typically staged in person and shot a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSh2l8jOpghbM79BmwGAzrRuvTVo3sSQP">behind-the-scenes videos</a>, featuring Senora the tarantula, Rigatoni the western hognose snake and other animals in its collection. “We recorded everything that we could, as quickly as we could,” says Zeta Strickland, the center’s director of preK–12 engagement. The center’s most popular live science show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrOM4h1BxM&amp;list=PLSh2l8jOpghaEvk6Rxf_p2-2cW3pY3dj_&amp;index=1">Combustion</a>, has had more than 6,500 views on YouTube.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="a screen capture from a video about Combustion" class="wp-image-3100066" height="554" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-1_pacific-science.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100066">Early in the pandemic, many science museums scrambled to convert their in-person demonstrations into online videos.

<p>Museums also used their science communication expertise to address the pandemic itself. There was an “immediate and urgent recognition that this crisis was fundamentally a crisis of science engagement,” says the ASTC’s Nelson.</p>



<p>Shannon Bennett, a virologist who happens to be the California Academy of Science’s chief of science, <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/a-message-to-our-academy-community-on-covid-19">fielded online questions about COVID-19</a>, while the Pacific Science Center designed an online <a href="https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/events-programs/understanding-covid19/">landing page for pandemic-related information</a>. The page includes a pandemic glossary, a vaccine explainer and a guide to identifying misinformation. The website also offers a curated collection of news articles and links to trusted sources, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There was so much misinformation and disinformation out there, so we really wanted to be a resource where people can find accurate information,” says Danielle Cobb, marketing communications manager for the Pacific Science Center.</p>



<p>Some museums stepped up to meet more basic community needs. The Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., had started running a weekly summer farmers market in its pavilion in 2017. When the pandemic hit, local schools, which offer free breakfast and lunch to all students, shut down. “There was a huge focus on how do you get food to kids that they would otherwise get through the school,” says Lara Litchfield-Kimber, the museum’s executive director. “What we realized is that in our city, we had an essential business.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="a photo of people at a farmer's market, everyone is wearing face masks" class="wp-image-3100065" height="787" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-8_farmers-market-midhudson.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100065">When the Poughkeepsie, N.Y., area shut down in spring 2020, the Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum saw food insecurity grow. The museum already ran a summer farmers market, but extended the season to May through October.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100065">Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum</span></figure></div>



<p>The museum rallied its vendors and opened the market, which accepts food stamps, in May, a month before its typical start. The market became a hub of activity, and museum staff worked with city officials to distribute flyers, in English and in Spanish, about COVID-19. (The museum is exploring the possibility of hosting a year-round market.) “The museums that are … maintaining their strength are those that recognize how to leverage their assets to address the urgent needs of their community,” Litchfield-Kimber says.</p>



<p>On the other side of the country, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXiHhHYMmw">offering child care</a> for 20 to 30 children of essential workers. “We have the training. We have the certifications. We have the people. We have the stuff to have kids in the museum — that’s just what we do,” says John Farmer, the museum’s former marketing and communications manager.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="a photo of a man holding a crested gecko up to the viewer" class="wp-image-3100067" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-2_oregon.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100067">Educator Brad Alston of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry offers online viewers a closer look at Bebe the crested gecko.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100067">OREGON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY</span></figure></div>



<p>In the fall, the museum converted the child care program into Homeroom, offering a place where children who were enrolled in remote school could spend their days. The museum prioritized families in need, Farmer says, and offered financial aid for the program, which has enrolled more than 100 students over the last year. San Diego’s Fleet Science Center organized similar <a href="https://www.fleetscience.org/press-room/fleet-science-center-helps-bridge-gap-between-home-and-classroom-learning-distance">distance learning hubs</a> so children could go to the center and connect to their remote classrooms.</p>



<p>Many museums also put together resources for schools that had shifted to remote teaching. The California Academy of Sciences <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/educators/science-films-for-the-classroom">reformatted its planetarium films for YouTube</a> so teachers could show films like <em>Expedition Reef</em> and <em>Fragile Planet </em>to their students. The center also offers <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/educators/field-trips/distance-learning">free distance learning livestreams</a>, in English and in Spanish, for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.</p>



<p>The New York Hall of Science in Queens began offering virtual science workshops to schools: A museum educator leads an entire class of kids through an hour of activities and demonstrations on topics ranging from optical illusions to the science of sports. The workshops, which cost $150 for a group, sell out months in advance. “What teachers want is a bit of relief,” says Margaret Honey, president and CEO of the New York Hall of Science. “They really gravitate toward the experiences.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="a screen capture of a virtual exhibit by the Museum of Science in Boston" class="wp-image-3100068" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-3_boston.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100068">Many science museums addressed the COVID-19 pandemic head on.

<h4>Pushing the envelope</h4>



<p>As the pandemic dragged on, museums started to think longer term. They got more ambitious and creative. “We decided to get better at being digital,” Ritchie says.</p>



<p>Last summer, Boston’s Museum of Science created <a href="https://virtualexhibits.mos.org/covid-conversations/">Ask a Virtual Expert</a>, an experience powered by artificial intelligence featuring Ashish Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University in Providence, R.I. Museum staff filmed Jha as he answered more than 500 questions on COVID-19 and then turned the footage into an interactive exhibit. Members of the public can pose questions about the pandemic directly to a digital version of Jha, and he responds.</p>



<p>The Smithsonian, which began 3-D scanning some of its artifacts years ago, used the time that its doors were closed to improve its <a href="https://3d.si.edu/">digital 3-D offerings</a>. On its website, for instance, visitors can peruse or download free, 3-D scans of everything from the Apollo 11 command module to a complete woolly mammoth skeleton. In December, the institution announced <a href="https://dpo.si.edu/blog/do-it-for-the-gram">a partnership with Instagram</a> that allows users of the photo sharing app to display virtual versions of famous Smithsonian artifacts in their own personal spaces. “You can drop the space shuttle <em>Discovery</em> in your backyard and have your family standing next to it and have a screenshot and share it on Twitter,” says Vincent Rossi, supervisor of the 3-D program for the Smithsonian’s Digitization Program Office.</p>

</div></div>



<p>Other museums found clever ways to create in-person experiences that were COVID-19 safe. Science Gallery Dublin, located on the campus of Trinity College Dublin, took advantage of the glass facade on one side of its building, installing five pandemic-related exhibits just inside the glass. Passersby could peer into the windows and see a cluster of Lego figures arranged to demonstrate the concept of herd immunity or a sensor-laden, 3-D printed dress with a skirt that spreads out to enforce social distancing.</p>



<p>Called “<a href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/sos">Speed of Science</a>,” the exhibition was produced in partnership with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which had collaborated with the gallery on a <a href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/waas">pop-up exhibit in 2019</a>. The exhibit’s online hub, which includes a podcast on vaccination and vaccine development, has had nearly 5,000 visits.</p>



<p>Last summer, Space Center Houston offered <a href="https://spacecenter.org/new-summer-clean-room-camps/">“clean room” camps</a>, which simulated the experience of working in one of the NASA facilities dedicated to ensuring that the objects the agency launches into space are free of potential contaminants. Upon arrival at camp, kids donned gowns, gloves, masks, caps and shoe coverings. “Basically, we shrink-wrap the kids,” says William Harris, the center’s president and CEO. “It’s just like they’re in a clean room at NASA.” The camps were so popular that the center offered them again over the Thanksgiving, winter and spring breaks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="kids wearing protective gear in a cleanroom" class="wp-image-3100070" height="1030" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-5_houston.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100070">Kids who attended Space Center Houston’s clean room camps wore personal protective equipment to simulate the experience of working in a NASA clean room.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100070">SPACE CENTER HOUSTON</span></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum used its closure in 2020 to begin a long-planned transition to becoming a more hands-on science center. To jump-start its science programming while the building was closed, the museum bought a van and partnered with NASA to turn it into a mobile, pop-up museum for outdoor, space-related demonstrations and activities.</p>



<h4>Expanded reach</h4>



<p>As difficult as the pandemic has been, it’s also given science museums an opportunity to make long-needed changes and pursue long-standing goals. Even before COVID-19 emerged, the Center of Science and Industry, or COSI, in Columbus, Ohio, had been wanting to find new ways to get out into the community. “Yes, we want to sell tickets to our building,” says Frederic Bertley, COSI’s president and CEO. “But we have to be more than that.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img alt="a kid wearing a purple shirt working on a science project" class="wp-image-3100064" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-7_cosi-midhudson-450x450.jpg" width="450" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100064">Children tested a project last summer that the Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum will offer through a new pop-up mobile program.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100064">Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum</span></figure></div>



<p>When COSI closed in March 2020, its staff rolled out <a href="https://cosi.org/connects/">an assortment of digital offerings</a> — and <a href="https://cosi.org/zoo/item/qed-with-dr-b">launched a TV show</a> — but the team also wanted to re-create the hands-on, tactile experiences that have long been the cornerstone of science museums. The solution was an assortment of <a href="https://cosi.org/connects/kits/">COSI Connects kits</a>.</p>



<p>Each kit has five hands-on activities for kids that revolve around a theme: nature, water, space, dinosaurs or the human body. The kits can be purchased online, and COSI distributes them for free through food banks, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, homeless shelters and other organizations. The museum is in discussions to distribute them through school districts in Ohio and several other states.</p>



<p>“We weren’t trying to make money off of this,” Bertley says. “We were trying to make sure that COSI was still relevant, that a state-of-the-art science museum still had a fundamental role in society, even though we were closed.” COSI plans to continue offering the kits when the building reopens in early June. “This is how we can have a beyond-Ohio impact,” Bertley says.</p>



<p>Indeed, museums are discovering that untethering their programs from their physical buildings has expanded their reach. At the California Academy of Sciences, a pre-pandemic, in-person NightLife event typically attracted roughly 1,700 people. NightSchool, the virtual version, averages more than 10,000 views per installment. These events are free; they don’t bring in money. But, says senior digital engagement and community manager Laurel Allen, “we’ve been able to build bigger communities.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="a photo of a science kit" class="wp-image-3100063" height="514" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_museums_inline-6_cosi-kit.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100063">The Center of Science and Industry has been distributing kits of hands-on science activities through local food banks and homeless shelters.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100063">KEVIN MICHAEL SEYMOUR PHOTOGRAPHY</span></figure></div>



<p>Although the academy initially thought of its online events as a stopgap measure, it has decided to continue them in some form now that the museum has reopened. The majority of viewers are outside the Bay Area and are unlikely to make regular in-person visits.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/3d-virtual-tour">An immersive virtual tour</a> created by the National Museum of Computing in Milton Keynes, England, last summer has attracted more than 140,000 visitors from the United Kingdom, United States, India and Brazil. “I don’t think we ever took for granted the audience reach that we had,” says Jacqui Garrad, the museum’s director. “But I do think that we maybe didn’t try hard enough to engage some of the outside communities.”</p>



<p>Some museums have invested in accessibility, overhauling websites to be more friendly to visitors who are blind or have low vision and offering digital programs specifically for visitors who are deaf and hard of hearing. Others have increased their free offerings and resources for low-income families and other underserved communities. The Museum of Science in Boston launched <a href="https://www.mos.org/explore/mos-en-espanol">MOS en Español</a>, an online hub for programming in Spanish.</p>



<p>Of course, the pandemic — and the threat to museums’ basic business model — is not over yet. “I don’t think we’re by any means out of the woods,” ASTC’s Nelson says. Museums were “great at cutting costs,” he adds. “But they’re now at the bare minimum.”</p>



<p>In a June 2020 survey of 750 museum directors, <a href="https://www.aam-us.org/2020/07/22/united-states-may-lose-one-third-of-all-museums-new-survey-shows/">one-third reported</a> that their institutions were at “significant risk” of closing permanently. So far, the ASTC is aware of just one permanent closure among science museums: the Orpheum Children’s Science Museum in Champaign, Ill. And while some museums have reopened, visitors have been slow to return; attendance is about half pre-pandemic levels, according to ASTC’s ongoing attendance survey.</p>



<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://www.astc.org/coronavirus/advocacy/">ASTC lobbied the federal government</a> to include museums in relief efforts and pulled together online resources to help its members navigate new financial and operational realities. In the first round of the federal Paycheck Protection Program, nearly 300 of ASTC’s members received loans totaling more than $180 million.</p>



<p>When museums close, it’s a huge loss for their communities, Nelson says. “Museums really serve as a critical part of their communities’ economic, cultural and learning ecosystems.”</p>



<p>But the museums that survive may emerge more nimble and resilient — and able to serve the public in new and urgent ways. “We need to double down on this idea of wanting to respond at all times to what the community needs,” says Steven Snyder, president and CEO of San Diego’s Fleet Science Center. “It’s also a proof of concept that we’re not locked to our building. Science centers never have been.”</p>

Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-die-off-mystery-fossils-pacific-ocean-paleontology">Something mysteriously wiped out about 90 percent of sharks 19 million years ago</a></h4>

<p>About 19 million years ago, something terrible happened to sharks.</p>



<p>Fossils gleaned from sediments in the Pacific Ocean reveal a previously unknown and dramatic shark extinction event, during which <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz3549">populations of the predators abruptly dropped by up to 90 percent</a>, researchers report in the June 4 <em>Science</em>. And scientists don’t know what might have caused the die-off.</p>



<p>“It’s a great mystery,” says Elizabeth Sibert, a paleobiologist and oceanographer at Yale University. “Sharks have been around for 400 million years. They’ve been through hell and back. And yet this event wiped out [up to] 90 percent of them.”</p>



<p>Sharks suffered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">losses of 30 to 40 percent</a> in the aftermath of the asteroid strike that killed off all nonbird dinosaurs 66 million years ago (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>). But after that, sharks enjoyed about 45 million years of peaceful ocean dominance, sailing through even large climate disruptions such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rate-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-rise-unprecedented">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a> — an episode about 56 million years ago marked by a sudden spike in global carbon dioxide and soaring temperatures — without much trouble (<em>SN: 5/7/15</em>).</p>





<p>Now, clues found in the fine red clay sediments beneath two vast regions of Pacific add a new, surprising chapter to sharks’ story.</p>



<p>Sibert and Leah Rubin, then an undergraduate student at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, sifted through fish teeth and shark scales buried in sediment cores collected during previous research expeditions to the North and South Pacific oceans.</p>



<p>“The project came out of a desire to better understand the natural background variability of these fossils,” Sibert says. Sharks’ bodies are made of mostly cartilage, which doesn’t tend to fossilize. But their skin is covered in tiny scales, or dermal denticles, each about the width of a human hair follicle. These scales make for an excellent record of past shark abundance: Like shark teeth, the scales are made of the mineral bioapatite, which is readily preserved in sediments. “And we will find several hundred more denticles compared to a tooth,” Sibert says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="fossilized shark scales on a black background" class="wp-image-3100179" height="355" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060221_CG_shark_dieoff_inline-680.png" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100179">Researchers sorted fossil shark scales, or denticles, into two main types: those with linear striations (left) and those with geometric shapes and with no striations (right). Following the shark extinction event 19 million years ago, the geometric denticles all but disappeared from ocean sediments.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100179">E.C. Sibert and L.D. Rubin/<em>Science</em> 2021</span></figure>



<p>The researchers weren’t expecting to see anything particularly startling. From 66 million years ago to about 19 million years ago, the ratio of fish teeth to shark scales in the sediments held steady at about 5 to 1. But abruptly — the team estimates within 100,000 years, and possibly even faster — that ratio dramatically changed, to 100 fish teeth for every 1 shark scale.</p>



<p>The sudden disappearance of shark scales coincided with a change in the abundances of shark scale shapes, which give some clues to changes in biodiversity. Most modern sharks have linear striations on their scales, which may offer some boost to their swimming efficiency. But some sharks lack these striations; instead, the scales come in a variety of geometric shapes. By analyzing the change in the different shapes’ abundances before and after 19 million years ago, the researchers estimated a loss of shark biodiversity of between 70 and 90 percent. The extinction event was “selective,” says Rubin, now a marine scientist at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. After the event, the geometric scales “were almost gone, and never really showed up again in the diversity that they [previously] did.”</p>



<p>There’s no obvious climate event that might explain such a massive shark population shift, Sibert says. “Nineteen million years ago is not known as a formative time in Earth’s history.” Solving the mystery of the die-off is at the top of a long list of questions she hopes to answer. Other questions include better understanding how the different denticles might relate to shark lineages, and what impact the sudden loss of so many big predators might have had on other ocean dwellers.</p>





<p>It’s <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj2088">a question with modern implications</a>, as paleobiologist Catalina Pimiento of the University of Zurich and paleobiologist Nicholas Pyenson of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., write in a commentary in the same issue of Science. In just the last 50 years, shark abundances in the oceans have dramatically declined by more than 70 percent as a result of overfishing and ocean warming. The loss of sharks — and other top marine predators, such as whales — from the oceans has “profound, complex and irreversible ecological consequences,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Indeed, one way to view the study is as a cautionary tale about modern conservation’s limits, says marine conservation biologist Catherine Macdonald of the University of Miami, who was not involved with this study. “Our power to act to protect what remains does not include an ability to fully reverse or undo the effects of the massive environmental changes we have already made.”</p>



<p>Populations of top ocean predators can be important indicators of those changes — and unraveling how the ocean ecosystem responded to their loss in the past could help researchers anticipate what may happen in the near future, Sibert says. “The sharks are trying to tell us something,” she adds, “and I can’t wait to find out what it is.”</p>

<p><strong>Information outflow</strong> – <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavioral-sciences-79"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 5, 1971</p>



<p>The United States’ population is growing at a rate of one percent a year, and even with lower fertility rates this trend will probably continue. If the fertility rate dropped to 2.1 children per woman, the population of the country would level off in the year 2037 at 267 million. But, this would require an unlikely 50 percent decrease in the birth rate.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Those projections, based on 1970 census data, recently veered off course. As of April 2020, about 331.5 million people lived in the United States, according to census data. But from July  2019 to July 2020, the population grew by just 0.35 percent — the lowest annual growth rate in over a century. For most of the last 50 years, the population grew by about 1 percent per year, thanks in large part to immigration. While the fertility rate dropped below 2.1 children per woman after 1971 and the birth rate declined by 29 percent from 1970 to 2014,<a> </a><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2015/09/28/chapter-5-u-s-foreign-born-population-trends/">the foreign-born population quadrupled</a> from just under 10 million people to over 40 million. Over the last several years, though, immigration has slowed and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/us-life-expectancy-drops-second-year">life expectancy has decreased</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/17</em>). In 2020, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr012-508.pdf">fertility rate dropped to a record low</a> of 1.64 children per woman and the birth rate — at 56 births per 1,000 women — became the lowest on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.</p>
<p>Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?</strong><br />
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.</p>
<p>Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.</p>
<p>In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>How can publishers advance public engagement?</strong><br />
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable <strong>“Patients perspectives”</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors <strong>to write a lay summary</strong> of their work (in one or more languages), <strong>a patient information note</strong>, and/or <strong>depict an infographic</strong> to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.</p>
<p>Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating <strong>the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist</strong>. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.</p>

<p><strong>The new normal</strong><br />
Innovations like creating and training<strong> a pool of engaged patient reviewers</strong> to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the <a href="https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/">Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/">Arthritis Foundation</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> the results of <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3">a systematic review</a> and <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0">a global survey</a> analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.</p>

<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/">Brian Simulator</a> is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</p>

When the University of Colorado at Denver completed an investigation in 2015 into the work of a former faculty member, the school recommended that nine papers be corrected or retracted. But six years after the close of that investigation, the researcher, urologist Hari Koul, has had just two papers retracted and one corrected.  Multiple journal … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/03/exclusive-six-years-after-a-misconduct-investigation-more-than-half-of-suspect-papers-remain-unflagged/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Exclusive: Six years after a misconduct investigation, more than half of suspect papers remain unflagged</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/06/03/e-cigarettes-and-smoking-among-teenagers/">E-cigarettes and smoking among teenagers</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published <em>Tobacco Free Ireland</em>, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1">Our systematic review</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.</p>
<blockquote><p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes</p></blockquote>
<p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.</p>

<br /><p>Join us for a <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org">OCNS</a>) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021">here</a>.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.</p>
<p>The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.</p>
<p>To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/">https://labs.fedoraproject.org/</a> .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>While some vegetarians yearn for meat (and occasionally give into temptation), others who eschew animal products find meat repulsive. Those who go veggie for moral reasons — as opposed to those who do it for their health — are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00685.x">particularly likely</a> to find meat disgusting, even if they previously enjoyed its taste.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!">new study</a> from a University of Exeter team, it isn’t just vegetarians who find the look of meat disgusting, either — sometimes, meat-eaters do too. And in a world where many of us are being encouraged to give up meat for the sake of the environment, the researchers suggest that harnessing this disgust could be a way of reducing intake when other techniques fail.</p>



<span id="more-42446"></span>



<p>The 711 participants in the study were a mix of people with different diets — 56% identified as omnivores, 28% as flexitarians (i.e. those who are sometimes vegetarian and sometimes omnivorous), and 15% vegetarians, some of whom were vegan and some pescatarian.</p>



<p>First, an implicit association task (IAT) measured implicit attitudes towards meat. Participants were presented with a series of images of foods, which they had to classify as meat or carbs, and words like “foul” or “mouth-watering”, which they had to classify as “delicious” or “disgusting”. The participants sorted both images and words into categories using left and right keys on their keyboard: for example, on one side they might see “carbs OR disgusting” and on the other “meat OR delicious” (in other trials, “meat” was paired with “disgusting” instead). If you find meat delicious, then responding should be faster when “meat” and “delicious” share the same key, the logic goes (though the IAT itself has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">faced controversy</a>).    </p>



<p>Next, the team looked at <em>explicit</em> responses to meat. The same pictures of meat and carbs were used, with participants asked to rate the images on a scale from 0 to 100 according to taste, how likely they would be to eat the food, and feelings of disgust. Finally, the team measured self-control, how much meat participants ate, and how long they had followed their particular diet. A follow-up survey, six months later, repeated these measures.</p>



<p>Vegetarians exhibited the highest level of disgust in both the explicit and implicit tests, with flexitarians second highest above omnivores. Carbs, on the other hand, were liked equally across all groups.</p>



<p>Vegetarians don’t like meat: it’s hardly breaking news. But what <em>was</em> interesting about the results was the relationship between meat disgust and intake in the other two groups. In both the omnivore and flexitarian sample those who felt higher explicit meat disgust also had lower meat intake.</p>



<p>The follow-up study provided further evidence that disgust has a tangible impact on how people eat. Flexitarians who showed an increase in their levels of explicit disgust of meat over the six month period had also decreased their meat intake by the time of the second survey.</p>



<p>Encouraging disgust of meat could, therefore, be a way of encouraging people to cut down on meat. The team points to previous <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.766">research</a> that suggests many omnivores simply repress feelings of disgust around eating sentient, emotional creatures: harnessing this knowledge and increasing disgust could be one way of persuading someone that life is better vegetarian. However, it may not be a foolproof strategy — at present, it’s not clear in which direction the effect is working. Is disgust causing people to cut down on meat, or is cutting down on meat increasing disgust? Further research could look more closely at the direction of cause-and-effect.</p>

<p>Last March, I shared <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/">my concerns</a> about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996">a paper </a>from the <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/">IHU-Méditerranée Infection</a> (IHUMI)/ <a href="https://www.univ-amu.fr/en">Aix-Marseille University</a> (AMU) claiming that Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin could reduce coronavirus viral loads faster than no treatment. </p>



<p>Other papers by this group of researchers led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand man Professor Eric Chabrière, also appear to contain problems, ranging from potentially duplicated images to ethical concerns. </p>



<p>In this blog post I have gathered the papers by the Raoult and Chabrière group that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a compilation of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors removing any concerns by providing the original figures.</p>



<span id="more-2587"></span>



<h3>Concerns about duplicated images</h3>



<p>A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors have not replied to most of these PubPeer posts, nor have they corrected the errors.</p>



<h3>Category I duplications</h3>



<p>Some papers, such as DOI: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/">10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED">PubPeer</a>] or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/">10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A"> </a>[<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A">PubPeer</a>] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/">a previous post</a>, I call these <strong>Category I duplications</strong>, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. These kinds of simple duplications can often be honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum. Unfortunately, the authors have not replied to most of the PubPeer posts.</p>

<h3>Category II duplications</h3>



<p>Two papers in this set contain <strong>Category II duplications</strong>, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. </p>



<p>DOI <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/">10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1">PubPeer</a>] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which would be unexpected if the errors were unintentional. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction. The authors wrote: “<em>These resulted from errors by a researcher that were missed by other authors. Specifically, a single image was inappropriately inserted to represent three different experiments.</em>“</p>

<p>As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> docs or you browse <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill</a>, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.</p>

Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex">pycortex library</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?</p>



<p>A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Technology</th><th>Application areas</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th><th>What you learn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Python-based generators</td><td>Dashboards, lightweight interactions</td><td>Easy distribution, low barrier to entry</td><td>Limited interactivity</td><td>Grammar of interactive graphics</td></tr><tr><td>Jupyter notebook</td><td>Daily data exploration</td><td>You’re already using it!</td><td>Distribution not straightforward</td><td>Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG</td></tr><tr><td>Walled garden</td><td>All-in-one visualizations (widgets)</td><td>Limited things to learn</td><td>What you learn is non-transferable</td><td>The walled garden</td></tr><tr><td>JS notebooks</td><td>Literate programs</td><td>REPL environment, good docs</td><td>Learning curve a bit steep</td><td>Core JS plus visualization libraries</td></tr><tr><td>The web</td><td>Web dataviz</td><td>You control everything</td><td>Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep</td><td>Packaging, components, deployment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2>Step 0: Python-based generators</h2>



<p>Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging Python-based generators. Some tools offer limited interactivity while staying entirely in Python. These tools have <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617">seen explosive growth in the past few years</a>. Overall, these solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations.</p>



<h3>Streamlit</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7657" data-attachment-id="7657" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png" data-orig-size="838,742" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-2-4/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300" /></a><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/">A demo visualization in streamlit</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> serves plots and dashboards from Python. A script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, and the whole thing is served in the cloud. The streamlit server does its own caching to minimize requests. Every request has some lag but the solution has surprisingly good performance. Some custom visualizations can be written in JS via a component API. Cons: does lightweight interactivity well – sliders, combo boxes – but not meant for anything too interactive. Limited by the set of components offered by default. <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery">Sample visualizations here</a>.</p>



<h3>Dash</h3>



<p>Similar to Streamlit, but <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">focused on the plotly ecosystem</a>. Dash is targeted more towards at enterprise users. <a href="https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/">Sample visualizations here</a>.</p>



<h3>Panel</h3>



<p>Similar to streamlit and dash, <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">focused on the holoviews ecosystem</a>.</p>



<h3>Plotting and mapping libraries</h3>



<p>Some Python plotting and mapping libraries offer minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc.. This includes <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>, <a href="http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html">Bokeh w/Holoviews</a> and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html">Altair w/vegalite</a>. On the mapping side, <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet">ipyleaflet</a> is worth mentioning. </p>



<h2>Step 1: build for jupyter notebook</h2>



<p>Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser <em>right now</em>, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.</p>



<h3>_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="Image" height="126" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="417" />Basic demo of _repr_html_</figure></div>



<p>When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a <code>_repr_html_</code> method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing">See this colab for examples on how to do this</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669">You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method</a>, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. </p>



<p>You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output">using the ipython API</a>. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;'))
</pre></div>


<h3>ipywidgets and interact</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>ipywidgets</strong>, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb">interactive HTML widgets</a> for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.</p><cite><a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">The ipywidget manual</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Next in line in complexity are <code>ipywidgets</code>. Like <code>IPython.core.display</code>, <code>ipywidgets</code> can display rich HTML; however, <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html">widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python</a>. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5">See this notebook for an example</a>. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called <code>interact</code> which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.</p>



<h3>voila</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif" /><a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">Voila example, from their docs</a>.</figure>



<p>Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called <a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">voila</a>. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Walled gardens</h2>



<p>At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing <em>real javascript</em> in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.</p>

<p><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">difficult to interact with the native DOM</a>. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.</p>



<h3>p5.js and openprocessing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><br /><br />OpenProcessing sketch, <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689">Self-organized critical model</a></figure>



<p><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://openprocessing.org/">openprocessing</a> bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Javascript notebooks</h2>



<p>The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. </p>



<p>For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.</p>



<h3>Observable</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7664" data-attachment-id="7664" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png" data-orig-size="603,602" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/" height="572" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" width="573" /></a>Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example">Code here</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  <a href="https://observablehq.com/tutorials">It has an excellent set of starter tutorials</a>. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript">it does not use Javascript</a>, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.</p>



<h3>Starboard</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7671" data-attachment-id="7671" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coupled-oscillators" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif" data-orig-size="380,380" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" /></a>An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. <a href="https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a">Source</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://starboard.gg/">Starboard</a> is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” </p><cite>Pyodide docs</cite></blockquote>



<p>That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary – though you’ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like <a href="https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite">jupyterlite</a> are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.</p>



<h2>Step 4: the web</h2>



<p>Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>, might satisfy your needs. </p>



<p>One very annoying gotcha you’ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you’ll use for data analysis in JS – like mathjs – were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you’ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack</a> and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));</code></pre>



<p>Thanks to Guido Zuidhof <a href="https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42">for patiently explaining this to me</a>. For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">flask</a> deployed on <a href="https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku">heroku</a> would do the trick.</p>



<h2>JS libraries</h2>



<p>As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:</p>



<ul><li>d3: data driven documents in JS, <a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a></li><li>mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: <a href="https://mathjs.org/">https://mathjs.org/</a></li><li>stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib</a></li><li>Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/</a></li><li>Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">https://www.tensorflow.org/js</a></li><li>Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: <a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a></li><li>Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: <a href="https://github.com/uwdata/arquero">https://github.com/uwdata/arquero</a></li></ul>



<p>I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">arXiv’s membership program is now based on submissions</a></h4>

<p>arXiv’s members have provided approximately 25% of our operating budget for the past ten years, supporting arXiv’s mission to provide a reliable open platform for sharing research. By becoming arXiv members, more than 230 institutions around the world have made a strong statement in favor of open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing. Thank you, members!</p>
<p>We are happy to announce our <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">updated membership program</a>, which was developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Membership Advisory Board</a>. This program is part of our<a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/05/26/arxiv-sustainability-model/"> sustainability model</a>, complements arXiv’s diverse <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">funding sources, including societies and other organizations, </a>and ensures that arXiv will have the funding required to continue meeting researchers’ evolving needs.</p>
<p>arXiv membership is inclusive, flexible, and offers your institution a high value, low-risk, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community. Members receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics, eligibility to serve in arXiv’s governance, and more.</p>
<h1><strong>How it works</strong></h1>
<p>Universities, libraries, research institutes, and laboratories are invited to join or renew. For standard memberships, annual fees are based on submissions by institution, averaged over three years.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions">find your institution’s overall submission rank here,</a> as shown in the screenshot.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1003" style="width: 836px;"><img alt="screenshot of interface to find submissions by institution" class="wp-image-1003 size-full" height="377" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Find-submissions-by-institution-1.png" width="836" />Hover your cursor over the area indicated by the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, match the overall rank to one of the contribution levels here:</p>
<p><img alt="If an institution ranks in the top 100 submitting institutions, their fee is $5000. Institutions ranked between 101 and 500 are charged $2500. Institutions ranked above 500 are charged $1000." class="size-full wp-image-1004 aligncenter" height="182" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Member-Levels-2021-05-26-at-11.08.59-AM.png" width="409" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The top 100 institutions submitting articles to arXiv are invited to become members at the $5,000 level. The fee for institutions ranked between 101 and 500 is $2,500, and the fee for institutions ranked above 501 is $1,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Institutions that join or renew now will lock in their membership fee for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Institutions joining as part of a consortium will receive a 10% discount. Country-level consortia will receive a higher discount, depending on the level of participation.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Example</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the example below, the university’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions">overall submission rank</a> is 182, which corresponds to the $2500 standard membership fee.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1008" style="width: 746px;"><img alt="Example submission data" class="wp-image-1008 size-full" height="149" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Submissions-example.png" width="746" />The overall rank, which is the three year submission average, is indicated by the purple arrow.</figure>
<p> </p>
<h2>Two flexible alternatives<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the <strong>Champion</strong> membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year">primarily for reading</a> or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, <strong>Community</strong> membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/arxiv-sustainability-model/">Announcing arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a></h4>

<p>In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a>. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors — and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.</p>
<p>For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise — and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:</p>
<p><b>Members </b></p>
<p>Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes</a> across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance. <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">Learn more about updates to the membership program here.</a></p>
<p><b>Affiliates</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits </a>collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become an affiliate or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sponsors</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Companies</a> that benefit from arXiv’s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become a sponsor or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">submissions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads">downloads</a></li>
<li>seamless interoperability with other platforms</li>
<li>increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information</li>
<li>modernization of backend services and technological infrastructure for improved stability, performance and innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you already support arXiv, thank you! If not, we encourage you to consider how you or your organization can get involved. You’re invited to <a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org">contact us</a> to start the conversation.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Loneliness can be something of a vicious cycle. As <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/">previous research</a> has suggested, your personality can increase your likelihood of being lonely, and loneliness can impact your personality. We also know that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/25/ten-year-study-finds-loneliness-and-self-centeredness-appear-to-be-mutually-reinforcing/">self-centredness</a> can increase loneliness, that being <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/16/being-true-to-yourself-may-protect-against-the-harmful-effects-of-loneliness/">true to yourself</a> can reduce loneliness, and that even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">warming yourself up on a cold day</a> can ease cravings for social contact.</p>



<p>Loneliness, then, is highly dependent on personality factors as well as social factors such as discrimination, limited access to transport, and lack of social cohesion. And a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, identifies another individual factor: low self-control. According to Olga Stavrova and team from Tilburg University in the Netherlands, failures of self-control can have serious social ramifications — leading to ostracism and, eventually, loneliness.</p>



<span id="more-42440"></span>



<p>The first study used data from 2,710 participants taking part in a longitudinal survey in the Netherlands. The team looked specifically at one time point in the study, where participants had answered questions on self-control, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am good at resisting temptation”, and loneliness, responding to statements such as “I have a sense of emptiness around me”.</p>



<p>The researchers also examined participants’ Big Five personality traits, as well as demographic variables that have been previously associated with loneliness — gender, age, whether or not the participant lived alone or with partners or children, education, employment status, and income.</p>



<p>The results showed that lower self-control predicts higher loneliness, an effect similar in size to that of some other predictors of loneliness such as low levels of extraversion and agreeableness (however, low emotional stability was a much stronger predictor than low self-control).</p>



<p>A second study looked at day-to-day feelings of loneliness. Participants took part in a daily diary exercise, writing every day for a week about how lonely they had felt, and how often they had given in to a temptation. They also completed a measure of “trait” levels of self-control to measure base levels.</p>



<p>Again, those with lower trait self-control were more likely to experience loneliness. Furthermore, those who reported failures in self-control on one day were also more likely to report loneliness in their diary on the subsequent day.</p>



<p>Why might lower self-control lead to loneliness? The researchers wondered whether low self-control signals that someone is not trustworthy, and so makes them more likely to be ostracised by others. So in another study, they asked participants to read a short paragraph about Robin, a (fabricated) previous participant who was having problems saving money but who nonetheless had ended up in an expensive electronics shop. In the low self-control condition, participants read that Robin had bought himself a new smartphone — even though he didn’t need one — while the high self-control condition heard that Robin had resisted temptation and left the shop empty-handed.</p>



<p>They were then asked to imagine that Robin was a new co-worker and to indicate how likely they were to exclude him, and whether they thought he was likely to care for or take time for others, or engage in behaviours that could hurt others.</p>



<p>Consistent with their predictions, the team found that participants in the low self-control condition were more likely to ostracise Robin, which could partly be explained by the fact that they also perceived him as less prosocial and more likely to engage in selfish, potentially harmful behaviour. A final study found that participants with low self-control themselves reported experiencing greater experience of ostracism and more loneliness.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that low self-control can increase loneliness — and that this increase occurs partly via social ostracism due to selfish impulses or potentially harmful behaviour. This makes sense — you may be more likely to be faithful to a partner or co-operate at work or in a game if you have higher self-control, which could make you seem more desirable as a friend, partner, or social contact.</p>



<p>There are other explanations, however. Those with low self-control may be ostracising <em>themselves</em> — if you feel guilty or ashamed after a lapse in self-control, you might want to isolate yourself to deal with those feelings rather than being specifically excluded by others.</p>



<p>Future work could look at different kinds of self-control failure. If you fail to keep to a diet, for example, it only affects you — so would that lead to the same kind of ostracism that someone who can’t stop cheating on their partner might face? The team suggests that loneliness is more (or only) likely to occur when our actions have social repercussions; a closer look at this dynamic may shed more light on the relationship between ostracism, self-control and our social lives.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper "Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.</p>

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7" target="_blank">Erik Hoel (2021)</a>:<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of <i>overfitting</i>,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[sic]</span></span> hypothesis.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  </p><p>In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”</p><blockquote><p>The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). <br /><b>. . .</b><br /></p><p>To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">artificial neural networks</a> for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015. The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html" target="_blank">DeepDream</a> program is a visualization tool that shows what the layers of the neural network have learned:</p><blockquote>One way to visualize what goes on is to turn the network upside down and ask it to enhance an input image in such a way as to elicit a particular interpretation. </blockquote><p><br />The image above is characteristic of the hallucinogenic output from the DeepDream web interface, and it illustrates that the original training set was filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724110554/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/50616707-deepdream-avoiding-kitsch" target="_blank">dogs, birds, and pagodas</a>.  DeepDream images inspired blog posts with titles like, <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep" target="_blank">Do neural nets dream of electric sheep?</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/07/google-deepdream-its-dazzling-creepy-and-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-future-of-a-i.html" target="_blank">Do Androids Dream of Electric Bananas?</a> and my favorite, <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/07/scary-brains-and-garden-of-earthly-deep.html">Scary Brains and the Garden of Earthly Deep Dreams</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Reference</b></p><p>Hoel E.

<p><strong>Electric fish seem to have mastered the art of the pause</strong>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/electric-fish-pause/618993/">writes Katherine J. Wu</a> at <em>The Atlantic</em>. <em>Brienomyrus brachyistius </em>communicate by producing a series of electrical pulses. But researchers have found that the fish sometimes pause during their “conversations”, apparently as a signal that what they are about to communicate is important — similar to a “dramatic pause” in human speech.</p>

<p><strong>As we covered </strong><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/"><strong>in a recent podcast</strong></a><strong>, play is a vital part of children’s development. But how do the toys we choose to give kids shape their interests and skills?</strong> At<em> BBC Future</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains">Melissa Hogenboom explores</a> how gendered toys can reinforce existing stereotypes and biases.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have allowed a bind man to see again after 40 years, through the use of light-sensitive proteins injected into cells in the eye. </strong>With the help of specialised goggles, the man was able to make out high-contrast images, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01421-0">reports Sara Reardon</a> at <em>Nature</em>. The study represents the first clinical use of optogenetics, a technique often used in basic neuroscience research. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>..and in other optogenetics news, researchers have used the technique to manipulate social behaviours in mice. </strong>After inducing synchronous patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex of two mice, the team found that the animals became more social, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/science/optogenetics-brain-social-behavior.html">reports Virginia Hughes</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>. The work has interesting parallels with that on “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/">interbrain synchrony” in humans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Depending on the kinds of questions researchers ask, human memory can be seen as quite extraordinary — or really bad. </strong><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-memory-is-even-better-than-experts-thought/">Nicole C. Rust examines</a> the two perspectives at <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>Psychologists surely know enough about the replication crisis now to avoid uncritically citing work known to have issues… right? </strong>Not according to a recent study, which looked at how often researchers cite work that has failed to replicate, compared to more robust findings. The team found that studies with replication issues were cited 153 times more often than those without, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/for-research-citations-no-replication-is-no-problem/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica </em>— and those citations rarely mentioned the fact that the original paper had not replicated.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>Finally, why do we often denigrate — or even punish — those who perform acts of altruism?</strong> At The Observer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/23/why-are-we-so-uncharitable-to-those-doing-good-deeds">Nichola Raihani</a> explores why there is truth to the phrase “no good deed goes unpunished”.</p>

<h2>Where is the spinothalamic tract?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract is a collection of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations. The pathway starts with sensory neurons that synapse in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a>. Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation" target="_blank">decussate</a>, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a>, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a>. These neurons synapse with neurons in the thalamus, which then carry the information to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>. See below for more details on the pathway of the spinothalamic tract.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the spinothalamic tract and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract actually consists of two pathways that are distinct in function: the anterior spinothalamic tract and the lateral spinothalamic tract. </p><h3>Lateral spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. </p><p class="">Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor" target="_blank">nociceptors</a>, which detect painful sensations, or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor" target="_blank">thermoreceptors</a>, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a> that belong to cell groups like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius" target="_blank">nucleus proprius</a> or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa" target="_blank">substantia gelatinosa</a>; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.</p><p class="">The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl" target="_blank">ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus</a> in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system" target="_blank">anterolateral system</a>. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.</p><h3>Anterior spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. </p><p class="">These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.</p><h3>Damage to the spinothalamic tract</h3><p class="">A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.</p><h3>References:</h3><p class="">Augustine JR.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Pain is not a purely biological phenomenon: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301163?via%3Dihub">discrimination</a>, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189004382.pdf">anxiety around work</a>, and general <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/74/7/468.short">mental strain</a> have all been shown to contribute to the experience of chronic pain. Many researchers therefore take a biopsychosocial approach, exploring the multifarious factors that impact <em>on</em> and are impacted <em>by </em>pain.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038?saml_referrer">new study</a> in <em>Stress &amp; Health</em> explores the long term consequences of social factors on pain. The team, from the universities of Georgia and South California, Los Angeles, specifically focus on families involved in the 1980s “farm crisis” in the US Midwest, a period where many lost their jobs, land value crashed, and businesses failed — and finds that this financial stress is related to the experience of pain nearly 30 years later.</p>



<span id="more-42323"></span>



<p>Data was taken from a longitudinal study, which took place over 27 years and involved 508 married couples, who were all in early midlife at the start of the study in 1991.</p>



<p>The team tracked a number of measures for the study. A four-item scale measured family financial strain in 1991, 1994 and 2001, and participants also answered items related to financial stress (e.g. “we have enough money to afford the kind of clothing we need”) at the same points. Sense of control was measured ten years apart, in 1991 and 2001, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements such as “sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in life”.</p>



<p>Pain was assessed at two points later on in the study, with participants indicating how much pain they had experienced in the previous month, how severe that pain was, and how much it interfered with life and work. Participants were also presented with a list of nearly 50 physical health conditions and asked to indicate which they had experienced in the last year; these ranged from common colds to cancer.</p>



<p>The team found a correlation between family financial strain and a sense of control at all points — that is, those who experienced financial strain also felt a lack of control over their lives. Financial strain and a feeling of a lack of control at early points of the study were also directly linked to physical pain at later points, indicating that physical pain can be a consequence of stress not just concurrently but many years later. Those with higher family income were less likely to experience physical pain overall.</p>



<p>The <em>trajectories</em> of financial stress over the course of the study were also relevant to the experience of pain. Those who experienced increasing levels of financial strain over the years of the study also experienced a corresponding decline in their sense of control throughout the same period. This was the case even when controlling for other factors, such as age and physical illness, and was also linked to pain at the later points of the study.</p>



<p>It is unclear what is actually driving the link between loss of control and physical pain, however. The team has numerous suggestions: for instance, feeling out of control could lead people to make bad decisions that in turn lead to pain or physical ill health. Chronic stress can also cause long-lasting changes in brain circuits involved in our stress response, so neurological processes could also be involved in producing experiences of pain many years after stress was experienced. Future research could explore these possibilities, as well as other drivers of loss of control.</p>



<p>There are limitations to the findings though. For instance, those with higher family income may have been able to afford better healthcare and make healthier lifestyle choices when it came to diet, exercise, and non-gruelling work practices, which could in turn have made them less likely to experience pain.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the study does suggest that there is a direct link between loss of control and negative physical and emotional factors. Interventions that increase people’s sense of control may not ameliorate those structural or social factors that cannot be changed, like a poor economy or unemployment, but could go some way to mitigating their physical and emotional impacts.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We could all name groups of people who we know to be suffering right now; some in distant countries, some in our own. Research shows that we feel less empathy for people in other countries — and so are less likely to support them by protesting, say, or donating money. Meital Balmas and Eran Halperin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem now report a factor that can influence this, however: our feelings about the national leader. The pair’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989">study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> suggests that a leader who is perceived as “good” and popular at home elicits more empathy, and even greater tangible help, for their struggling citizens.</p>



<span id="more-42281"></span>



<p>Across four experiments, participants read fictitious reports about purported leaders in Belgium.  These articles painted the leaders in either a positive or a negative light, focusing on their trustworthiness and warmth (or lack of it), for example. The participants also read about the suffering of Belgian citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.</p>



<p>Initial studies on Israeli citizens found that when the “prime minister” was described in glowing, rather than negative, terms, participants reported feeling more empathy towards Belgian people, and reported being more willing to help families in distress. A subsequent study found that the perceived popularity of the prime minister was important, however: a PM described as being good and popular boosted empathy, while an unpopular one did not — even if they were described as being good. </p>



<p>The team then ran a version of this last study with 304 American adults. The methods were similar, but instead of reading about a terrorist attack, this time participants read about a Belgian teenager who was struggling to cope with the ravages and cost of treatment of his rickets. Repeating the earlier findings, when the country’s prime minister was presented as being popular, the participants exposed to the positive description reported more empathy for the teen and his family than those who’d read the negative report. They also said that they’d be more likely to sign a petition appealing to the Belgian government to help. And, when asked if they’d donate some of their fee for taking part in the study to the teenager and his family, they were more likely to agree.</p>



<p>What should we make of all these findings? “We know that national leaders provide rationale for opinion-building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens,” the researchers write. And they think this is what explains the results — when we think that a national leader who is a good person is popular, we tend to think that the nation’s people are likely to be good people, too, and we feel more empathy for their distress.</p>



<p>The work should have implications for leaders, the researchers think. “In recent decades, not only have national leaders served as main foci of the media coverage of international affairs but nowadays they have followers from all over the world via Twitter,” they write. This puts a “huge responsibility” on their shoulders, they add. “The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behaviour around the world.”</p>



<p>It is an interesting idea. Would people in other countries have felt as much sympathy for the people of Christchurch in the wake of the 2019 shootings, say, if New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern hadn’t seemed like such a good person — and also a popular prime minister? What if she’d more like — well, who? Insert your own least-liked democratically elected leader in that space…</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that of course the country used in this study  —  Belgium — is an open democracy. It might seem reasonable to infer that people who love and elect a “good” person are more likely to be “good” people, too. Unfortunately, of course, a huge amount of human suffering is happening in countries without a democratically elected leader. How that affects our empathy for those citizens is an important question that’s beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper "Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In the past few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have conducted a large number of studies into the effects of psychedelic drugs. Some have sought to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/16/neural-changes-after-taking-psychedelic-drugs-may-reflect-heightened-consciousness/">better</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/10/psilocybin-alters-brain-levels-of-the-neurotransmitter-glutamate-and-this-could-explain-why-users-experience-ego-dissolution/">understand</a> the effects of the drugs in the brain, while others are investigating the potential for substances like psilocybin and LSD <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9">to treat depression</a> and other mental health conditions.</p>



<p>This work obviously require tactful communication on the part of researchers: after all, they don’t want to alienate a public who may be at best ambivalent about the use of currently illegal drugs in research or mental health settings. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728">recent paper</a> in <em>Public Understanding of Science </em>highlights one thing researchers <em>shouldn’t</em> do: admit to using psychedelic substances themselves. The team finds that researchers who make such a disclosure may be seen by the public as having less integrity.</p>



<span id="more-42252"></span>



<p>In the first study, Matthias Forstmann at the University of Zurich and Christina Sagioglou at the University of Innsbruck asked 185 participants to read a vignette about a (fictitious) scientist who studies the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, and who has found some promising results regarding the use of psilocybin. Half read that the professor has “extensive personal experience” with the drugs himself, while the others read that he has no such experience.</p>



<p>All participants then assessed the professor’s scientific integrity, by rating how well he was described by six adjectives such as “professional” and “credible”. They also evaluated the quality of his research, rating it on adjectives like “valid” and “meaningful”.</p>



<p>Participants who had read that the researcher took the drugs himself rated his integrity significantly lower than those who had read he didn’t use them (this was true regardless of whether the participants themselves had experience taking psychedelics). However, this information didn’t influence people’s judgements about the quality of his research.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first, with a greater number of participants and more elaborate descriptions of the professor (for instance, participants saw a mock-up of a paper he had supposedly written). Participants were also asked about the <em>value</em> of the findings: whether healthcare providers should cover the costs of using psilocybin, for example. Again, those who read that the professor took psychedelics rated his integrity lower, but the two groups didn’t show any difference in their ratings of the quality or value of the work.</p>



<p>There are a few possible explanations for these results, the team notes. A researcher who studies psychedelics but also uses them might be seen as having a hidden agenda, for instance. Or perhaps it is the illegal nature of his drug use that makes it seem as though the researcher has less integrity. Further work will be needed to tease out these possibilities.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that the difference in integrity ratings wasn’t huge: in the first study, the non-drug-using professor received an average rating of 5.6 on a seven-point scale, compared to a rating of 5 for the researcher who took drugs. Still, the message of the study seems to be that researchers should consider keeping quiet about any drug use in their personal lives — or at least be aware that what they disclose can influence public perceptions.</p>



<p>And it’s not just what researchers themselves say that’s important, but also the context in which the research is presented. In a final study, participants read about a fictitious scientific conference on psychedelic drugs. All were given the same description of the scientific programme, but some read that various social events were happening which had associations with psychedelic culture (e.g. a shamanic drum circle and a psychedelic art exhibition), while the others read about social events which didn’t have these associations (e.g. a tour of a brewery and a postmodern art exhibition).</p>



<p>In this case, the association with psychedelic culture did lower participants’ perceptions of the quality of the research (though, interestingly, only among participants who hadn’t used psychedelic drugs themselves). “In order to positively impact the public’s perception of the quality of psychedelic research, it may be sensible to use less stereotypical imagery and language when talking about these substances, be it in media articles or scientific conferences,” the team concludes.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728">How psychedelic researchers’ self-admitted substance use and their association with psychedelic culture affect people’s perceptions of their scientific integrity and the quality of their research</a></p>

<p>It has already been a month since we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">announced</a> we’re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions! </p>



<p>The responses we’ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals–we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.</p>



<p>The journals’ websites now contain much more information on each  journal’s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Water</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></li></ul>



<p>If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate “jumping off point” for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. <strong>Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!</strong></p>



<p>For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/">Part 2 of this announcement</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/RKT0Al9FVu8/">Open for submissions (Part 2 – equitable OA models)</a></h4>

<p>Our five new journals are now <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Open for Submissions</a>! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. </p>



<p>If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Flat Fee </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">greements</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing</a>. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) </p>



<p>We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. </p>



<h3><strong>Institutional models for the five new journals</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Digital Health</a></em></strong> joins the group of journals covered by <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Flat Fee agreements</a> (covering <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>)</li><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</a></em></strong> has its own <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing</a> setup, similar to <em>PLOS Biology </em>and <em>PLOS Medicine, </em>to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.</li><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Climate</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Water</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Global Public Health</a></em></strong> offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Global Equity </strong></h4>



<p>Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:</p>



<ul><li>an <strong>institution’s </strong>research output in the relevant <strong>subject area</strong>,<strong> </strong>helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and </li><li>the relevant <strong>country’s </strong>World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). </li></ul>



<p>The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. </p>



<p><strong>Authors at institutions in </strong><a href="https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Research4Life</strong></a><strong> (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.</strong></p>



<p>The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in <em>PLOS Climate </em>would pay <strong>$350</strong> per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th></th><th>HIC</th><th>UMIC</th><th>L/LMIC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1</td><td>$6,000</td><td>$5,400</td><td>$2,100</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 2</td><td>$4,500</td><td>$4,050</td><td>$1,575</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3</td><td>$3,750</td><td>$3,375</td><td>$1,313</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$2,700</td><td>$1,050</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5</td><td>$2,000</td><td>$1,800</td><td>$700</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 6</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$900</td><td>$350</td></tr><tr><td>R4L</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td></tr></tbody></table>Global Equity model prices by research output tier and country category</figure>



<h4><strong>Summary Information and Comparison Table</strong></h4>



<p>Many of you reading this post are likely librarians or other people administering OA budgets. However, if you are an author and are simply interested in submitting to a PLOS journal that is of interest to you, <strong>please presume</strong> there is a way, <strong>that is appropriate for you and your context</strong>, that you will be able to publish in these new journals:</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The world is not exactly short of videos of cute cats up to strange antics. But one particular set of videos collected by cat owners during a COVID-19 lockdown reveals something genuinely interesting: a famous optical illusion that fools us also gets cats. The citizen science project, in which cats were experimented on in their own homes, shows that they, too, are tricked by “Kanizsa squares”, an illusion that suggests the presence of a square that doesn’t in fact exist.</p>



<span id="more-42227"></span>



<p>It’s well known that cats love to sit in enclosed spaces, like boxes. They even like to sit in square shapes made of tape, as documented during a 2017 Twitter craze (#CatSquare). So in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor">new study</a>, published in <em>Applied Animal Behaviour Science</em>, Gabriella E. Smith at City University of New York and colleagues took this further, to see if cats also show a preference for illusory squares.</p>



<p>Of the 500 pet cats and owners who signed up to take part, 30 completed all the trials. The owners “were not aware of the study’s investigative purpose at any point before or during the experiment”, the authors write. (Well, they weren’t told what it was about, at least.)</p>



<p>Every day for six days, each owner put their cat out of the room while they taped a pair of stimuli to the floor. The researchers instructed them each day on which two of three stimuli to use: an actual square, a Kanizsa square (in which four Pacman-type cut-outs are arranged to suggest the lines of a square) and the Kanizsa control (in which the Pacman-type cut-outs face the other way.)</p>

<p>The owner then put on sunglasses (so their cat couldn’t use their gaze as a cue to what to do), brought the cat into the room, and started videoing. If, within five minutes, their pet sat or stood within either of the shapes, the trial ended. Either way, after five minutes, they submitted the result.</p>



<p>Of those 30 cats who completed all the trials, nine cats chose to inside a stimulus at least once — and, in total between them, 16 times. On eight of these occasions, a cat sat inside an actual square. On seven, it sat inside a Kanizsa square. In contrast, the Kanizsa control was chosen only once. This suggests that cats treat the Kanizsa squares just like real ones. Like us (and dogs, chimps, and many other animals, in fact) they show “susceptibility to illusory contours.”</p>



<p>Recruiting pet owners to do experiments themselves clearly has some downsides. Very few of those who signed up actually completed the full study. Also, light levels might have varied quite a bit across the various homes, and this could have influenced the cats’ decisions, the team notes. However, there are also good reasons to study cats in their own homes, rather than a lab. As they’re more relaxed at home, their behaviour is likely to be more natural.</p>



<p>The study provides further evidence that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/09/heres-the-first-evidence-that-even-lizards-succumb-to-optical-illusions/">animals experience all kinds of illusions</a>. But it also gives further insight into cat cognition, which has received little attention compared to that of dogs. Quite why not isn’t clear. However, given the useful, if limited, data from this new study, the researchers write: “the use of citizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could greatly help bridge this divide.” </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There is ample evidence that inequality exists — in the UK alone, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/jan/03/richest-1-have-almost-a-quarter-of-uk-wealth-study-claims">one study</a> suggested, the richest 1% have a quarter of the country’s wealth, and <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-statistics">marginalised groups experience inequality</a> in relation to work, education, living standards, healthcare <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/assets/documents/research/gender-inequality-and-power-commission/Confronting-Gender-Inequality-blue.pdf">and more</a>.</p>



<p>However, not everyone is attentive to inequality. While some are keenly focused on its causes and its solutions, others believe it’s simply not important, or at the very least that it’s exaggerated. So what determines whether we pay attention to inequality?</p>



<p>A new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118">published</a> in <em>PNAS</em>, argues that our ideological stance on equality may be key. Unsurprisingly, the team finds that social egalitarians were more likely to notice signs of inequality — but only when it affected certain groups.</p>



<span id="more-42180"></span>



<p>In the first study, 2,204 participants were shown a series of photographs depicting urban scenes, half of which contained indications of inequality such as wealthy women receiving pedicures or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/">luxury cars</a>. Participants were then asked what they had noticed in the images, with no mention of inequality in the prompt. Finally, they completed a survey that measured their levels of social egalitarianism — that is, how much they prioritise social equality — indicating how much they agreed with statements like “Some groups of people must be kept in their place”. </p>



<p>Those with low levels of social egalitarianism were significantly less likely to specifically mention inequality or to mention the inequality-related indicators. Social egalitarians, on the other hand, were more likely to mention inequality.</p>



<p>As it was not clear whether those with low levels of social egalitarianism were noticing but failing to mention inequality or simply not seeing it at all, the second study focused on the detection of inequality. Participants viewed a series of pairs of images, one depicting a group of men and the other a group of women, each accompanied by a set of money bags. In equal trials, men and women had the same number of money bags, while in unequal trials the men were shown with more. Participants had to indicate whether the images depicted equal or unequal distribution of resources. Those high in social egalitarianism were more accurate at the task than those with low levels, suggesting that anti-egalitarians are less likely to notice inequality as well as less likely to mention it.</p>



<p>Each study so far had explored attention to inequality experienced by particularly marginalised groups such as women. So, in the next study, the team looked at whether social egalitarians were also better at noticing inequality against socially <em>advantaged</em> groups, too. Participants watched a video of a discussion panel, made up of two men and two women. In one condition, the men spoke one and a half times longer than the women, and in the other the women spoke one and a half times longer than the men. Participants were then asked whether men or women had spent more time speaking.</p>



<p>Social egalitarians were more likely to accurately notice when men spoke more than women; but when women spoke more than men, there was no significant difference between egalitarian and anti-egalitarian participants.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants were privy to a hiring process in which the employer was either biased against minorities or against white applicants. And as in the previous studies, social egalitarians were significantly more likely to notice bias against racial minorities, but less likely to notice bias against white candidates. Anti-egalitarians, however, were more likely to notice the anti-white bias.</p>



<p>So, the results suggest, social egalitarians are more attentive to social inequality against marginalised groups, and less likely to notice disadvantages against less marginalised groups like men or white people. (Another study conducted earlier this year similarly found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/04/advocates-of-equality-for-all-are-more-likely-to-show-prejudice-against-older-adults-at-work/">egalitarians were more likely to show prejudice against older people at work</a>, particularly older white men).</p>



<p>However, it’s worth remembering that inequalities against marginalised groups are structural and wide-ranging, significantly affecting millions of people on an everyday basis. For more advantaged groups, like white men, disadvantages are on a smaller scale — speaking less than women on a panel, to use an example from the study, is hardly a serious social inequality. In this respect, it makes sense that those concerned with social inequality focus their attention on those groups who are most affected by it.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that there aren’t areas in which men in particular are disadvantaged — male <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/01/male-suicide-rate-england-wales-covid-19">suicide rates,</a> for example, are extremely concerning. Further research could benefit from comparing more serious examples like this, where social egalitarians may be more attentive, rather than with small-scale issues like panel discussions.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/©-BillionPhotos.com_-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We are all aware of the effect COVID-19 has had on our day-to-day lives, but how about COVID’s effects on academia? The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our <a href="https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/">living evidence database</a>, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our research</a>, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.</p>
<p>The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.</p>
<p>To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Proportions of epidemiological study designs<br />
</strong>Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.</p>
<p>Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.</p>
<p>Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.</p>
<p>Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).</p>
<p><strong>Time-study type trends<br />
</strong>Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.</p>
<p><strong>What does it all mean?<br />
</strong>Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.</p>
<p>The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2">promising approach for the triage of publication</a> types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6">prevent research waste</a>.</p>

<p>Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper "Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Three people are walking down the street, two women and one man. One of the women trips and falls. Which of the two observers will feel more empathy for her pain? Hundreds of studies suggest that it’ll be the woman. However, these results almost overwhelmingly come from self-reports. Objective evidence that women genuinely feel more empathy than men is very thin on the ground. This has led to the idea that women report more empathy not because they actually feel it but to conform to societal expectations that they should. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x">a new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> claims to provide evidence that, even when they think no one else is looking or asking, girls show more empathy than boys.</p>



<span id="more-42159"></span>



<p>Joyce F Benenson at the University of Quebec and colleagues set up pairs of 5- to 7-year-old children, so that one member of the pair would suffer a misfortune, and the other would witness it. The members of each of the 32 female pairs and 23 male pairs knew each other, but weren’t considered by their teachers to be best friends or enemies. (The researchers sex-matched the pairs because earlier studies have suggested that we feel more empathy for people of the same sex — so any sex difference in empathy should be easier to spot.)</p>



<p>Each pair was taken to a room in their own school. It was empty but for two baskets of plastic building blocks by the entrance, and a table at the far end. The children were asked if they’d be willing to take the blocks to the table and build a tower. (The somewhat elaborate full story involved alien children who needed to contact their parents; the children all seemed to want to take part, the researchers report.) Before leaving the room, the experimenter did warn them that one basket was a little broken, so if a child found that their blocks fell, they should just pick up them up with their hands and carry them over to the table. </p>



<p>Hidden cameras then recorded what happened when the researchers remote-operated one of the baskets to split, causing that child’s bricks to tumble out. The team focused on the other child’s reactions, and rated them according to four “empathy indicators”: looking at the victim for more than three seconds; ceasing their own activity for longer than a second; ceasing their activity until the other child had placed a block on the tower; and actively intervening by picking up the basket or blocks.</p>



<p>Eight of the girls, and none of the boys, engaged in all four behaviours (though seven girls and five boys did not engage in any at all). Overall, significantly more girls than boys looked at the victim for more than three seconds and gave them chance to recover before placing their own block. The female bystanders “exhibited more empathic behaviour than male bystanders”, the team concluded, adding: “It is highly likely that females do experience greater feelings of empathy which motivate them to behave in ways that display more concern for victims.”</p>



<p>It is possible. It could be that, as the researchers argue, they have found behavioural indicators of sex differences in empathy. But there are other potential explanations. It might be that girls are more patient than boys, or more agreeable (there is research finding that girls and women tend to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Overlapping-distributions-of-Agreeableness-for-men-and-women-Vertical-axis-indicates_fig10_51594567">score higher on this personality trait</a> than males), or that the boys were more competitive and prioritised getting on with building over acting on whatever empathy they felt for their partner. In fact, the majority of boys did pause whatever they were doing following the accident. Most didn’t show other “empathic activities”, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they weren’t feeling the same empathy for their unlucky partners as the girls. Perhaps girls really do feel more empathy, but it’s not possible to conclude that from this study.       </p>

<img alt="Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'" class="wp-image-12397 alignright" height="266" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg" width="246" />
<p style="text-align: left;">In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in <em>BMC Psychology</em>) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.</p>
<p>Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.</p>
<p>The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.</p>
<p>As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12396" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12396 size-medium" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em>, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12398" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital." class="size-medium wp-image-12398" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The results of their qualitative study have now been published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em> revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12399" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background ." class="size-medium wp-image-12399" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in <em>BMC Research Notes</em>. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.</p>
<p>By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.</p>
<p>These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a study published in <em>BMC Pediatrics</em> Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Are our personalities set in stone, or can we choose to change them? </strong>In this bonus episode, Matthew Warren talks to former <em>Research Digest</em> editor <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a> about his new book <em>Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change</em>. Christian discusses the evidence-based methods you can use to alter your personality, whether you’re an introvert who wants to become the life of the party, or you simply wish you were a little more open to new experiences. He also explains how our personalities evolve over the course of our lifespans, even when we’re not consciously trying to change them, and ponders how they might be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p><em>Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change</em> is out on May 18th in the United States and May 20th in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Smell is often considered to be a particularly evocative sense: if you haven’t yourself been transported back in time by a nostalgic scent then you’ll almost certainly be familiar with the phenomenon via reference to the famous <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/">Proustian rush.</a> Scent is also increasingly being used in marketing, with some <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022243718820585">evidence</a> suggesting that smell can influence consumers’ judgements and decisions.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1231">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal for Consumer Psychology</em>, takes a closer look at how smell interacts with other senses to influence our perceptions. The team, led by the University of South Florida’s Dipayan Biswas, finds that looking at food before smelling it may enhance our enjoyment of what we eat. </p>



<span id="more-42093"></span>



<p>In the first study, 198 students were split into four conditions. In all conditions, five pieces of a red strawberry-flavoured fruit snack were placed in front of participants inside an opaque envelope. In the first condition, participants smelled the snack first before looking inside the envelope; in the second, participants looked at the snack before smelling it; and in the final two conditions, participants were instructed to either only smell or only look at the snack.</p>



<p>All participants then rated the expected taste of the snack, as well as describing its smell and colour. They were then allowed to eat the fruit snack, and rated their perception of the actual taste and how much they liked it. Finally, they stated whether or not they would recommend it to a friend and were asked whether they either wanted an entry into a prize draw for a gift card or a pouch of the snack they had just sampled.</p>



<p>Expected taste was more favourable in the condition where participants saw the food before they smelled it; those in this condition also evaluated the snack more favourably <em>after</em> tasting. These participants were also more likely to recommend the snack to a friend, and more likely to accept the full sized pouch at the end of a survey than to enter the prize draw. Together, this suggests that seeing the food before smelling it had a favourable impact on enjoyment. A second study, which replicated the first but with a fizzy drink, and a third which did the same with a cookie, produced similar results.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants either received lemonade that was coloured purple, so that its look was incongruent with its lemony smell, or that retained its clear “natural” colour. When the scent was consistent with the look of the beverage, those who saw the drink before they smelled it again reported that it tasted better than those who smelled it before they saw it. However, when the visual cue was incongruent with the smell, taste was rated in a similar way in both conditions.</p>



<p>The team suggests when people see and then smell a food or drink, it’s easier to process the smell, leading to increased taste perception. But when the visual cues are incongruent with the smell, seeing first and then smelling can actually make it harder to process the smell, as the smell seems inconsistent with the colour. This could be a sign that food and drink manufacturers should stay away from artificial colouring that doesn’t match expected taste or smell.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that having a good look at your food before you smell it could lead to increased enjoyment. Unless you’re willing to put a peg on your nose while you cook, however, this might be difficult to enact when you’re making your own dinner. But for premade food purchased in supermarkets, bakeries or elsewhere, clever packaging could enhance enjoyment.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><blockquote><p>Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials">Faster Together</a>. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x">our manuscript</a>, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials">course</a> consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.</p>
<p>Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.</p>

<p><strong>A neural implant has allowed a paralysed individual to type by imagining writing letters</strong>. The implant of 200 electrodes in the premotor cortex picks up on the person’s intentions to perform the movements associated with writing a given letter, translating these into a character on a screen. The individual was able to type 90 characters per minute with minimal errors, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/neural-implant-lets-paralyzed-person-type-by-imagining-writing/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Robin Dunbar famously estimated that humans are limited to having around 150 friends, due to cognitive restrictions imposed by the size of our brains.</strong> Now a new study challenges the accuracy of Dunbar’s number, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/science/dunbars-number-debunked.html">as Jenny Gross reports</a> at <em>The New York Times</em> (though Dunbar in turn disputes the findings).</p>

<p><strong>Poor sleep can make us less able to focus on a task at hand and ignore distractions</strong>. That’s according to a study comparing the performance on an attention test of 23 people with insomnia and 23 good sleepers.

<p><strong>An analysis of bacteria in the teeth of Neanderthals and ancient <em>Homo sapiens</em> has found that both groups ate lots of starchy foods.</strong> This in turn suggests that their common ancestor was already eating these kinds of foods more than 600,000 years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/neanderthals-carb-loaded-helping-grow-their-big-brains">reports Ann Gibbons</a> at <em>Science</em>. This was a time when hominin brains became a lot bigger, so the researchers think that the starch gave ancient humans the energy needed to fuel this growth.</p>

<p>To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point <em>t</em>, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time <em>t</em> is required. Our algorithm <em>Cascade</em> (<a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>; CC-BY-NC 4.0):</p>

<p>However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.</p>



<p><a href="http://ringachlab.net/">Dario Ringach</a> recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point <em>t</em> to perform reliable spike inference?</p>



<p>Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6810" data-attachment-id="6810" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-1-2" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png" data-orig-size="869,726" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-2/" height="264" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=869" width="317" /></figure></div>



<p>The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).</p>



<p>But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).</p>



<p>It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after <em>t</em> are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6812" data-attachment-id="6812" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-1-3" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png" data-orig-size="2022,665" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">Fig. S1 of the preprint</a>) are indeed faster than for other datasets.</p>



<p>Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after <em>t</em> before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005">calcium buffering</a> and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.</p>



<p>The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py">Cascade’s Github repository</a>. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>



<ol><li> Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time<em> t</em> are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.<br /></li><li>To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.</li></ol>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>After an incredibly stressful day of work, which are you more likely to do: walk several miles home, or get on a bus straight to your door? While the first option certainly comes with increased health benefits — including, potentially, decreased stress — many of us would choose the second anyway.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-72489-001">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</em>, seeks to understand why, even when we know how positive exercise can be, we often fail to be active after work. It could come down to how high-pressure your job is, according to Sascha Abdel Hadi from Justus-Liebig-University Giessen and team — and how much control you have over your work.</p>



<span id="more-42073"></span>



<p>In the first study, 100 participants took part in a workplace simulation. Adopting the role of a call centre worker, participants answered emails from customers, solved maths problems related to product pricing and promotions, and answered a live customer call.</p>



<p>In the low demand condition, emails and phone calls were from friendly customers, while in the high demand condition, customers were disgruntled; maths problems also ranged in difficulty based on condition. High demand participants were also explicitly instructed to “<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/cost-smile">serve with a smile</a>”, while the low demand condition only required “acting authentically”.</p>



<p>Following these tasks, participants were invited to ride (up to a maximum of fifteen minutes) on a static bike in the break room, for as long as they wanted, after which they could read magazines in a seated position. As expected, those in the high demand condition spent significantly less time on the bike than those in the low demand condition.</p>



<p>A second study, conducted with 144 participants, sought to expand on these findings — only this time, there was an additional focus on the control people had over the choices they made during the job. In addition to the high and low demand conditions  from the first study, participants were assigned to a high or low control condition. Participants in the high control condition could select which emails they responded to and in which order, which arithmetic problems they wanted to solve, and which customer requests they picked up via call. Low control participants could do none of these things.</p>



<p>Again, participants with a more demanding job spent less time on the bike. And while there was no direct relationship between levels of control and time spent on the bike, there was an indirect effect of job control on cycling time through its impact on participant’s feelings of self-determination — their beliefs that they are autonomous and able to freely make choices. People in the low control condition rated their self-determination as lower, which in turn led to reduced time cycling. This suggests that high levels of control can improve self-determination — and, indirectly, increase self-motivated behaviour, even outside of the workplace.</p>



<p>This last point is key. What we do at work (or perhaps more accurately, what is done to or imposed on us) doesn’t just affect the hours we spend in the office, in the factory, or on the shop floor. Rather, these things seep into our personal lives, making us more or less likely to use leisure time the way we might want. The team suggests that other mechanisms could also play a role in the link between job demands and exercise: for instance, if people are unable to “switch off” from work demands, this may hamper motivation to engage in activities like working out.</p>



<p>Either way, it is clear that jobs with high levels of demand can impact not only our overall wellbeing but our motivation outside of work. The team suggests that employers should place greater importance on self-determination and participation; and, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/09/involvement-in-workplace-democracy-can-alter-your-view-of-authority/">other research suggests</a>, this could also change how democratic, just and participatory workplaces are.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Open for Whom?</a>” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  </p>



<p>Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. </p>



<p>Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  </p>



<p><strong>Today</strong>, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Training Centre in Communication</a></strong>, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TCC Africa</a></strong>. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.</p>



<p>Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.</p>



<p>We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper "Event-Driven Sensing for Efficient Perception: Vision and Audition Algorithms".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You want to choose a new vacuum cleaner, or book, or hotel, or kids’ toy, or movie to watch — so what do you do? No doubt, you go online and check the star ratings for various options on sites such as Amazon or TripAdvisor, and so benefit from the wisdom of crowds.</p>



<p>However, there are problems with this star-based system, as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01098-5">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> makes clear. Firstly, most ratings are positive — so how do you choose between two, or potentially many more, products with high ratings, or even the same top rating? Secondly, star ratings aren’t a great predictor of the success (and so actual general appeal and approval) of a movie, book, and so on, note Matthew D. Rocklage at the University of Massachusetts and his colleagues. The team presents an alternative method for picking the best product and also predicting success, which focuses on the emotional responses of the reviewers.</p>



<span id="more-42060"></span>



<p>In all four studies reported in the paper, the team used a text analysis tool called the Evaluative Lexicon. This provided measures of the average emotionality and valence (positivity) of a review. Emotionality relates to how much an attitude is rooted in emotion, rather than how positive or negative it is (so reviews that included lots of terms like “awe-inspiring” or “enchanting” got higher emotionality scores than reviews with terms like “impeccable”.)</p>



<p>First, the team looked at the earliest 30 reviews for all movies included on the website metacritic.com from 2005 to 2018. For each movie, they gathered star ratings (from 0 to 10), valence scores and measures of text emotionality.</p>



<p>Overall, 81% of these movies got above average star-ratings. This highlights “the challenge of discerning success and how people will behave in this sea of positive ratings”, which the team calls the “positivity problem”. They also found that star ratings weren’t a good predictor of box office revenue, and text valence wasn’t a helpful predictor, either. Higher emotionality was a positive predictor of future box office takings, however. (This result held when they controlled for a variety of factors, including the genre of the movie, the year it was released, its budget, and so on.)</p>



<p>Next, Rocklage and colleagues used the same approach to try to predict the sales of all books listed on Amazon.com from 1995 to 2015. This time, for some genres, star ratings did predict sales, while for others they didn’t. However, greater emotionality emerged as a predictor of sales across 93 different genres. It was, then, consistently useful.</p>



<p>The researchers then turned to 187,206 real-time tweets posted in response to TV ads for 84 different businesses played during the 2016 and 2017 US Super Bowls. The team found that the greater the emotionality of the tweets about an advert, the more Facebook followers the company gathered over the next two weeks. The equivalent of star ratings for these ads had been gathered by the newspaper USA Today, and these ratings were not predictive of followers.</p>



<p>Finally, the team considered Chicago restaurant reviews on yelp.com and 1.3 million table reservations made on a popular booking website. In contrast to earlier results, high star ratings did predict more table reservations. However, higher emotionality still emerged as a unique predictor of numbers of bookings. As the team writes, “restaurants that elicited more emotion were associated with more table reservations”.</p>



<p>Overall, then, movies, books and restaurants that appeared to evoke more emotion in consumers ended up being more successful. Why might that be the case? Emotions flag memories as being important, and are relatively readily recalled, and attitudes based on emotion <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/19/opinions-based-on-feelings-are-surprisingly-stable/">tend to be more stable</a>. Clearly this could influence a person’s own behaviour. “Additional work could explore whether attitudes based more on emotion also affect success by increasing individuals’ propensity to spread information via word of mouth,” the team notes.</p>



<p>Overall, the new work does call into question the validity and helpfulness of star ratings. This in itself is not new, but of course the researchers also describe what seems to be a more useful system, which in theory could be broadly adopted. “One possibility is that organizations could consider aggregating reviewers’ language and providing an ‘emotional star rating’ to provide more meaningful assessments to individuals,” they write.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/">10+ years of Brainhack: an open, inclusive culture for neuro tool developers at all levels</a></h4>

<p>Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2">in Neuron</a>, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.</p>



<p>Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq" /></figure>



<p>Figure 1D from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001" rel="nofollow">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001</a></p>



<p>A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>



<p>The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.</p>



<h2>The five defining Brainhack features: </h2>



<p>1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving</p>



<p>2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods</p>



<p>3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators</p>



<p>4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and </p>



<p>5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages</p>



<p>Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. </p>



<p>Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. </p>



<p><br />Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.</p>



<p>The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/">Jupyter Book </a> that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper "Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.</p>

<p>A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. </p>



<p>On his blog <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/">For Better Science</a> (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. </p>



<p>Webster has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22">69 papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. </p>



<span id="more-2562"></span>



<p>Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board">Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine</a>, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C">here</a>. </p>



<p>The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C">explained by the first author on PubPeer </a>as  “<em>the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles</em>” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/">This Image Is Fine Award</a> in November 2020. </p>



<p>The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote <em>“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”</em>. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. </p>

In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE" rel="nofollow">https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C" rel="nofollow">https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C</a></figure>



<p>Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5">International Journal of Nanomedicine</a>, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. </p>



<p>Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. </p>



<p>As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. </p>



<p>Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. </p>

<p>PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">launch</a> of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in <em>PLOS ONE</em> earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  </p>



<p>Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>The first, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435">Satoru Joshita and colleagues</a>, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. </p>



<p>The second, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791">John Cole and colleagues</a>, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. </p>

          <p>Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols">Submission Guidelines</a> have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. </p>



<p>We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols">Lab Protocol</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. This unique article type was developed in partnership with <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a>, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! </p>



<p>Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/05/01/heating-up-the-objective-for-two-photon-imaging/">Heating up the objective for two-photon imaging</a></h4>

<p>To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>; see also <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012">Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012</a>). Is this a problem?</p>



<p>Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493">Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020</a>), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.</p>



<p>For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial <a href="http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater">objective heating device</a> with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author <a href="https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038">Serge Charpak</a> was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy <a href="https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html">thermocouple</a> element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.</p>



<p>Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6792" data-attachment-id="6792" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="heating_pad" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,606" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000" />Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.</figure>



<p>Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6794" data-attachment-id="6794" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="constantan" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,641" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000" />Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.</figure>



<p>To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (<a href="https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx">this one</a>). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.</p>



<p>Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was <a href="https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf">this one</a>) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (<a href="https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/">explained here</a>). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6796" data-attachment-id="6796" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="thermosensor" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,666" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/thermosensor/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=1000" />A repurposed heating block to read out a thermistor. We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.</figure>



<p>The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.</p>



<p>Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! </p>



<p>The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.</p>

Roll out of first open access books fully funded by Opening the Future

We're thrilled to announce that our Opening the Future library membership programme has reached the threshold needed to begin funding the first titles in open access.

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JdJdcrkMka4/">The importance of early career researchers for promoting open research</a></h4>

<p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS’ Director of Open Research Solutions</p>



<p><em>Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers – as found in PLOS research released as a<a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/"> preprint this week</a>.</em></p>



<p>At the end of March 2021 <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">introduced</a> a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal’s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large – determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal’s community of editors and researchers.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725">more than 40%</a> of papers published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>voluntarily shared their code already, <em>requiring</em> more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:<br /></p>



<ul><li>Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?</li><li>What proportion of researchers’ papers generate code?</li><li>What concerns do they have about code sharing?</li><li>How common are these concerns?</li><li>How much would submissions to the journal be affected?</li><li>Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?</li></ul>



<p>Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025">survey dataset</a> that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">released as a preprin</a>t. As well as supporting the journal’s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing – relative to other open research practices such as data sharing – and researchers’ experiences with sharing code and software.</p>



<p>The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which — at least in principle — would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns — a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents’ previous publications could have shared code.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18885" height="433" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png" width="1006" /></figure>



<p>Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 <a href="https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1">peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society</a>, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 2.</em></strong><em> Respondents were asked “If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18886" height="249" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png" width="512" /></figure>



<p>Also, similar to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/">what we discovered about researchers’ needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020</a>, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share <em>their own</em> code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers’ code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal’s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility – and ultimately reuse – of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-health-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, represent the primary cause of mortality worldwide. An increasing volume of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accounts for the majority of recent surges in the global NCD burden.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, increasing humanitarian crises in LMICs have resulted in the global forced displacement of people reaching record highs, with the average length of displacement now greater than 20 years. Until recently, the problem of NCDs in conflict-affected populations was largely neglected. However, with growing awareness of the challenges NCDs represent in humanitarian settings, clinical guidance has been developed for chronic NCD care in LMICs.</p>
<p>Since 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"><em>Médecins Sans Frontières</em> (MSF)</a> has supported the Jordanian health system by providing multidisciplinary, primary level NCD care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians living in Irbid, Jordan. This week in <em>BMC Health Services Research</em>, <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06333-3">Ansbro <em>et al. </em></a>describe their experiences with MSF, adapting the <a href="https://www.re-aim.org/about/what-is-re-aim/">RE-AIM framework</a> to evaluate MSF’s program of NCD care.</p>
<p>RE-AIM is a framework consisting of five elements, <em>Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance</em>. The framework was originally developed to encourage program planners, evaluators, funders, and policy-makers to be more attentive to essential program elements, to improve sustainable adoption, and promote the implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions. In this study, through the use of mixed methods, Ansbro <em>et al.</em> examined the RE-AIM five key elements of the MSF Syrian refugee NCD program.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12355" style="width: 410px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12355 size-full" height="363" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/RE-AIM_resized-e1619620846606.png" width="400" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00143/full">Ory <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<h3><strong>Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption</strong></h3>
<p>Most areas of the program were viewed as acceptable to patients, staff, and stakeholders. Although the care was free, patients were burdened with indirect costs, like paying for transport, to attend clinics, potentially outweighing the benefits of ‘free’ care.</p>
<p>The program achieved good clinical outcomes for treating patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, more research in the future that uses longer follow-up periods is needed to understand the prevalence or outcomes of major complications of NCDs.</p>
<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>A key challenge for implementation was the impact of Syrian patients’ experiences of war, loss, and social suffering on their engagement with NCD care. Staff also shared concerns that they could not manage medical problems in isolation from the psychosocial issues patients faced and they felt ill-equipped to handle patients’ war-related trauma.</p>
<p>Patients and staff also reported that the referral pathways for specialist services were troublesome and confusing. Funding for specialist referral pathways was limited, even though MSF managed to secure additional funding. This highlights the need for future programs to securely implement specialist referral pathways, ensuring they are designed to be affordable and accessible from the start.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintenance </strong></h3>
<p>A key challenge for maintaining the program was cost. High costs were partly responsible for the program’s limited coverage and scope. However, there is room for adaptations. For example, MSF introduced nurse task sharing, which could lead to cost savings.</p>
<p>Another challenge here is the availability of highly qualified family medicine specialists, for the management of patients with complex needs. While MSF had access to a large number of highly qualified Jordanian staff on this occasion, this is often not the case in all humanitarian crisis settings. This issue is difficult to address, but the authors propose potential workarounds, like telemedicine, as a possible solution for future programs.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-12357 aligncenter" height="175" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-_unsplash_strip.jpg" width="450" />
<p>Research in humanitarian crisis settings is extremely difficult. Not only do governments and humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in effectively tackling NCDs in LMICs, but the evaluation of interventions in humanitarian settings is equally as challenging. Still, this study demonstrated that RE-AIM is a valuable tool to guide complex interventions in humanitarian crisis settings. Ansbro <em>et al.</em> bridge a knowledge gap in the delivery of care in humanitarian settings, however, more research is urgently needed to strengthen responses to NCDs in humanitarian crisis settings. Future programs need to focus on simplifying care models, reducing costs, and harnessing telehealth resources.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper "Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.</p>

<p class="">The inferior and superior olivary nuclei are distinct in function. The inferior olivary nucleus is typically subdivided into the <em>principal olive, medial accessory olive, </em>and <em>dorsal accessary olive</em>, and is thought to play an important role in movement, coordination, and movement-related learning. The superior olivary nucleus consists of the <em>lateral superior olive</em> and <em>medial superior olive,</em> as well as a number of surrounding nuclei known as the <em>periolivary nuclei</em>.

<p class="">The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlear</a> nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus" target="_blank">inferior colliculus</a>, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.</p><h2><br />References:</h2><p class="">Paul MS, M Das J.

<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731">Stevenson and Kording</a> (2011), the authors estimated that <a href="https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/">every 7.4 years, the number of neurons we can record with doubles</a>. Think of it as Moore’s law for brain recordings. Since then, <a href="https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/">Stevenson has updated the estimate</a>, which now stands at 6 years. Could it be that progress itself is accelerating? </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218">Matteo Carandini raised a question</a>: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">a double-exponential curve</a>: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img alt="Doubling times" height="528" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png" width="753" />image <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png">CC BY Steve Jurvetson</a></figure>



<p>But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662">Urai et al. (2021)</a> – generously released under a CC-BY license – and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (<a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times">code here</a>). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It’s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature – 4.5 years. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7621" data-attachment-id="7621" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-8" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png" data-orig-size="775,554" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-8-2/" height="269" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=775" width="377" /></a>A log-linear model of progress in electrophysiology</figure></div>



<p>On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers – hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that’s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. </p>



<p>We can do one better – fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> – a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here’s what that looks like:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7617" data-attachment-id="7617" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png" data-orig-size="779,527" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/" height="276" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779" width="408" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time – and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7619" data-attachment-id="7619" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png" data-orig-size="752,555" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-7-2/" height="278" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=752" width="377" /></a></figure></div>



<p>These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 – of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7623" data-attachment-id="7623" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-9" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png" data-orig-size="783,527" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-9/" height="257" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=783" width="383" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, <a href="https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/">including Facebook</a>, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1">adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors</a> to electrophysiology. </p>



<p>Thus, this generalized Moore’s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes – but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter – <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995">and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this</a>.</p>



<p>Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time – perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain’t what it used to be, and it’s coming far faster than we’ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There’s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is – perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lATQ057kTUbbLJBB5YJDDQZ0u6TsnV3L?usp=sharing">Ian Stevenson re-did the analysis with slightly different models</a>, and found some slightly different results (longer doubling times than those reported here), from 4.5 to 5.6 years, depending on the assumptions. These are doubling times are nevertheless shorter than the ones reported previously in the literature so far, so the larger point still stands: the future is happening faster than we thought just a few years ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/ihstevenson/status/1387439844641628161">Read the thread here</a>.</p>
