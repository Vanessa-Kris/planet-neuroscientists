                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/avT0IejgGzI/">Live-streamed Preprint Journal Clubs!!!</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/preprint-moon-landing_4-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Note: This post was written in collaboration with the PREreview team (Monica Granados, Samantha Hindle, Daniela Saderi)</em></p>
<p>We are teaming up with <u><a href="http://www.prereview.org">PREreview</a></u> during <u><a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">Open Access week</a></u> to bring together scientists from around the world to discuss and review an actual preprint…live-streamed!</p>
<p>PREreview helps scientists receive acknowledgement for their time spent reviewing others’ work. We are proud to collaborate with them to shine a spotlight on our shared goals: to encourage more scientists to post feedback on preprints, and to provide credit for their contributions to peer review. PREreview’s aim is to promote the discussion of preprints at journal clubs by providing resources and a platform where these discussions can be shared, and to ensure reviews are citable by assigning a digital object identifier (DOI) for each preprint review.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Open Access week, together we decided to leverage today’s technology to make these journal clubs more accessible to a diverse group of scientists by running them entirely online!</p>
<p>Want to participate? Read on for more details.</p>
<p><strong>What is a preprint and how can it enhance your research?</strong></p>
<p>Preprints are open access scientific manuscripts that have not yet been through editorial peer review. Because they are shared freely online while undergoing more formal peer review in a journal, they accelerate the communication of knowledge, thereby increasing the impact and reach of scientific discovery. Backed by many <a href="http://asapbio.org/funder-policies"><u>funders</u></a>, <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies">journals</a></u>, and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/university-policies">institutions</a></u>, preprints have become a legitimate part of research dissemination. To learn more about how preprints can help you and your science move forward, visit <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><u>PLOS’ preprint resource page</u> </a>and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq#qe-faq-637">ASAPbio.org</a></u>.</p>
<p>One of the many advantages of preprinting is the potential for authors to receive immediate feedback from the rest of the scientific community and improve their article before formal publication in a journal. In a sense, it’s similar to the feedback one might receive after a talk or a poster presentation at a scientific meeting, except that it makes the process easier and more inclusive because anyone with internet connection around the world could comment on your work.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan – Join us and become part of the discussion!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT</strong></p>
<p>We will facilitate three interactive preprint journal club events that will be live-streamed via videoconference in which anyone can participate remotely. The focus will be on neuroscience, bioinformatics and ecology. Each online journal club will be hosted by two facilitators with experience in mediating video calls, as well as subject matter experts. They will guide participants through a constructive discussion of the preprint and collate feedback into a review report. These PREreviews will receive a DOI and will be shared online with the community as citable and discoverable objects. For more information about the format of PREreview online preprint journal clubs, check out <u><a href="https://www.prereview.org/users/153686/articles/325778-open-access-week-preprint-journal-club-information">PREreview’s information doc</a></u> or email contact@prereview.org.</p>
<p><strong>WHO</strong></p>
<p>You! We encourage all interested researchers to be part of the discussion and offer their expertise. Of course, anyone who wants to see the power of preprints in action is also welcome. All you need is an internet connection or phone-in capabilities to join.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>Your ability to accurately understand your own thoughts and behaviour in a given moment can have rather profound consequences. If you don’t realise you’re growing loud and domineering during a heated company meeting, that could affect your standing at work. If you react in an oversensitive manner to a fair and measured criticism levelled at you by your romantic partner, it could spark a fight.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder, then, that psychology researchers are interested in the question of how well people understand how they are acting and feeling in a given moment, a concept known as <i>state self-knowledge </i>(not to be confused with its better-studied cousin <i>trait self-knowledge</i>, or individuals’ ability to accurately gauge their own personality characteristics that are relatively stable over time).</p>
<p>In a new study <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/sg5aw/">available as a preprint on PsyArXiv</a>, Jessie Sun and Simine Vazire of the University of California, Davis adopted a novel, data-heavy approach to gauging individuals’ levels of personality state self-knowledge (i.e. their personality as it manifested in the moment), and it revealed some interesting findings about the ways in which people are – and aren’t – able to accurately understand their own fleeting psychological states.</p>
<p><span id="more-34856"></span></p>
<p>The study, provisionally titled “Do People Know What They’re Like in the Moment?” had two main components. First, 434 Washington University of St. Louis students were texted four times a day for 15 days and asked to rate themselves on four of the Big Five personality characteristics based on how they had felt and behaved during the previous hour: Extraversion, Agreeableness (only “if they reported that they were around others during the target hour”), Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. Of these 434 participants, 311 also wore a recording device paired with an iPod touch that recorded for 30 seconds every nine and a half minutes from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day, generating a huge amount of audio data. (Before researchers had full access to the recordings, students were allowed to listen to them and erase anything they didn’t want the researchers to hear, but only 99 files were deleted from a cache that became “152,592 usable recordings from 304 participants.”)</p>
<p>Second, a veritable small army of research assistants – more than a hundred – listened to the recordings and rated the speakers on the same four personality states they had previously rated themselves on. For a subset of the study participants, then, researchers had three useful pieces of information: recordings of them going about their lives, participants’ rating of their own personality states during those periods, and outside observers’ rating of those same states. This allowed the researchers to measure the extent to which self-ratings correlated with other-ratings – that is, did Tom’s view that he was quite extroverted during a given hour match up with how others who heard him on audio interpreted his behaviour during snippets of that period?</p>
<p>And measure they did, generating a pretty cool series of graphs (see above). The more acute the positive, upward slope, the more there was agreement between self- and other-ratings. So as you can see, Extraversion was, by a significant margin, the personality characteristic for which people seemed to have the most accurate self-knowledge. This shouldn’t necessarily be a surprise. For one thing, while intuition isn’t always an accurate guide on such matters, common sense would suggest that people are well aware of the extent to which they are actively and enthusiastically engaging in social activity, and that we’re all pretty good at judging <i>others’ </i>level of extraversion as well. Second, the authors note that this finding is “consistent with a large body of literature demonstrating high self-observer agreement on trait extraversion across a wide range of conditions.” The state with second-highest subject-observer agreement, as the graph shows, was Conscientiousness (again, perhaps because in-the-moment conscientious behaviour is pretty easy for both the self and others to discern).</p>
<p>What about the two other personality states, where there was significantly less subject-observer agreement? The tricky part about interpreting these findings, as the authors point out, is that there are two possible explanations: the first is that the subject really does lack insight into their temporary psychological states and that the external observers’ observations accurately captured this; and the second is that the <i>observer </i>was wrong because they only had access to a limited slice of audio that simply might not be enough to accurately gauge the subject’s state at that moment (remember, the raters had no visual information to go on – no body language, facial expressions, or anything else).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So when it comes to Agreeableness and that rather flat line – meaning little agreement between subjects and observers – the authors argue that “it is plausible that people have less self-insight into their momentary agreeableness,” because Agreeableness has so much more to do with external, observable behaviours, and with other people’s perceptions of your warmth, than with internal “thoughts and feelings” (meaning that other people might naturally be better judges of this personality state). Neuroticism, on the other hand, is different – it’s a state much more characterised by internal feelings than by outward behaviour. So in that case, Sun and Vazire argue that their findings alone shouldn’t be seen as supporting the idea that people are bad at self-rating their present level of Neuroticism – rather, it’s more likely the audio just didn’t give the observers enough to go on.</p>
<p>As is probably clear, this is a complicated topic, and it seems likely that people are much better at understanding their present personality states in some ways than others. Sun and Vazire’s study was quite ambitious, and it offers a useful path forward for researchers hoping to learn more about an important issue. In the meantime, their general takeaway? “Our findings show that we can probably trust what people say about their momentary levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, and likely neuroticism. However, our findings also call into question people’s awareness of when they are being considerate versus rude.” Useful information – and probably not a surprise to anyone who has dealt with a bullying coworker who doesn’t seem to understand the impression he’s making on his colleagues.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/data2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>As chair of the TERMIS European chapter, what can you tell us about the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society? </strong></p>
<p>With more than 4000 active members worldwide, TERMIS is the most prominent society in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. It values the idea of interdisciplinary collaboration – it is not focused on only biomaterials or cells or surgical procedures, but has a profound translational character. This helps to achieve its main directive: bringing research into clinics so patients can benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong>How are you implementing this translational character in your research projects?</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en">LBI Trauma</a>, we are part of a broad spectrum of projects in the field of regenerative medicine. Among the 90 people working at the institute there are chemists, biochemists, physicians, veterinarians, physicists, biomedical and electrical engineers – it allows us to get a full view on any research question and its possible solutions. As central trauma research organization of the Austrian Workers’ Compensation Board <a href="https://www.auva.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.670957&amp;portal=auvaportal&amp;viewmode=content">AUVA</a> there is a close collaboration with the Austrian trauma clinics. Projects are aimed at current clinical needs – we even look for new research questions by open science approaches –  and new findings find their way into the clinics as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What are your current research highlights?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment we have many novel approaches for scaffold materials. Silk for example, is treated with a new method to deplete its immunoreactive sericin layer but leave the exceptional stability of its fibroin core intake. We use it to form conduits to bridge peripheral nerve defects or as anterior crucial ligament replacement, with excellent results. On the cartilage sector we found a way to make decellularized articular cartilage accessible to cells via laser engraving. The institute also has a strong intensive care research section which is a major player in sepsis research worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about the Springer Reference book series “Tissue Engineering and Regeneration”?</strong></p>

<p>It takes time and effort to write high quality scientific books, and by the time you have them lying on your desk they are practically outdated. This is why I am happy about Springer now offering updateable reference book series that can be accessed online or printed on demand. It fits the fast pace of scientific progress as well as the way we work and look up information in a digital age.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/13441"><em>Tissue Engineering and Regeneration</em></a> Reference Series is designed to be the premier scientific and updatable information source in the field. The books cover the biological basis of tissue regeneration as well as the current state-of-the-art in tissue engineering of specific tissues and organs. Our advisory board contains the Who’s Who of tissue regeneration research and we are always open for new input and collaborations.</p>
<blockquote><p>I always like to quote ‘Art is I, Science is We’</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What role did TERMIS play in creating the books?</strong></p>
<p>It is important for me to highlight that this is a joint project of TERMIS and Springer. The TERMIS community made this project possible by giving valuable scientific contributions and input. Springer kindly agreed to my proposal of making the books freely accessible for TERMIS members, as I felt like we cannot charge them for accessing what is in fact the work of all of us. I always like to quote “Art is I, Science is We”.</p>

Two sets of events for Women in STEM: the theoretical physicist Alessandro Strumia, soon likely ex-CERN affiliated, decried feminist conspiracies and the discrimination against males like himself, in a workshop talk on gender. Right after, the Nobel Prize for physics was finally after 55 years given to a woman. Thing is: one of the other recipients, Gerard Mourou, made it clear in a 2013 video what the roles of males and females in physics are.

The neuroblogging community was quite small then. Neurofuture started in January 2006 <span class="ILfuVd">—</span> a blog about Brain Science and Neurofuturism that was ahead of its time (so to speak): <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://neurofuture.blogspot.com/2006/01/welcome.html" target="_blank">The future is now</a>, in many ways.

They have applications in a broad range of fields, and I'll be aggregating diverse information. Expect a lot of interesting links. I invite your comments.</blockquote><br />In June 2006, she started a video blog, <a href="http://channeln.blogspot.com/" title="Channel N for Neuro - each post spotlights one educational video webcast">Channel N</a>, that shared interesting content related to neuroscience, psychology, and mental health. <a href="https://blogs.psychcentral.com/channeln" title="Psych Central version">Channel N</a> eventually moved to <a href="https://psychcentral.com/">Psych Central</a>, a trusted mega-site for mental health, depression, bipolar, ADHD &amp; psychology information. Sandra also wrote posts for <a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/author/sandra/">World of Psychology</a>, the main PsychCentral blog, including many <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22top+10%22+sandra+site%3Apsychcentral.com%2Fblog%2F&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Top 10 lists</a>, which were always popular. <br /><br />Along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061216132144/scienceblogs.com/omnibrain">Steve Higgins</a>, she blogged for <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/omnibrain/tag/sandra_kiume/">Omni Brain</a> (from <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/omnibrain/tag/sandra_kiume/">December 2006 – January 2008</a>), which was “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070125084417/http:/scienceblogs.com:80/omnibrain/about.php">an exploration of the serious, fun, ridiculous</a> / past, present, future of the brain and the science that loves it” – as part of the long-defunct Science Blogs network. <br /><br /><br />But Sandra’s real love was writing fiction (mostly under the pseudonym S. Kay). She wrote an unpublished novel (or two), flash fiction, and a novella that was published by <a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/">Maudlin House</a> (ironically titled <i><a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/product/joy/">Joy</a></i>). <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_VmwwpT0M/W7GrW_F9WoI/AAAAAAAAMoQ/7Sni9vXwZi8Oxzvu6WfgPjIwA04nguc8gCLcBGAs/s1600/Joy%2Bcover.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="681" data-original-width="453" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_VmwwpT0M/W7GrW_F9WoI/AAAAAAAAMoQ/7Sni9vXwZi8Oxzvu6WfgPjIwA04nguc8gCLcBGAs/s320/Joy%2Bcover.png" width="212" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />The advent of Twitter really changed her writing. She started writing microfiction, ultra-short stories in the form of Tweets (140 characters or less). Sometime they were standalone zaps that told an entire tiny tale.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Epic trance and video mashups, with beer.

<p> The concept of “finding your happy place” just got a big boost thanks to a Max Planck Florida neuroscientist and the NIH Common Fund. Dr. Hyungbae Kwon, Scientific Group Leader at The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience has been awarded a 2018 NIH Director’s Pioneer Award for developing a new light-based technique that allows scientists to visualize and map out how emotions affect neurons. While much focus has been placed on studying neuronal connections within the brain, questions about internal brain state remain unanswered. Neurons convey information like pain or hunger, but how we respond to that information is a function of neuromodulators – a separate entity from neurotransmitters, but a critical part when it comes to facilitating fast information transfer in neuronal network. Dr. Kwon’s lab has created a new light-inducible system, named iTango2, that allows gene expression by both light and neurotransmitters. When applied together, neurons that are activated by neuromodulators can only be labeled when light is illuminated, making it easier for scientists to target neurons that are relevant to selective behaviors. Furthermore, the technology’s ability to activate neurons makes it theoretically possible to control feelings like happiness by shining special lighting on select portions of the brain. This research will add higher degree of understanding in brain functions whose abnormalities are implicated with various types of brain disorders such as ADHD, depression, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Kwon is one of just ten scientists to receive the Pioneer Award in 2018. He will receive $6.8 million over five years for his project entitled ‘Cracking the Neuromodulation Code at Single Cell Resolution.’ The grant is the largest in the eight-year history of Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, and marks the second time a MPFI researcher has been awarded a Pioneer Award.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am honored to receive this recognition and support for this exciting research. For the past decades, remarkable efforts have been made to understand biophysical properties of neurons and wiring diagram of neural circuits in the brain. However, very little is known how internal brain state is regulated and how it affects our sensation, perception and cognition. With this Pioneer Award, I can now begin to dissect fine scale neuromodulation actions in a quantitative manner.” said Dr. Kwon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NIH Director’s Awards are prestigious awards that are given to exceptionally creative scientists proposing high-risk, high-impact research at all career stages. The awards were created to support unconventional approaches to major challenges in biomedical and behavioral research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hyungbae Kwon has been a Research Group Leader for MPFI since July 2012 and heads the research group of Cellular Basis of Neural Circuit Plasticity. Since joining MPFI, Kwon has produced 11 publications, including papers in Science, PNAS, Nature Methods, and Nature Biotechnology in which he is senior author. He has been invited to present his science at numerous international meetings and institutions, and he has established productive collaborations with a number of excellent laboratories, attesting to the high level of interest and respect for his accomplishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Kwon received his Ph.D. in Dr. Pablo Castillo’s lab at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and postdoctoral training with Dr. Bernardo Sabatini at Harvard Medical School. During his postdoctoral period, he used cutting-edge laser-based optics to understand mechanisms of excitatory synapse formation at single synapse resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2012, he began his independent laboratory at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, where he continued to study mechanisms of synapse formation during early brain development and created novel optogenetic approaches that enable to dissect animal sensation, cognition, behaviors at higher precision. Using these newly developed techniques together with other approaches, current research in the Kwon laboratory focuses on understanding principles underlying various forms of cognitive brain actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hyungbae Kwon is an outstanding young investigator whose creativity and productivity leave little doubt that he is at the start of a highly successful independent research career. He is highly deserving of this award and I am extremely proud of his achievements,” said Dr. David Fitzpatrick, MPFI’s CEO and Scientific Director.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Have young people never had it so good, or do they face more challenges than any generation? Our current era in the West is one of high wealth and relatively free of deprivation, meaning minors enjoy material benefits and legal protections that would be the envy of those living in the past. But there is an increasing suspicion that all is not well for our youth, and one of the most popular explanations, among some experts and the popular media, is that excessive “screen time” is to blame (all the attention young people devote to their phones, tablets and laptops). However, this is a contentious theory and such claims have been <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/march-2018/seeing-screen-time-differently">treated sceptically</a> by some scholars based on their reading of the relevant data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-02758-001">study</a> in the journal <i>Emotion</i> has provided another contribution to the debate, uncovering strong evidence that adolescent wellbeing in the USA really is experiencing a decline, and arguing that the most likely culprit is the electronic riches we have given them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34854"></span></p>
<p>The background to this is that from the 1960s into the early 2000s, measures of average wellbeing went up in the US, and this was especially true for younger people. This reflected the fact that these decades saw a climb in general standards of living and avoidance of mass societal traumas like full-scale war or economic deprivation. However, the “screen time” hypothesis, advanced by researchers such as San Diego State University’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">Jean Twenge</a>, is that electronic devices and excessive time spent online may have reversed these trends in recent years, causing problems for young people’s psychological health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To investigate, Twenge and her colleagues Gabrielle Martin and Keith Campbell dived into the “<a href="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org">Monitoring The Future</a>” dataset based on annual surveys of American school students from grades 8 (age 13-14), 10, and 12 that started in 1991. In total, 1.1 million young people answered various questions related to their wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Twenge’s team’s analysis of the answers confirmed the earlier, well-established wellbeing climb, with scores rising across the nineties, and into the later 2000s. This was found across measures like self-esteem, life satisfaction, happiness and satisfaction with individual domains like job, neighbourhood, or friends. But around 2012 these measures started to decline, year on year, up to 2016, the most recent year available. The average effects size of -.14 is typically considered small, but it’s quite something for this to happen over just four years; this is twice as large as the rate of change normally observed between birth cohorts.</p>
<p>Twenge and her colleagues wanted to understand why this change in average wellbeing has occurred, but it’s very hard to demonstrate causes in non-experimental data such as this. In fact, when Twenge previously used the Monitoring the Future data to suggest a screen time effect, sceptical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/nov/14/when-it-comes-to-claims-about-screen-time-we-need-more-sense-and-less-hype">commentators</a> were quick to raise this problem: they argued that her causal-sounding claims rested on correlational data, and that she had not adequately accounted for other potential causal factors (Twenge’s critics also describe her repeated analysis of the same data as a “<a href="https://twitter.com/ShuhBillSkee/status/1047069145731350530">salami slicing</a>” strategy). This time around, Twenge and her team make a point of saying that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that they are not trying to establish causes as such, but that they are assessing the plausibility of potential causes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>First, they explain that if a given variable is playing a causal role in affecting wellbeing, then we should expect any change in that variable to correlate with the observed changes in wellbeing – if not, it isn’t plausible that the variable is a causal factor. So the researchers looked at time spent in a number of activities that could plausibly be driving the wellbeing decline. Less sport, and fewer meetings with peers correlated with lower wellbeing, as did less time reading print media (newspapers) and, surprisingly, less time doing homework (this last finding would appear to scotch another popular hypothesis that it is our harrying of students with assignments that is causing all the problems). Additionally, more TV watching and more electronic communication both correlated with lower wellbeing. All these effects held true for measures of happiness, life satisfaction and self-esteem, with the effects stronger in the 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>-graders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, Twenge’s team dug a little deeper into the data on screen-time. They found that adolescents who spent a very small amount of time on digital devices – a couple of hours – had the highest wellbeing, even more than those who never used them. However, higher doses of screen-time were clearly associated with lower happiness – those spending 10-19 hours per week on their devices were 41 per cent more likely to be unhappy than lower-frequency users, and those who used them 40 hours a week or more (one in ten of teenagers) were twice as likely to be unhappy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data was slightly complicated by the fact that there was a tendency for kids who were social in the real world to also use more online communication, but by bracketing out different cases it became clear that the real-world sociality component correlated with greater wellbeing, whereas greater time on screens or online only correlated with poorer wellbeing.</p>
<p>So far, so plausible. But the next question is, are the drops in average wellbeing happening in tandem with trends toward increased electronic device usage? Superficially, it looks like it – after all, 2012 was the tipping point when more than half of Americans began owning smartphones. Twenge and her colleagues dug deeper and also found that across the key years of 2013-16, wellbeing was indeed lowest in years where adolescents spent more time online, on social media, and reading news online, and when more youth in the US had smartphones. And in a second analysis, they found that where technology went, dips in wellbeing followed: for instance, years with a larger increase in online usage were followed by years with lower wellbeing, rather than vice versa. This doesn’t prove causality, but is consistent with it. Meanwhile, TV use didn’t show this tracking – TV might make you less happy, but this isn’t what seems to be driving the recent declines in young people’s average happiness.</p>
<p>A similar but reversed pattern was found for the activities positively associated with wellbeing – for example, years where people spent more time with friends were better years for wellbeing (and followed by better years). Sadly, the data also showed face-to-face socialising and sports activity had declined over the period covered by the survey.</p>
<p>There is another explanation waiting in the wings that Twenge and her colleagues wanted to address: the impact of the great recession of 2007-2009, which hit a great number of American families and could potentially be affecting adolescents through instability for the family. The dataset didn’t include economic data, so instead the researchers looked at whether the 2013-16 wellbeing slump was tracking economic indicators. They found some evidence that some crude measures, like income inequality, correlated with changes in wellbeing, but economic measures with a more direct impact, like median family income and unemployment rates (which put families into difficulties), had no relationship with wellbeing. The researchers also note that the recession hit some years before we see the beginning of the wellbeing drop, and before the steepest wellbeing decline, which occurred in 2013.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that “electronic communication was the only adolescent activity negatively correlated with psychological wellbeing that increased at the same time psychological well-being declined.” This isn’t bullet-proof evidence to be sure, and I suspect that sceptical figures in the field will be keen to address alternative explanations – such as unassessed variables playing a role. But the new work does go further than before and suggests that screen time should still be considered a potential impediment to young people’s flourishing.</p>

<h4>No, it’s not a metaphor</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M1rq931Ga7LIoGLyUTQyHQ.jpeg" />One of three silly brain as computer images to come</figure><p>Neuroscience is a funny discipline which can demand a level of interdisciplinary knowledge that is hard to achieve. At its heart, neuroscience is concerned with understanding the organ that is responsible for generating our behaviour, and thus, it is a branch of physiology and psychology. At the same time, most neuroscientists will have heard, or even used, the words “calculate”, “algorithm”, and “computation” many times in their professional lives. I think there’s a good reason for this: <strong>the brain is a computer</strong>, and neuroscience is also branch of computer science, in my opinion. However, many neuroscientists do not see it that way.</p><p>In online discussions I have often read the phrase “<a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/1999/00000006/f0020011/994">The Brain as a Computer Metaphor</a>”. The implication of this phrase is clear: the brain is <strong>not</strong> a computer, and at best, we can use computers as a metaphor to understand the brain. (At worst,<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer"> the “metaphor” does not hold and should be abandoned</a>.) Similarly, I have heard neuroscientists say things like, “<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">neural circuits don’t truly run algorithms</a>”. Again, the conclusion is clear: the brain doesn’t run any algorithms in reality, so our constant use of the words “algorithm” and “computer” when talking about the brain is misguided.</p><p>Unfortunately, what these discussions demonstrate is that many researchers do not, as a rule, actually understand the formal definitions of “computer” or “algorithm” as provided by computer science. (Or alternatively, if they do understand them, they don’t accept them for some reason.) If you understand the formal definitions of computer and algorithm as given by computer science, then you know that the brain is very clearly a computer running algorithms, almost trivially so.</p><p>My goal in this article is to provide a brief, intuitive explanation for those formal definitions of “computer” and “algorithm”, one pitched at neuroscientists. My hope is that this will help neuroscientists to move away from these confused, misleading discussions about whether or not a computer (the brain) is actually a computer, because as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/opinion/sunday/face-it-your-brain-is-a-computer.html">others have noted</a>, it most certainly is.</p><p>I want to make clear that my goal here is <em>not</em> to engage with the much larger, more complicated discussions in cognitive science and philosophy of mind as to whether we can <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/">understand mentation using computational frameworks</a>. I consider that to be a separate question regarding the nature of the mind, and there, the discussions get much more complicated. I personally think that computer science has a lot to contribute to neuroscience (indeed, as I said above, I consider neuroscience to be a branch of computer science), and I happen to think computational frameworks can explain mental activity, but that’s not my target here. Here, I seek only to articulate why, if we ignore questions regarding the nature of the mind, then according to first principles and formal definitions, the brain necessarily is a computer, and there really is no discussion to be had once you understand and accept the definitions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6X5Jik3k_Zj7gfkJIHY9yg.jpeg" />A high-school student implementing an algorithm</figure><h4>Defining an <em>algorithm</em></h4><p>Okay, what is an “algorithm” and what is a “computer”? The formal definitions for these words originate in the work of mathematicians in the early half of the 20th century. Back then, many mathematicians were concerned with some questions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> had put forward in a very famous lecture he delivered in 1900 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">23 Mathematical Problems to be Solved in the Next Century</a>.</p><p>One of those problems, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">10th problem</a>”, was concerned with determining whether a polynomial (e.g. 6x³yz⁴ + 4y²z + z - 9) had roots made up solely of integers (e.g. x = 5, y = -3, z = 0, etc.). Hilbert wanted mathematicians to develop an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method">effective method</a>, a “recipe”, for deciding whether this was the case for any arbitrary polynomial. Such a recipe is, colloquially, what we call an “algorithm”. <em>That’s the intuitive definition of algorithm</em>: an algorithm is a finite set of instructions that can be followed mechanically, with no insight required, in order to give some specific output (e.g. an answer to yes/no integer roots) for a specific input (e.g. a specific polynomial like 6x³yz⁴ + 4y²z + z — 9). To put this into context, what was desired at this point in history was a way to specify how any human being could sit down at a desk with a paper and pencil and work out the answer to something without having to actually generate any novel insight. So, for example, long division provides an algorithm for calculating the result of dividing one number by another — you can just sit there with a paper and pencil and follow the finite set of instructions like an automaton, and you will arrive at the correct result. Hilbert assumed there must be an algorithm for the particular task of polynomial integral roots, and the job for mathematicians was simply to find it.</p><p>As luck would have it, Hilbert had stumbled onto a very deep problem. Mathematicians took on his challenge, but they had a hard time coming up with a recipe. More and more, various mathematicians began to ask whether some problems in mathematics, including Hilbert’s “10th problem” were, in fact, <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/sampler.pdf">not <em>decidable</em></a>, meaning there was no algorithm for solving them. Of course, mathematicians being mathematicians, they desired proofs that an algorithm didn’t exist for these problems. The issue was that with only an informal, intuitive definition of the word “algorithm”, proving that <strong><em>no</em></strong> algorithm existed for a given problem was basically impossible.</p><p>Given this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> set about to develop a formal definition for algorithms. The two researchers worked independently, and came to different solutions, but their solutions turned out to be mathematically equivalent. Church invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, and defined an algorithm as anything that could be done with lambda calculus. Turing invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, and defined an algorithm as anything that could be done with Turing machines. I will leave it to the reader to learn more about the specific definitions of <a href="https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">lambda calculus</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/turing.pdf">Turing machines</a>, but it is important to understand that both are simply a <em>mathematical tool</em>. This is fairly obvious with lambda calculus, but often people get confused about Turing machines because of the word “machine” — confusingly, <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. Indeed, the definition assumes some very unrealistic components (like an infinite tape). It is important to think of Turing machines as just a mathematical tool. I draw attention to this because I will return to it when we discuss the relationship between Turing machines and brains.</p><p>As mentioned, it turned out that Church and Turing’s definitions were equivalent, meaning that anything which you could do with lambda calculus you could do with a Turing machine. As time has gone on, empirical experience has suggested that any attempt to formalize the intuitive definition of algorithm will settle on something that is equivalent to Turing machines. Therefore, most computer scientists today accept something known as the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/">Church-Turing thesis</a>:</p><blockquote><strong>The Church-Turing thesis:</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Any algorithm can be implemented by a Turing machine.</blockquote><p>It should be recognized that this statement can actually be viewed as either a <em>definition</em>,<em> </em>or a <em>hypothesis</em>. If we view it as a hypothesis, then the Church-Turing thesis hypothesizes that any problem we have a means of solving using only a finite set of instructions and no insight, will turn out to be implementable by a Turing machine, i.e. it hypothesizes that our intuitive definition is covered by Turing’s definition (see e.g. <a href="https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Book/Introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation_third%20edition%20-%20Michael%20Sipser.pdf">page 183 here</a>). That leaves open the possibility that someday the Church-Turing thesis will be violated. However, Church and Turing were seeking to formalize the concept of “algorithm”. Moreover, the Church-Turing thesis is generally taken as a given by researchers, so when people seek a proof that there is no algorithm for some function, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/comp.pdf">they sometimes do so by proving that you can’t do it with a Turing machine</a>. Therefore, it is safe to say that it has become a definition in computer science, meaning that the formal definition of algorithm is given by the Church-Turing thesis:</p><blockquote><strong>The Church-Turing thesis (as definition):</strong></blockquote><blockquote>An algorithm is anything that a Turing machine can do.</blockquote><p>With the definition of algorithm in hand, we can now define “computable functions” and “computer”. A “computable function” is defined as any task that can be solved using an algorithm. A “computer” is then defined as any physical machinery that can solve computable functions via algorithms. If we think back to the use of the word “computer” at this point in history, this makes sense. “Computers” at this time were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer">people</a> whose job was to sit down with pencil and paper and use an algorithm to solve computable functions (e.g. to integrate some equation). Clearly, these people were computers according to this definition, because they were providing solutions to computable functions via algorithms.</p><p>Importantly, there are many processes that consist of a finite set of instructions, but not discrete, step-by-step instructions, and which can still be done with a Turing machine. This is where things get confusing. Consider, for example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording">analog audio system</a>. Many people mistakenly think that Turing machines cannot implement analog functions because they are not defined by a discrete set of step-by-step values. But remember, <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. They’re abstract mathematical constructs that can operate with infinite memory and no time restrictions (any finite amount of time counts, no matter how large). As such, an analog system can be implemented by a Turing machine to any desired level of precision. That’s why we consider all of the functions that audio systems perform to be computable functions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live">and why we can simulate them well</a>). Of course, it must be recognized that if we require infinite precision for an analog function, then it isn’t computable, but that is rarely a situation we are faced with practically.</p><p>Indeed, any procedure for solving a computable function can be implemented by a Turing machine, <em>by definition</em>, no matter the specific mechanism involved. Part of the reason a lot of confusion sets in, even amongst <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">really smart people</a>, is that when you study Turing machines and computable functions in school as a computer science student, the concern is rarely with analog, or stochastic, or distributed processes. <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Example after example are deterministic step-by-step algorithms that are easy to teach with</a>. That’s good for learning the basics, but it leads many people to mistakenly think that any system which isn’t clearly a step-by-step, discrete system can’t be running algorithms, and that’s simply not true.</p><p>That’s not to say that Turing machines can do everything. For example, it has been proven mathematically that there are some problems that Turing machines can’t do, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem#History">like Hilbert’s 10th problem</a>. But the reason a Turing machine cannot do some things is not because those things are analog, or stochastic, or distributed, etc. It’s because there are certain limits to mechanical, axiomatic methods — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">some questions simply have no concrete answer within mathematics as we know it</a>.</p><p>To summarize the formal definitions: <br />(1) an algorithm is anything a Turing machine can do,<br />(2) computable functions are defined as those functions that we have algorithms for,<br />(3) a computer is anything which physically implements algorithms in order to solve computable functions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A9sd70XUUthRhWxirJza9Q.jpeg" />Nature implementing some computable functions</figure><h4>Is everything a computer?</h4><p>Given these definitions, is the brain a computer? Most certainly, because our brains implement various algorithms to solve computable functions, ranging from the obviously computable (you can mentally sort a list, pick which of two numbers is larger, multiply two numbers, etc.) to the less obviously, but still, computable (you can run, talk, play music, etc.). However, a big issue with this approach, and more broadly with the definitions provided above, is that they can be applied to almost <em>anything</em>. For example, the macroscopic laws of physics are computable functions (e.g. a parabolic path is computable). Therefore, technically, every object in the universe, every planet, every rock, every feather, every snowflake, every grain of sand, etc., can be viewed as a computer, implementing algorithms to solve the functions that describe that object’s evolution through time. That would appear to render the definitions above so broad as to be useless.</p><p>In my opinion (and as a subscriber to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54889e73e4b0a2c1f9891289/t/564b61a4e4b04eca59c4d232/1447780772744/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf">Wittgenstein’s later philosophies</a>), the way to contend with this problem is to examine our usage of the word “computer”. What do we usually use this word for, and how do computer scientists use this word? Can we generate some mapping between the two that renders our usage non-trivial? Obviously, we are all comfortable with calling the machines we now carry in our pockets and keep on our desks “computers”. That’s how we usually use the word, e.g. when we get a new laptop we say “I just bought a new computer”, rather than, “I just bought a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann architecture programmable machine</a>” (which is a reasonable description of what they are). And it’s not just the average person: computer scientists also use the word “computer” to refer to these machines. So, what is it about these machines that makes this usage less trivial than, say, calling every grain of sand a “computer”? Is this usage actually grounded in a scientific, formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)">language game</a>, or is it just a funny quirk of our everyday, non-scientific language games?</p><p>There are very good, formal reasons to use the word “computer” when referring to our laptops and phones. One of the things that Turing proved was that some Turing machines could be used to implement <em>any</em> other Turing machine. These are called <strong>universal Turing machines</strong>. Now, remember, <em>Turing machines are not actually machines</em>, they’re a formalism, a mathematical tool. A universal Turing machine is a mathematical tool that can be used to perform the functions of any other mathematical tool that is also a Turing machine. Moreover, a mathematical tool that can be proven to be capable of implementing any algorithm is called “<strong>Turing complete</strong>”. For example, the programming languages familiar to us all (C++, Python, etc.) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-Turing-complete-languages-and-which-programming-languages-comes-under-this">are Turing complete</a>, because it can be <em>proven</em> that any algorithm can be programmed with these languages.</p><p>Given this, we can see why the machines we apply the word “computer” to deserve their name. These machines provide a physical substrate for running algorithms using Turing complete programming languages. This means that, with the right programming, they can solve any computable function for us. (Note: this does not provide a practical guarantee, e.g. it may take billions or trillions of years for any given function to run in any given language. The question of practical computation is addressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">computational complexity theory</a>.) As such, these machines that are now ubiquitous in our lives are a much more powerful form of computer than a stone or a snowflake, which are limited to computing only the functions of physics that apply to their movement. Your laptop is an “uber-computer”, as it were, and therefore, arguably deserves the title “computer” much more than any other object in your house (except maybe you).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SS4mn4-psfnt07dBbpV2xw.jpeg" />A squishy computer</figure><h4>What about brains then?</h4><p>What does all this business about Turing completeness have to do with brains? As many people have noted, the internal workings of brains are nothing like the internal workings of the Von Neumann architecture machines that we usually call computers. So, surely brains aren’t computers, right? Well, no, brains are also “uber-computers”, they just work in a different manner.</p><p>First, we can consider the anecdotal evidence. Consider all the functions that an adult human with sufficient education is capable of implementing. It’s a pretty big list! In fact, with no more than a pencil and piece of paper, any human is arguably capable of running any program that has been programmed in a language like Python. Even without a pencil and paper, you can implement a huge swathe of functions that well outstrips the functions that a stone, a chair or a thermometer, say, can implement.</p><p>Second, we can consider the formal evidence. Computer scientists have demonstrated that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089360809190009T">multilayer</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000085710136">recurrent</a> artificial neural networks are Turing complete, meaning you can implement any algorithm with them<em>.</em> That’s one of the reasons why we can do all sorts of impressive stuff with neural networks! This doesn’t mean that any given neural network can compute any function, though. Rather, it means that for any given function there exists a neural network that can compute it.</p><p>Put another way, we can think of neural networks as a sort of programming language: the synaptic connections in a neural network define the functions that they implement, so the set of all possible neural network architectures is effectively a programming language, and this language is Turing complete. Although there are many differences between artificial neural networks and brains, arguably those differences only render real brains <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303001491"><strong>more</strong></a> computationally powerful than artificial neural networks. This means that when we consider the set of all <em>possible</em> brains, then for any given computable function, there is probably a hypothetical brain that can solve it. Thus, the “language of brains”, as it were, is probably Turing complete.</p><p>Moreover, we can make some stronger statements about individual animals, including of course, humans. Our brains have roughly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11418939">10¹⁴</a> synapses, and there is a surprising amount of flexibility in how those synapses are set. This means that we can implement many, many different functions. Is any individual human Turing complete, then, i.e. can we implement the entire set of computable functions? Probably, if we were immortal, but practically, no. However, the same caveat applies to our laptops and phones. The languages they can be programmed with are Turing complete, but like us, they would require immortality to guarantee that they could implement any computable function. Thus, the set of functions that we can implement as humans is not radically different in scope than the set of functions that our trusty old Von Neumann architecture machines can implement.</p><p>Of course, not all animals are as flexible as humans. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2612">I worked</a> for many years with the toad species <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/species/5255"><em>Xenopus laevis</em></a>, and I can tell you, they’re much more limited in their behavioural repertoire than humans. Nonetheless, they can still do a <em>hell</em> of a lot more than a stone. Any animal can, thanks to their brains. Rodents can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3736">replicate spatial probability distributions in their searches</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(14)01107-6">optimize their strategies in oppositional games</a>. <a href="https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/12572/elife-12572-v2.pdf"><em>C. elegans</em> implement a Markov model in their search behaviour</a>. Because these functions are computable (e.g. solvable with a Turing machine) we can say these animals are running algorithms.</p><p>For example, one of the most appropriate uses of the word “algorithm” in recent neuroscience work came from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23014">Ortezia et al</a>. They demonstrated that zebrafish embryos use the following recipe for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheotaxis">rheotaxis</a>:</p><ul><li>Determine the change in the gradient of water flow.</li><li>If the gradient decreases, swim straight.</li><li>If the gradient increases, turn in the direction of flow field rotation.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gjD6mrvKg6z7KOiThnvQRg.jpeg" />A computer for swimming upstream</figure><p>That’s an algorithm, both intuitively and formally. It’s a finite set of instructions to solve a given function, and it can be implemented with a Turing machine. Of course, the zebrafish probably isn’t engaged in a step-by-step program that looks anything like a computer program on your laptop. It must be using analog sensors, an array of neurons with fluctuating voltages, stochastic transmitter release, etc. Nonetheless, Ortezia et al. are right, the zebrafish is using an <em>algorithm</em> to solve this ecologically relevant problem. That makes the zebrafish embryo’s nervous system a computer.</p><p>Hence, when we consider both the formal definitions and the common usage of the word “computer”, it is perfectly reasonable to say that the brain is a computer. Any brain is a sophisticated device capable of implementing a very large set of algorithms to solve many different computable functions. It should be noted that where we draw the line is unclear, e.g. is a single cell a computer? What about DNA? Both can implement more functions than a rock. We have to accept that there is a subjective decision to be made in these borderline cases. The definitions do not say how many algorithms a machine needs to implement to be a computer. But, given that the set of neural networks is Turing complete (and therefore also probably the set of possible brains), it is pretty clear that brains deserve the title “computer”. Therefore, the brain is a computer.</p><p>It’s not a metaphor, it’s not an analogy, it’s a fact.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pScJ0PZQBtgF6p9OGQLzGQ.jpeg" />A second hilarious brain as computer image available for download</figure><h3>Objections to the “brain is a computer” argument</h3><p>When I’ve advanced this argument in public, I’ve encountered a number of objections, some very strong and worth considering, others indicating a basic misunderstanding of the logic. I’ll try to briefly contend with the common objections I’ve encountered here, moving from objections founded on misunderstanding to valid objections that need to be contended with:</p><h4>Objection 1. Brains are nothing like Turing machines (or laptops), therefore they’re not computers</h4><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer">This objection</a> is borne of a misunderstanding of the definitions above. Nothing in the definition of “algorithm”, “computable function”, or “computer” states that computers must be like Turing machines or Von Neumann architecture machines. A computer need not operate with binary codes, it doesn’t need to use discrete-time processes, it doesn’t need registers or memory banks, or step-by-step instructions — it doesn’t need to be remotely like our laptops of phones for the definitions to apply.</p><p>The definitions simply say that algorithms are things that you can do with a Turing machine, and computers are things that run algorithms. Importantly, those definitions do not state any practical limits on how a Turing machine could do it. So, for example, if you have an algorithm that uses analog, continuous processes (like the zebrafish algorithm for swimming upstream probably does), then the Turing machine corresponding to it will have to run for potentially very long in order to approximate that analog process to sufficient precision. But, Turing machines aren’t real machines! They’re mathematical constructs, so there’s no problem with this. Nothing in the definition of “algorithm” says that it must be economical to implement an algorithm with a Turing machine. As long as you are solving computable functions, you’ve got yourself a computer running algorithms. Thus, it doesn’t matter that the brain is nothing like a Turing machine (nothing is, really) or nothing like your laptop. Yes, the brain is a jumble of cells using voltages, neurotransmitters, distributed representations, etc. Yes, it has no programmer, and yes it is shaped by evolution and life experience. None of that matters. As long as we don’t require infinite precision in our description of neural processes (and I see no reason to think we would), then the brain is a computer running algorithms, according to the definitions provided by the Church-Turing thesis.</p><h4>Objection 2. Just because you can simulate the brain with a Turing machine doesn’t make the brain a computer</h4><p>This objection is related to the first objection, in that it stems from a failure to understand the definitions and the role of Turing machines in those definitions. The thrust of this objection is that even though we can run a Turing machine for as long as we want in order to implement analog processes, we’re really just <em>simulating</em> those processes with a Turing machine, so we cannot say that they count as something a Turing machine can do. Thus, Turing machine can’t actually do what brains do, so brains aren’t running algorithms.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the point that must be returned to here is that <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. We don’t simulate <em>anything</em> with Turing machines, just as we don’t “simulate” things with lambda calculus. We use Turing machines to mathematically determine whether a particular process counts as an algorithm or not. Therefore, if we can demonstrate mathematically that a given analog process can be implemented by a Turing machine to any arbitrary degree of precision, then we have demonstrated that we have an algorithm. Yes, we simulate many things, including brains, with our Von Neumann machines. But, <em>Von Neumann machines are not Turing machines</em>. It’s important to remember this, because many people fall into the trap of thinking that computers are defined as Turing machines, when they most certainly are not. No physical object is a Turing machine, just as no physical object is an algebra.</p><h4>Objection 3. Computers cannot explain the mind, therefore the brain is not a computer</h4><p>This one is tough because it is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/">thorny philosophical argument</a>, and how one reacts to it depends on one’s philosophical stances. Many philosophers have argued that purely mechanical accounts of the brain cannot account for the mind, and given that the definition of computer provided above is very much mechanical, it is true that if the mind cannot be accounted for by purely mechanical means, then there must be something missing when I say “the brain is a computer”.</p><p>Ultimately, as I noted in the introduction, I do not have time to contend with the long debates on this issue in philosophy of mind and cognitive science here. All I will say, is that I <em>personally</em> find all of the philosophical objections to the idea that the mind can arise from mechanical processes unconvincing. Whether it’s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">Searle’s Chinese Room Argument</a>, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/">Chalmer’s zombies</a>, or <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/#2">Jackson’s Mary the Scientist</a>, I’ve never been persuaded that there’s anything really worthy of serious consideration for neuroscientists in these thought experiments. I’m much more convinced by the works of philosophers like <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661">Daniel Dennett</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Neurophilosophy-Toward-Unified-Science-Mind-Brain/dp/0262530856">Patricia Churchland</a>, who seem much more clear-eyed and logical to me. But hey, that’s my perspective. If someone rejects the idea that the mind can be reduced to physical mechanism, then I recognize that my arguments above are unconvincing. But, anyone who is comfortable with reductionism, and who understands the definitions above, should also recognize that the brain is a computer by definition.</p><h4>Objection 4. Brains can implement non-computable functions, therefore the brain is not a computer</h4><p>This is a very interesting argument that has been advanced by various people. The physicist <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0192861980">Roger Penrose</a> has claimed that humans have various insights and behaviours that require non-Turing computation and quantum effects for explanation. <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/penrose.htm">Like Dennett</a>, I consider Penrose’s claims questionable. It’s not clear from scientific evidence that human behaviour requires any radical rethinking of computation or physiology.</p><p>But, there are other more serious attempts in this vein. Notably, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hava_Siegelmann">Hava Siegelmann</a>, who provided one of the proofs that recurrent neural networks are Turing complete, also published an <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/268/5210/545">article in Science</a> in which she argued that recurrent neural networks can, in fact, be <strong>super Turing</strong>. This means that they can solve the set of computable functions (as defined by Turing machines) and <em>more, </em>i.e. they can implement algorithms that Turing machines cannot. It’s a very interesting result. I will admit that I find Siegelmann’s proof in that paper hard to understand, so I prefer to remain agnostic as to whether this is an accepted fact. (I will note though, that if Sigelmann’s proof is valid, it calls for a revision of the Church Turing thesis, so I wonder why computer science has not apparently taken this leap.)</p><p>But, for argument’s sake, let’s say that Siegelmann’s proof is correct, and that recurrent neural networks are super Turing. That would suggest that brains are also super Turing. If the space of possible brains is super Turing, then someone, someday, could engage in computations that no laptop could ever do. In that case, arguably, the brain is not just a computer, it’s a <em>super computer</em>. This would only make my case that the brain is a computer stronger.</p><h4>Objection 5. The brain has many constraints placed on it by evolution that would prevent it from being Turing complete</h4><p>This objection raises some important points. Certainly, we know that evolution can take odd paths to get to certain physiological functions, and brains are likely no exception. Moreover, brains face major energy constraints, both spatial and temporal, and memory capabilities limited by the size of our mnemonic networks. Thus, the chances that the entire set of computable functions could be implemented by any real brain are zero.</p><p>All of this is true, but it fails to recognize that many of the same things could be said about our trusty Von Neumann machines. Though we seem to have little concern for our energy usage as a species, the reality is that we cannot devote infinite energy to our digital computers. Moreover, although the cloud is growing rapidly, we still don’t have infinite memory capabilities (at least, not us mere mortals who don’t run big tech companies). As such, your laptop also has many functions that it cannot calculate for you given reasonable energy and memory constraints. That doesn’t stop you from calling your laptop a “computer”, because it is still an incredibly powerful machine for solving computable functions with algorithms, just like our brains.</p><p>Of course, the energetic and evolutionary constraints that impinge on brains are very different from the constraints on our Von Neumann machines, and that is also important. As we compile the principles of <em>neural</em> computation in the coming century, some of those principles will surely have to do with the unique constraints that brains face. But, that doesn’t render brains non-computers, it makes them a special kind of computer, one shaped by evolution.</p><h4>Objection 6. These definitions are useless and potentially misleading</h4><p>This objection is potentially valid. As I noted, the technical definitions of “computer” and “algorithm” are so abstract that they can be applied to everything in the universe. As I argued above, I think it’s reasonable to restrict their usage to machines, like the brain, that not only solve the functions of physics, but a much larger array of computable functions, potentially even all of them (assuming the space of possible brains is Turing complete). But, what do we achieve by applying the words “computer” and “algorithm” to the brain? How does that help us to understand the brain, given that the formal definitions are mechanism agnostic? If many people do not know these formal definitions, and they think that “computers” are Von Neumann architecture machines and “algorithms” are discrete step-by-step instructions for Von Neumann architecture machines, then we run the risk of grossly misleading these people when we use these words in relation to the brain. My response to this objection is twofold.</p><p>First, there are many terms that scientists use formal definitions for, but which many people misuse. For example, the term “significant” means something very specific in statistical hypothesis testing, even though its usage in common language means anything that’s “big”, “meaningful”, or “impactful”. Should we stop using the term “significant”, then? I don’t think so. I think we merely need to be careful to articulate clearly to people what we mean when we use this word.</p><p>I think it’s the same with “computer” and “algorithm”. When we use these words, we need to be clear what definitions we’re operating with. If speaking to the lay public, that means highlighting the fact that the brain is not a computer that is anything like their laptops or phones, lest they think otherwise. If speaking to other scientists, it means articulating clearly the formal definitions and asserting only that the brain implements a large array of algorithms to solve many different computable functions.</p><p>Second, I think we actually gain something when we say the brain is a computer. There is a rich vein of theories in computer science that are mechanism agnostic, including computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. When we note that the brain is a computer, we are highlighting that these theories are applicable to the brain — which they are! Neuroscientists can, and do, examine how the brain implements various algorithms, how it deals with computationally intractable functions, and how it does things like store, compress or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005497">transmit information</a>. All of this scientific activity is useful, and it derives from our understanding that the brain is a computer.</p><p>The desire to reject the statement “the brain is a computer” out of fear that it misleads those of us who don’t quite understand or know the definitions is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Can we not simply work hard at being precise and transparent in our definitions? Need we reject a true statement that feeds various streams of scientific inquiry simply because some people don’t actually understand what it means? This seems overly myopic and pessimistic to me. I think neuroscientists can, and should, use the formal definitions of “algorithm” and “computer” provided by computer science, and simply be careful not to overstate what those words imply.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*np9V6bGTJcQ7DpiO6ogbAQ.jpeg" />One last ridiculous brain as computer image for the road…</figure><h3>I shouldn’t count my computers before they halt…</h3><p>That last argument, that it’s useful to say the “brain is a computer”, is really the key one. For example, if in the distant future of neuroscience it turns out that information theory provides little in the way of helpful insight, then maybe using these abstract definitions and applying them to the brain has been a silly waste of time. Maybe I’ve just been wasting my glucose on banging out this argument. We know the brain works nothing like our laptops or phones, so maybe all I’ve ever done is confuse more people than I’ve helped with this argument.</p><p>Obviously, my bet is that this will turn out to be important for understanding the brain. Indeed, as I stated in the introduction, I think that neuroscience is just as much a branch of computer science as it is of physiology and psychology. I am one of a number of researchers who <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305093">view artificial intelligence and neuroscience as intimately related</a>, and who consider artificial intelligence as key to theoretical inquiry in neuroscience. Perhaps people like me who think this way are just part of a trend that has grown into a bubble due to hype in machine learning. Perhaps… but this line of thinking certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">predates</a> today’s hype in artificial intelligence. Whether it will be important to recognize that the brain is a computer according to the definitions of computer science is something that we cannot fully grok at this moment in history.

<p>One eyewitness to a robbery reports that the culprit was a male in his 40s with brown hair, wearing a light-coloured T-shirt. Another describes a blond man in his early 30s wearing a denim shirt. If you’re a police officer investigating the crime, whose memory do you trust?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Identifying which of two apparently credible but conflicting eye-witness statements to trust is a big problem for law enforcement agencies (as is deciding, in the case of a witness who has no incentive to lie, which among their memories are accurate). Now a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xap0000175">new paper</a>, reported in the<i> Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, provides initial evidence for a new, objectively verifiable method for doing this. This work has, as the researchers write, “potentially far-reaching significance, not the least in the legal context.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34816"></span></p>
<p>Torun Lindholm at Stockholm University and her fellow researchers report two studies. For the first, they recruited 34 men, who separately watched a video of a staged abduction of a woman by two men. Afterwards, the men, who were interviewed separately, were first asked to recall all they could about the crime, then they were given 12 specific prompts – to describe the clothing of the men who waited outside the victim’s house, for instance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These interviews were recorded, and raters later identified and pooled all the “accurate” and “inaccurate” responses. Next, two more raters then coded each of these individual responses, this time looking for cues that indicated how hard the participant had to work to produce their response (so-called “effort cues”). These included pauses in speech; filler non-words (like “um” or “uh”); filler words (like “you know” or “well”); and hedges (words that reduced the force of an assertion, such as “maybe” or “I guess”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier work has found that correct memories are recalled faster than incorrect memories, which led the researchers to suspect that signs of slow, more effortful recall – like the use of lots of filler words – might indicate that a memory was faulty. As expected, the analysis showed that inaccurate responses included significantly more hedges and filler non-words and words than accurate responses. This result raises the possibility that these cues could in future be used to differentiate accurate from mistaken memories in an objective way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A second study on 10 men and 10 women mostly replicated these findings, but also found that, for this group, delays while reporting a memory – another effort cue – were associated with inaccuracy. (This study also found that asking a participant how confident they were in the accuracy of a particular memory provided no additionally useful information, on top of the hedge, delay and filler data.)</p>
<p>These studies do have some limitations. The number of participants was small. And they were interviewed immediately after viewing the events they were asked to describe, which would rarely happen in real life eye-witness situations. Might delays in interviewing make it harder to use effort cues to predict statement accuracy? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Also, while use of a greater use of filler words and hedges was strongly associated with inaccuracy, that doesn’t mean that participants reporting accurate memories never used them. Will the total number of effort cues observed in a witness’s testimony allow police officers easily to distinguish between accurate and faulty memories? As yet, no one knows. Still, this work does reveal some objectively verifiable markers, and that’s an important first step. As the researchers point out, “Given research showing that most people have vast difficulties in judging the quality of others’ memories, combined with the scarcity of research on genuinely reported memories, these initial findings suggest unexplored alternatives that may prove highly useful for improving accuracy judgements.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/ramon_y_cajal_conexiones-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Even though it’s smaller than a basketball, the scale of the human brain can feel astronomical. “There are as many neurons in the human brain as there are stars (100 billion) in the Milky Way” is commonly stated in musings on the brain. And while this figure isn’t quite accurate (it’s closer to 86 billion neurons/brain), the comparison is staggering.<sup>1</sup> Neurons, though, aren’t useful without synapses – the point of contact between neurons where chemical messages are conveyed. It’s at synapses where memories are formed and skills like dribbling a basketball are honed. And it’s at the level of the synapse where the human brain scales up to numbers that dwarf our tiny galaxy – 100 trillion synapses is the crude estimate. Any effort to catalog and characterize the brain’s population of synapses probably sounds as futile as cataloging all the stars in the universe. A new field called synaptomics, however, has emerged to try and do just that: map the molecular composition and spatial distribution of every single synapse in the brain.</p>
<p>The scale of synapses is so staggering, there actually isn’t a consensus on how many there are. The number <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/100-trillion-connections/">100 trillion</a> appears in popular articles and <a href="http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43512#_edn4">teaching tools</a>, but it’s not typically referenced in peer-reviewed journals. 100 trillion is calculated by multiplying 100 billion neurons by 1,000 connections each, which belies the diversity in neuronal shape and size.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19644"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1.png"><img alt="A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses." class="wp-image-19644" height="438" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1-300x211.png" width="622" /></a><em>A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses.</em></figure>
<p>Neurons, like “E” in the figure above, may only form a dozen synapses on its simple dendritic arbor. A neuron with a dense network of dendrites, like in “B” or “F”, above, may form 10,000 to 100,000 synapses. With 86 billion neurons spread through roughly 200 unique regions<sup>2</sup> – each region containing unique combinations of neuron types – accurate estimation becomes close to impossible. This is not to say that finding the precise number of synapses in a human brain is the most pressing question in neuroscience. But framing this question does show how difficult it is to answer even the most basic questions at this scale. In other words, if figuring out the number of synapses isn’t feasible, how does the field begin to answer more complex questions about the brain’s catalog of synapses?</p>
<p>The approach most neuroscientists take is to compartmentalize. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time, according to proverb. Neuroscientists take their fork and steak knife and start sawing away at one brain region or circuit and learn the rules that govern the set of synapses there. For example, there have been over 11,500 Pubmed cataloged publications on “hippocampal plasticity” – studies that furthered our understanding of synapses in this memory-formation region. But how do the synapses in this region compare to the rest of the brain? Will it take another 2.3 million bites (11,500 x 200 brain regions) of elephant meat to figure this out?</p>
<p>A group led by Seth Grant at University of Edinburgh is attempting to define some simple principles that distinguish and group the brain’s trillions (?) of synapses, in an effort they call the <em><a href="http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org/">Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping</a></em> pipeline or, more simply, synaptomics. They started with the mouse brain in a recent issue of <em><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30581-6">Neuron</a>.</em><sup>3</sup> The group genetically engineered mice to express two different fluorescently “tagged” proteins: PSD95 attached to a green marker and SAP102 to an orange marker. PSD95 and SAP102 are found exclusively in synapses, so under a microscope the brains of these mice are a canvas of green and orange dots, each dot a synapse. With the naked eye, Grant and colleagues could distinguish three groups of synapses: those with PSD95, those with SAP102, and those with both. But they also measured the brightness, size, and relative density of each dot throughout the brain. Including these factors, they used machine learning to characterize the ~1 billion glowing synapses in the mouse brain. Clustering algorithms categorized 37 subtypes of synapses, each subtype with its own unique signature of brightness, size and density. The way these 37 subtypes are distributed throughout the mouse brain creates the first synaptome “signature” of a brain.</p>
<p>At this point, you could argue that an attempt to catalog 1 billion of anything would find clusters. If one were to catalog a billion cracks in the surface of a highway, groupings would likely arise. Do the synapse subtypes that Grant and colleagues observed have any significance to brain function? The fact that different synapse subtypes were enriched in certain brain regions argues that they do. For example, subtype “24” was abundant in the cerebral cortex and absent in the cerebellum. This makes sense since cerebral cortex and cerebellum develop differently and perform different functions.</p>
<p>Grant and colleagues also show that the synaptome signature is sensitive to insults in brain development. It has long been known that neuropsychiatric diseases like autism and schizophrenia are associated with disrupted brain connectivity. The authors saw changes in the synaptome signature of mutant mice with behavioral abnormalities resembling these neuropsychiatric diseases. These data show that the synaptome is sensitive to developmental disturbances, and changes in it may be a marker for psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>This study is more of a starting point for synaptomics than a presentation of its fruition. For one, this study builds its synaptome map with only two of the synapse’s thousands of proteins. The stated goal of the <em>Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping</em> pipeline is to map as many of these thousands of proteins as possible and incorporate them into a global catalog. What will neuroscience gain from this this catalog? Will future neuroscientists be able to see a memory form or a disease develop by simply “perusing” the catalog? These questions aren’t possible to answer right now, but hopefully this new field will provide some general principles that transcend the astronomical.</p>

<p>The effect of playing sport on men’s testosterone levels is well documented. Generally speaking, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X89900421">the winner enjoys a testosterone boost</a>, while the loser experiences the opposite (though far less studied, competition unsurprisingly also affects women’s hormonal levels, though <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453004000757">not in the same ways as men’s</a>). The evolutionary-based explanation for the hormonal effects seen in men is that the winner’s testosterone rise acts to increase their aggression and the likelihood that they will seek out more contests, while the loser skulks off to lick their wounds. When it comes to vicarious effects of competition on men’s testosterone, however, the findings are more mixed. There’s some evidence that male sports fans show testosterone gains after seeing their teams win, but other studies have failed to replicate this finding.</p>
<p>A new, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9318-2">small study</a> in <em>Human Nature</em> adds to this literature by examining the hormonal changes (testosterone and cortisol) in fathers watching their children play a football game – a situation in which you might particularly expect to see vicarious hormonal effects since it’s the men’s own kin who are involved.</p>
<p><span id="more-34796"></span></p>
<p>The eighteen participating fathers (average age 47) were recruited in the US state of New Mexico where they were watching their kids (average age 13) play in a local football (soccer) tournament. Nine of them were watching their sons play, the others were watching their daughters. The dads provided saliva samples before and after the matches, and also answered some questions about their child and the game.</p>
<p>Anthropologist Louis Alvarado at the University at Albany and his colleagues, including the psychologists Melissa Eaton and Melissa Thompson at the University of New Mexico, found that the fathers’ testosterone and cortisol levels increased after the experience of watching the games (by 81 per cent and 417 per cent, respectively). These changes weren’t linked to the outcomes of the games, but were to an extent explained by whether or not the fathers believed that the referee had acted unfairly towards their child’s team – if they did perceive unfairness, the fathers’ post-match cortisol and testosterone tended to be higher (fathers with higher pre-match testosterone were also more likely to perceive unfairness).</p>
<p>The researchers said this main result of a link between hormonal changes and fairness  perception was “consistent with a functional explanation in which hormonal changes are associated with the potential for future conflict – here, in the context of responding to potential threats affecting one’s own status and that of kin.”</p>
<p>Given that aggression among parents watching their kids has become “an important cultural issue”, the researchers added that their results could “… have implications for the growing body of literature that attempts to curb the problem of sideline violence by identifying the proximate and individualistic factors associated with conflict potential.”</p>
<p>Other findings to come out of the study were that fathers watching their sons showed greater testosterone rises than fathers watching their daughters, as did fathers who felt sports were less important to their child (this latter result was opposite to expectations, and the researchers speculated that it was perhaps connected to the fathers’ frustration or disappointment that their child was not taking the competition seriously enough).</p>
<p>A more technical finding was that gains in the fathers’ “stress hormone” cortisol tended to predict subsequent increases in their testosterone. This result provides tentative support for the so-called “positive coregulation” model of cortisol and testosterone, in which increases in cortisol supplement the effects of testosterone when males are competing, while arguing against the opposite theory that sees cortisol as down-regulating testosterone and reducing the likelihood of the individual engaging in competitive behaviour in times of stress. The researchers said the “positive coregulation” model makes more sense in evolutionary terms, with stress (and cortisol) priming high-ranking male primates to be more competitive when they are faced with the threat of status competition from more junior males.</p>

Chip Gerfen (NIMH) talks about his defining work in describing the input-output organization of the basal ganglia, and how early ideas of pathway-level organization principles have yielded to an appreciation of the explosive anatomical and molecular diversity of individual neurons within those pathways.  The group discusses Chip’s new spearheading of single axon anatomical projection mapping in striatum, and what clues it may offer to our understanding of basal ganglia function.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>You’re in a packed food court, searching for somewhere to sit. Just as you spot a communal table with two free spaces, one much bigger and more comfortable-looking than the other, you realise there’s a person standing beside you with a tray and they are looking for somewhere to sit, too. What do you do? Rush to take the better seat – but appear selfish? Or let them have it, so seem generous – but eat your lunch in cramped discomfort?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-39622-001">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> suggests that you should do neither. Instead, you should say something like, “Oh, go ahead – you choose a seat”, and the odds are that she or he will not only leave the better seat for you, but also think that <i>you’re </i>generous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34794"></span></p>
<p>Psychologists have generally viewed this kind of scenario as either/or – you can either be worse off materially but see your reputation enhanced, or vice versa. But it doesn’t have to be this way, according the results of eight studies involving imaginary and real-world settings, by Michael Kardas, Alex Shaw and Eugene Caruso at the University of Chicago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Using a group of 300 online volunteers, they first explored how often people abdicate decisions about distributing two items of unequal value (like a “premium” granola bar and a “low-quality” version) between themselves and a friend. Nearly 70 per cent said they’d choose to abdicate the decision, mostly because they wanted to be seen as generous. In a real-world version of this study, which was conducted in a local park on pairs of people who knew each other, a roughly similar proportion – about two-thirds of the participants – chose to abdicate the decision, and when they did, the other person gave away the more valuable item more often than they kept it for themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A further online study, of 310 people, found that when the participants were informed, in imaginary scenarios, that their friend had abdicated a sharing decision to them, they were much more likely to give away the higher-value object than to keep it, in comparison to a scenario in which they simply had to make the decision about who got what. The researchers write that this is consistent with the idea that abdication is viewed as an act of generosity, which then prompts generosity in return. (Further studies reported in the paper provide additional evidence for this.)</p>
<p>The abdication effect wasn’t only observed between friends. Participants were more likely to be selfish, and keep the high-value option, when they were simply told to decide what they or a stranger would get. But when they were told that the stranger had first abdicated the decision to them, they were again much more likely to give away the high-value option than to keep it. This held in both imaginary situations and in a real world-scenario involving gift cards of different amounts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The majority of the data reported in this paper came out of imagined rather than actual scenarios, and whether all the findings would replicate in the real world isn’t yet clear. But the effect sizes in terms of the percentages of people opting to abdicate, and opting to give away the more valuable item when informed that the other person had abdicated, were similar in both types of study, the researchers point out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“In sum,” they write, “abdication seems to be beneficial in more ways than one: abdicators are not only perceived to be generous, but they also tend to receive the larger slice of the pie.” Or, as they also put it, “abdication provides a unique opportunity for people to give up their cake and eat it too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXXIV) Is the brain a computer (2)</a></h4>

<p>In a <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/">previous post</a>, I argued that the way the brain works is not algorithmic, and therefore it is not a computer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">the common sense of the term</a>. This contradicts a popular view in computational neuroscience that the brain is a kind of a computer that implements algorithms. That view comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">formal neural network theory</a>, and the argumentation goes as follows. Formal neural networks can implement any computable function, which is a function that can be implemented by an algorithm. Thus the brain can implement algorithms for computable functions, and therefore is by definition a computer. There are multiple errors in this reasoning. The most salient error is a semantic drift on the concept of algorithm, the second major error is a confusion on what a computer is.</p>
<p><u>Algorithms</u></p>
<p>A computable function is a function that can be implemented by an algorithm. But the converse “if a function is computable, then whatever implements this function runs an algorithm” is not true. To see this, we need to be a bit more specific about what is meant by “algorithm” and “computable function”.</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> is simply a set of explicit instructions to solve a problem. A cooking recipe is an algorithm in this sense. For example, to cook pasta: put water in a pan; heat up; when water boils, put pasta; wait for 10 minutes. The execution of this algorithm occurs in continuous time in a real environment. But what is algorithmic about this description is the discrete sequential flow of instructions. Water boiling itself is not algorithmic, the high-level instructions are: “when condition A is true (water boils), then do B (put pasta)”. Thus, when we speak of algorithms, we must define what is considered as elementary instructions, that is, what is beneath the algorithmic level (water boils, put pasta).</p>
<p>The textbook definition of algorithm in computer science is: "a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output." (Cormen et al., <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Introduction to algorithms</a>; possibly the most used textbook on the subject). Computability is a way to formalize the notion of algorithm for functions of integers (in particular logical functions). To formalize it, one needs to specify what is considered an elementary instruction. Thus, computability does not formalize the loose notion of algorithm above, i.e, any recipe to calculate something, for otherwise any function would be computable and the concept would be empty (to calculate f(x), apply f to x). A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function">computable function</a> is a function that can be calculated by a Turing machine, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-recursive_function">equivalently</a>, which can be generated by a small set of elementary functions on integers (with composition and recursion). Thus, an algorithm in the sense of computability theory is a discrete-time sequence of arithmetic and logical operations (and recursion). Note that this readily extend to any countable alphabet instead of integers, and of course you can replace arithmetic and logical operations with higher-order instructions, as long as they are themselves computable (ie a high-level programming language). But it is not <em>any</em> kind of specification of how to solve a problem. For example, there are various algorithms to calculate pi. But we could also calculate pi by drawing a circle, measuring both the diameter and the perimeter, then dividing perimeter by diameter. This is not an algorithm in the sense of computability theory. It could be called an algorithm in the broader sense, but again note that what is algorithmic about it is the discrete structure of the instructions.</p>
<p>Thus, a device could calculate a computable function using an algorithm in the strict sense of computability, or in the broader sense (cooking recipe), or in a non-algorithmic way (i.e., without any discrete structure of instructions). In any case, what the brain or any device manages to do bears no relation with how it does it.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, what is algorithmic about a description of how something works is the discrete structure (first do A; if B is true, then do C, etc). If we removed this condition, then we would be left with the more general concept of model, not algorithm: a description of how something works. Thus, if we want to say anything specific by claiming that the brain implements algorithms, then we must insist on the discrete-time structure (steps). Otherwise, we are just saying that the brain has a model.</p>
<p>Now that we have more precisely defined what an algorithm is, let us examine whether the brain might implement algorithms. Clearly, it does not literally implement algorithms in the narrow sense of computability theory, i.e., with elementary operations on integers and recursion. But could it be that it implements algorithms in the broader sense? To get some perspective, consider the following two physical systems:</p>
<p><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig10.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1538" height="122" src="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig10-300x122.png" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>(A) are dominoes, (B) is a tent (illustration taken from my essay “<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?</a>”). Both are physical systems that interact with an environment, in particular which can be perturbed by mechanical stimuli. The response of dominoes to mechanical stimuli might be likened to an algorithm, but that of the tent cannot. The fact that we can describe unambiguously (with physics) how the tent reacts to mechanical stimuli does not make the dynamics of the tent algorithmic, and the same is true of the brain. Formal neural networks (e.g. perceptrons or deep learning networks) are algorithmic, but the brain is a priori more like the tent: a set of coupled neurons that interact in continuous time, together and with the environment, with no evident discrete structure similar to an algorithm. As argued above, a specification of how these real neural networks work and solve problems is not an algorithm: it’s a model – unless we manage to map the brain’s dynamics to the discrete flow of an algorithm.</p>
<p><u>Computers</u></p>
<p>Thus, if a computer is something that solves problems by running algorithms, then the brain is not a computer. We may however consider a broader definition: the computer is something that computes, i.e., which is able to calculate computable functions. As pointed out above, this does not require the computer to run algorithms. For example, consider a box with some gas, a heater (input = temperature T) and a pressure sensor (output = P). The device computes the function P = nRT/V by virtue of physical laws, and not by an algorithm.</p>
<p>This box, however, is not a computer. Otherwise, any physical system would be called a computer. To be called a computer, the device should be able to implement any computable function. But what does it mean exactly? To run an arbitrary computable function, some parameters of the device need to be appropriately adjusted. Who adjusts these parameters and how? If we do not specify how this adjustment is being made, then the claim that the brain is a computer is essentially empty. It just says that for each function, there is a way to arrange the structure of the brain so that this function is achieved. It is essentially equivalent to the claim that atoms can calculate any computable function, depending on how we arrange them.</p>
<p>To call such a device a computer, we must additionally include a mechanism to adjust the parameters so that it does actually perform a particular computable function. This leads us to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">conventional definition of a computer</a>: something that can be <em>instructed</em> via <em>computer programming</em>. The notion of program is central to the definition of computers, whatever form this program takes. A crucial implication is that a computer is a device that is dependent on an external operator for its function. The external operator brings the software to the computer; without the ability to receive software, the device is not a computer.</p>
<p>In this sense, the brain cannot be a computer. We may then consider the following metaphorical extension: the brain is a self-programmed computer. But the circularity in this assertion is problematic. If the program is a result of the program itself, then the “computer” cannot actually implement <em>any</em> computable function, but only those that result from its autonomous functioning. A cat, a mouse, an ant and a human do not actually do the same things, and cannot even in principle do the same tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, is computability theory the right framework to describe the activity of the brain in the first place? It is certainly not the right framework to describe the interaction of a tent with its environment, so why would it be appropriate for the brain, an embodied dynamical system in circular relation with the environment? Computability theory is a theory about functions. But a dynamical system is not a function. You can of course define functions on dynamical systems, even though they do not fully characterize the system. For example, you can define the function that maps the current state to the state at some future time. In the case of the brain, we might want to define a function that maps an external perturbation of the system (i.e. a stimulus) to the state of the system at some future time. However, this is not well defined, because it depends on the state of the system at the time of the perturbation. This problem does not occur with formal neural networks precisely because these are not dynamical systems but mappings. The brain is spontaneously active, whether there is a “stimulus” or not. The very notion of the organism as something that responds to stimuli is the most naïve version of behaviorism. The organism has an endogenous activity and a circular relation to its environment. Consider for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator">central pattern generators</a>: these are rhythmic patterns produced in the absence of any input. Not all dynamical systems can be framed into computability theory, and in fact most of them, including the brain, cannot because they are not mappings.</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u></p>
<p>As I have argued in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">my essay on neural coding</a>, there are two core problems with the computer metaphor of the brain (it should be clear by now that this is a metaphor and not a property). One is that it tries to match two causal structures that are totally incongruent, just like dominoes and a tent. The other is that the computer metaphor, just as the coding metaphor, implicitly assumes an external operator – who programs it / interprets the code. Thus, what these two metaphors fundamentally miss is the epistemic autonomy of the organism.</p>

<p>Psychologists<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>have already established that minority groups are particularly likely to endorse conspiracy theories that involve them. For instance, the idea that AIDS was concocted in a lab to plague black people or that birth control is black genocide have been shown to have particular traction within African-American communities. It’s thought this is because members of disadvantaged groups find comfort in explanatory frameworks that appear to account for the various factors that beleaguer them. But new research from VU Amsterdam and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3442">published in <i>Applied Cognitive Psychology</i></a> suggests that belonging to a minority identity, in this case being Muslim in the Netherlands or a member of an ethnic minority in that country, doesn’t merely lead to a belief in conspiracy theories related to that specific minority identity, but stokes an appetite for conspiracies in general.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34817"></span></p>
<p>Jan-Willem van Prooijen and his colleagues explain that there seem to be two reasons why minorities are drawn to conspiracies. First is the unpleasant feeling of not being personally regarded as a full member of society. This motivates people to make sense of their situation, but from a position of discomfort and negative emotion that breeds a suspicious attitude – a perfect pot in which to brew conspiracy. The second is a broader concern about the treatment of their minority group, which explains why, in the US, research has found that affluent African Americans with greater access to participation in society are as likely as their poorer counterparts to believe in conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Van Prooijen’s team recognised that these two factors, as well as making minorities susceptible to specific conspiracies targeted towards the identity group, could easily generalise. After all, every conspiracy theory needs its perpetrators – powerful figures in the majority group who are pulling the strings. And once you buy in to the idea that such figures exist and are shaping the world in nefarious ways, then you have opened the door to a broader conspiratorial world-view.</p>
<p>To test this, the researchers looked at how conspiratorial beliefs were associated with Muslim and also ethnic minority status. They combined a sample acquired through social media with a group drawn from voters for a Dutch party popular among Muslim minorities, which amounted to 205 Muslim participants, most of whom were also from a minority ethnic group, and 146 non-muslims, of which 44 were from an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>Participants rated their belief in thirteen different conspiracies, which came from four categories. One category involved Muslim victims – for example in this category was the claim that the US carried out 9/11 to make Islam look bad and invade the Middle East. Another category was centred on Jewish antagonists, such as the claim that Jewish bankers are controlling the world economy, which is another common theme in established Muslim conspiratorial beliefs. The two remaining categories were not tied to prototypical Muslim themes, being either economic (the medical industry is hiding the cure for cancer to maximise their revenue) or from the vast roster of unclassifiable conspiracies, such as: there were UFOs at Roswell; Diana was murdered by the royals; and the media are controlled by a left-wing elite.</p>
<p>Van Prooijen’s team found that Muslim participants not only tended to believe more strongly in conspiracies directly related to their identity, but also in the economic and miscellaneous conspiracies too. Moreover, strength of conspiracy belief (of all forms) was driven by the two factors previously associated with endorsement of identity-specific conspiracy belief – levels of personal deprivation (measured through giving a low rating to the item: “To what extent do you feel like a Dutch citizen?”) and group deprivation as measured by strength of agreement with items like “I believe Islam is being suppressed in the West.” Independently of Muslim religion, the same pattern was found for the effect of being a member of an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>When we are prompted to think of prominent conspiracists, for many of us the first names that come to mind<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are probably white men like Alex Jones or David Icke, making it easy to assume that in the West it is the White majority who are more prone to conspiracy beliefs. But this is likely the “availability bias” at work (these names are simply the easiest to think of), or due to the fact these men have figured out how to monetise conspiracy. The new findings, though preliminary and limited by being based in a single European country, suggest in fact it is minorities who are more likely to endorse conspiracy-based explanations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If further research supports this assertion, it would make sense of something I read recently about Dylan Avery, the US film-maker behind <i>Loose Change</i>, a film that questioned the official account of 9/11 and which many consider a catalyst for the conspiracy movement. Avery went on to make a film about police brutality in Black communities, and he was initially wary of mentioning his past work, afraid of the reputation it had accrued – but in fact found that he got <i>more</i> interviews with African Americans if he mentioned his prior work on 9/11. This fits with the new findings that suggest majorities in society have less incentive to question the status quo, while it’s those feeling marginalised who are likely to spy something going on behind the scenes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

These include the fact that the publishers castigated by the film would continue to dominate scholarly communication in an OA world; the increasingly expensive ‘pay-to-publish’ model, which substitutes inequities in access for inequities in affording publication; and the rise of predatory publishing. And although <i>Paywall</i> acknowledges that current reward systems have slowed the progress of OA publishing, it does not address the puzzling question of why academics have proved so reluctant to make copies of their published papers freely available in their institutional repositories ...</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>More </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7">here</a><span>.</span></div>

This is a story of a plant scientist in France, Steffen Reinbothe. He and his sister Christiane used to hold academic positions in Germany, but now they both returned to France, to Grenoble. The move might have had to do with a dossier from 2009, made by a former lab member and circulated among peers.
Whatever concerns any peers might have had: Steffen and Christiane Reinbothe could rely on the "contributed" track at PNAS.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Earlier this year, we partnered with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to provide authors the opportunity to post their manuscripts as a preprint on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> through our submission system. In July, we started to implement a new feature linking PLOS articles to their matching bioRxiv preprint—regardless of whether they were submitted through the PLOS integration. This means any article published in a PLOS journal will be linked to its bioRxiv preprint, if posted, and adds on to the existing links from bioRxiv preprints to their journal publications.</p>
<p>What’s the benefit? For starters, it ensures that the early impact of the preprint is visible alongside the publication and enables the reader to learn the paper’s history. Forming these links shows more of the vital history of a research work, with a public life that started as a preprint, was shared online, and continued through peer review to journal publication. By linking papers with their preprints, we hope to make an important part of the paper’s life cycle accessible to our readers.</p>
<p>We actively <a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints">support preprints</a> as a vital part of the scientific literature. Preprints enable authors to get results out early, gain feedback on their manuscript from a wider community, accrue citations and time stamp their work. Preprints are indexed in Crossref and Google Scholar so they form a documented part of the ‘research story’ for the journal publications that may follow them. In the future we’ll work toward forming links with more preprint servers to ensure this feature is utilized across servers and scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>Our preprint service is free of charge and automated. All you have to do is opt-in when submitting your paper. The feature includes creation of a Preprint PDF from the author’s submission files (optional), screening checks and a seamless deposit to bioRxiv to make this process as easy as possible. Authors can focus on their journal submission, knowing their results will soon be available online as they work through the review process.</p>
<p>Note: <em>PLOS Medicine continues to permit authors to post preprints of their research, but given the particular issues related to research in human health, does not currently offer transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv.</em></p>

<p>Part of the strength of the widely endorsed Big Five model of personality is its efficient explanatory power – in the traits of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, it removes the redundancy of more fine-grained approaches and manages to capture the most meaningful variance in our habits of thought and behaviour.</p>
<p>So what to make then of the popular proposal that what marks out high achievers from the rest is that they rank highly on another trait labelled as “<a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience">Grit”</a>?</p>
<p>Is the recognition of Grit, and the development of a scale to measure it, a breakthrough in our understanding of the psychology of success? Or is it a reinvention of the wheel, a redundant addition to the taxonomy of personality psychology?</p>
<p>In 2016, the US-based authors of a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29674-001">meta-analysis</a> on the topic concluded “that Grit as currently measured is simply a repackaging of Conscientiousness”. Now a different research team, based in Germany and Switzerland, has taken a more intricate look at the links between Grit and Conscientiousness, this time including a focus on their respective facets (or sub-traits). Writing <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2171">in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em></a>, Fabian Schmidt and his colleagues conclude that “Grit represents yet another contribution to the common problem of redundant labelling of constructs in personality psychology.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34810"></span></p>
<p>Schmidt’s team asked two samples of hundreds of participants (one made up of school pupils, average age 15; the other a diverse group of adults, average age 32) to complete: a German version of the original brief Grit scale, which consists of 4 items tapping <em>perseverance</em> in the face of adversity, and 4 tapping focus and <em>consistency</em> of interests; and a German version of the 48 Conscientiousness items from the NEO-PIR (a well-established and validated scale based on the Big Five model).</p>
<p>The researchers then used advanced statistical techniques to see how much variance in participants’ answers on one of the scales overlapped with the variance in their answers on the other – to oversimplify, this provided a measure of redundancy or whether the two scales were essentially measuring the same constructs or not – and, unlike in prior research, this included making detailed comparisons between the global traits (Grit and Conscientiousness) and their respective facets (perseverance and consistency in the case of Grit; and competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline and deliberation in the case of Conscientiousness).</p>
<p>The researchers found the perseverance facet of Grit (which past studies have suggested is responsible for most of the links between Grit and later success) shared 95 per cent of its variance with trait Conscientiousness and with its “pro-active” facets – that is, all those sub-traits that pertain to being industrious and driven. The global Grit trait (incorporating both its facets) similarly shared a large amount of variance with Conscientiousness and with its pro-active facets.</p>
<p>In other words, Grit, and especially its perseverance facet, are really just tapping into the pro-active aspects of Conscientiousness that are to do with being industrious and achievement focused (as opposed to the inhibitive aspects, which are more about orderliness and self-control). “Claiming that grit is just proactive Conscientiousness or industriousness … would stand in accordance with our findings,” the researchers said. Put differently, the findings suggest that proponents of Grit are falling for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle-jangle_fallacies">jangle fallacy</a> – mistakenly believing they are measuring something different because they have given a new name to an existing concept.</p>
<p>The story was a little more complicated for the consistency facet of Grit, which is to do with staying focused on one or only a few interests. Past research has shown that this facet is far less relevant to, or predictive of, future success than perseverance. Here it shared 69 per cent of its variance with Conscientiousness, suggesting that it overlapped with this trait but was also measuring something else besides. However, it remains for future research to establish whether consistency should ideally be incorporated into the Big Five model as an extra Conscientiousness facet (after all, the existing Conscientiousness facets also display their own unique variance suggesting they measure Conscientiousness plus a little of something else) or whether it is actually better placed elsewhere, as a facet associated with low Neuroticism, for example, or even low Openness.</p>
<p>Schmidt and his team concluded that perseverance, the facet of Grit that has received most attention because of its links with success and achievement, is a redundant concept.  It is really just another word for industriousness, which is already a well-researched and recognised aspect of the pro-active side of Conscientiousness.</p>
<p>“To waive the use of some of the redundant labels would enhance the clarity and consistency of research in personality psychology,” they said. On a more positive note, they added that the 4 items of the brief Grit scale that tap perseverance seem to provide an incredibly concise measure of industriousness or pro-active Conscientiousness, making the Grit scale possibly “one of the most economic ways currently available” to measure these important constructs.</p>

<p>Talking to someone new can be daunting, but such conversations “have the power to turn strangers into friends, coffee dates into marriages, and interviews into jobs,” note the authors of a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618783714">new paper</a>, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, which has found that perhaps we shouldn’t feel so anxious about them. Across five studies, the researchers explored what strangers thought about each other after chatting, and they found consistent evidence for what they call a “liking gap” – other people like us more than we think. Though in other areas of life many of us have a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/05/the-brain-basis-of-unrealistic-optimism/">rosy-tinted view of our abilities</a>, it seems that we tend to<i> under</i>-estimate how we come across socially.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34785"></span></p>
<p>For the first study, Erica Boothby at Cornell University, US, and her fellow researchers simply paired up 34 students for a guided conversation (with ice-breaker questions provided) for five minutes, and got them to complete some personality scales and ratings of the conversation, including what they thought of their partner and how they imagined their partner would rate them. The researchers found that the participants significantly under-estimated how much their partner liked them. And the analysis of the personality data revealed one key driver: the shyer the person, the bigger the liking gap (only for those who ranked low for shyness did the gap disappear entirely).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The second study, of a fresh group of 84 students, explored the potential role of negative thoughts in accounting for the gap. As the researchers note, when we talk to someone we don’t know too well, we often worry about whether we’re coming across as over-chatty, perhaps, or boring. And afterwards, many people have a tendency to be self-critical, focusing on what they did wrong, and judging themselves harshly – thinking perhaps that they talked too much about themselves, or that they did a bad job at telling a joke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants in this second study were asked to talk for five minutes with their partner about whatever they wanted. When they reflected on the conversation afterwards, they reported that, while they were talking, their thoughts about how the other person was viewing them were more negative than their thoughts about their partner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> –</span> and this difference was related to how much they believed the other person liked them.</p>
<p>For the third study, the researchers asked pairs of strangers (from the general public and students) to talk together for as long as they liked, for up to 45 minutes. Whether the conversation lasted 2 or 45 minutes, the liking gap remained. This study also revealed an “enjoyment gap”: regardless of the length of the conversation, the participants under-estimated how much their partner enjoyed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The fourth and fifth studies moved the investigation out of the lab, into real-world settings: workshops for entrepreneurs and members of the British public on “how to talk to strangers”, and into first-year dormitory suites at Yale University. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The workshop data (involving 100 people) showed that participants tended to predict that their conversation partner would find them less interesting than they would find their partner to be – a mistaken belief that was magnified after the conversation. The dorm study, meanwhile, surveyed new students at the start of the fall semester, in September, and then at four further points until May and found that they under-estimated how much their suite-mates liked them at all of the time-points except for the final one. Clearly, the liking gap can persist for a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Conversation appears to be a domain in which people display uncharacteristic pessimism about their performance,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might be adaptive in a way because a bias toward reflecting on our conversational mistakes might prompt us to perform better next time. Strangers, on the other hand, are judging us according a different metric – they have no idea of the performance we’re aiming for, and so no clue when we fall short of that target – making them less critical. And they probably didn’t have high expectations at the outset. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/">People’s predictions about how rewarding it will be to talk to someone new</a> are, as the researchers write, often “pretty dismal…So whereas speakers are thinking that they have failed to live up to their ideal, listeners are thinking that it could have been much worse, and this different standard of comparison for oneself and for others may well be one reason that people underestimate how much their conversation partners enjoy their company.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>An analysis of data from the first study also suggests that because we’re often so wrapped up in thinking about our own performance, and what to say next, we neglect to notice signals from the other person that indicate that they’re actually enjoying the conversation.</p>
<p>The main message from these five studies? In the researchers’ words: “others like us more than we know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/IMG_0093-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>TERMIS 2018 took place during early September in the beautiful city of Kyoto, Japan, a place with a staggering collection of 1,600 temples, filled with UNESCO World Heritage sites and a history of more than 1,000 years.</p>
<p>The meeting kicked off with the arrival of typhoon Jebi and despite the hindering conditions, the organizers, led by the Conference Chairs, <a href="https://www2.infront.kyoto-u.ac.jp/te02/members/tabata/tabata3_en.html">Prof Yasuhiko Tabata</a> and <a href="http://www.dma.jim.osaka-u.ac.jp/view?l=en&amp;u=8183">Prof Yoshiki Sawa</a> (also the President of the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine) in an admirable effort, ensured that all of the sessions went ahead uninterrupted, in what resulted to be an outstanding venue for ideas exchange and productive debate around the field’s highest accomplishments.</p>
<h3><strong>A unified approach</strong></h3>
<p>This year’s theme was “Integration of Industry, Government, and Academia for Regenerative Medicine”. The theme echoed across the duration of the meeting, with academic, governmental and industry experts leading discussions across all aspects of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM).</p>
<p>The first day was centered on TERMEX 2018, an industry event aimed at sharing the latest updates on the industrialization, regulation, market insights, international development and other surrounding issues in TERM. We were privileged to learn about the different opportunities and challenges that companies face across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.</p>

<p>A talk that stood out was one by <a href="https://www.ccrm.ca/michael_may">Dr Michael May</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.ccrm.ca/">CCRM</a>, a not-for-profit organization supporting companies to develop and commercialize cell and gene therapy technologies in Canada. He characterized regenerative medicine as the hottest area in biotech and one that has achieved elevated business activity through capital efficient collaborative models.</p>
<p>In Europe, <a href="https://ct.catapult.org.uk/about-us/our-team/our-management-team">Dr Michael Bennet</a>, from <a href="https://catapult.org.uk/">Catapult</a>, a center helping cell and gene therapy organisations worldwide develop early stage research into commercial products, emphasized that therapies are extraordinarily expensive, with complex process controls and supply chains. Innovators need to seek advice early on to ensure that their products adhere to the highest standards.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weisslab.net/">Prof Anthony Weiss</a> (University of Sydney), founder of <a href="http://www.elastagen.com/">elastagen</a>, an Australian company with an array of products based on elastin (a critical component of human tissues), gave an inspiring talk around how our aging population creates a demand for novel, effective and easily translatable technologies in skin and aesthetic engineering.</p>
<h3><strong>Pushing the boundaries of science</strong></h3>
<p>The highly anticipated Presidential address by <a href="https://3bs.uminho.pt/users/rgreis">Prof Rui Reis</a> (<a href="https://3bs.uminho.pt/">3B’s Research Group</a>, University of Minho) was undeniably one of the meeting’s highlights. His talk radiated a tone of optimism for rapid future developments in the field, and presented some of his group’s pioneering work on natural origin materials, their approach in scaffold design and processing, as well as their design of a multi chamber bioreactor for 3D hierarchical cell cultures, a device that has already resulted in a spin-out company.</p>
<p>The synergistic nature of the field is evident in the work of <a href="https://bioengineering.rice.edu/antonios-g-mikos">Prof Antonios Mikos</a> (Rice University). His talk on ‘In vivo Bioreactors for Craniofacial Tissue Regeneration’ showcased research conducted in partnership with the <a href="http://www.afirm.mil/">Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine</a> (AFIRM) that aims to accelerate regenerative medicine solutions for the treatment of battlefield injuries.</p>
<p>Some of their major accomplishments include the development of space maintainers (non-degradable materials that keep the area for regeneration empty), which in combination with in vivo bioreactor technologies form a holistic personalized medicine strategy for the regeneration of multiple tissues (including bone, nerves, vascular system, soft tissue, etc.) that can integrate with the mandible and achieve functional tissue repair.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10526 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/42490-Image-211x300.jpg" width="211" />The scientific sessions were varied and impressive and unfortunately it is impossible to mention all of the ones that stood out. However, we were honored to attend a session chaired by our very own <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em></a> Editors, <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/engineering-informatics/biomedical-engineering/research/researchtopics/drdimitrioszeugolis/">Prof Dimitrios Zeugolis</a> (NUI Galway) and <a href="https://3bs.uminho.pt/users/megomes">Prof Manuela Gomes</a> (University of Minho). In particular, the session’s keynote talk by <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/hutmache/">Prof Dietmar Hutmacher</a> (Queensland University of Technology) on ‘Animal models in clinical translation and commercialization of TE and RM therapies – myths and reality’ didn’t fail to impress, as he described some of his group’s approaches on the critical topic of clinical translation.</p>
<p>Despite the array of industrial difficulties (process complexity, high costs, strict regulatory diligence, etc.) that TERM faces in transferring its research and new technologies to the clinic, one needs to acknowledge that it is a purposeful and close-knit community that has recognized some of the field’s grand challenges and now unifies to pursue them. We very much look forward to future developments at TERMIS 2021 and the progress towards the field’s common goal, the improvement of human health.</p>
<h3><strong>Springer Nature @ TERMIS 2018</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10524 alignright" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Prof-Redl-e1537522218169-225x300.jpg" width="225" />
<p>By far the most highlighted academic resource at the meeting, which even received an honorable mention during the Presidential address, was <a href="http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en/team/mitarbeiter/univ-prof-dr-heinz-redl">Prof Heinz Redl</a>’s new book on ‘<a href="https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319454436">3D Printing and Biofabrication</a>’, published by <a href="https://www.springer.com/gb">Springer</a>, which forms part of a series of 15 books on ‘<a href="https://www.springer.com/series/13441">Tissue Engineering and Regeneration</a>’. Our Editorial Advisor, <a href="http://www.tissuemodulation.com/mira.html">Prof Michael Raghunath</a> (Zurich University of Applied Sciences), has authored an excellent chapter on macromolecular crowding for tissue engineering.</p>
<p>Prof Heinz Redl is the current Chair for <a href="https://www.termis.org/chapters-europe">TERMIS-Europe</a>, the Director of <a href="http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en">the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Experimental and Clinical Traumatology</a>, the founder of <a href="http://www.traumacareconsult.com/">Trauma Care Consult</a> and a collaborator of numerous major industrial partners. We were privileged to host this book at the Springer Nature booth and speak with countless academics and industry representatives, who were interested to learn more about it. We will soon be publishing an exclusive interview with Prof Redl and discuss future developments in the field, his work at TERMIS, his recent book and more!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, this year’s TERMIS World Congress featured a highly anticipated session by the Chief Editor for <a href="https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/"><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/about/editors">Dr. Pep Pamies</a>, on ‘The Diversifying Nature of Impact’. The talk dissected impact factor and challenged its historical use in the assessment of researchers and articles. He suggested data-driven alternative metrics, including qualitative measures and provided a more holistic view for the nature of impact. This is a true testament to the ethos of the journal and its pioneering work beyond citations and towards the <em>facilitation</em> of truly ground-breaking research. The interested reader may refer to his recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0189-y">editorial</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>Let’s start with some really good news. Scientists from the University of Leeds kicked cancer in the balls. Or, more scientifically speaking, aggressive brain tumor cells were forced to self-destruct after being exposed to a specific synthetic chemical <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111643" target="_blank">[1].</a> Glioblastoma, the cancer in question, is a real bitch -- it is hard to treat and hard to survive. Originally, the authors just wanted to test whether this synthetic molecule would have a therapeutic effect and slow the cancer down; what they got, however, was something even better. The said chemical had a toxic effect on the cancer cells and basically just messed with their mitochondria (powerhouse of the cell!). This shut down the energy supply of the cells and led to their destruction. Moreover, the scientists tested whether this chemical can cross the blood-brain-barrier, a border that separates circulating blood from our precious brain, by first introducing glioblastoma into mice and then injecting them with the chemical. And indeed: it successfully crossed the barrier and decreased the tumor growth by around 50%. Also good to mention that normal brain cells were unaffected by the killer molecule. It is still a long way before human trials are approved but it is extremely promising. In your face, cancer!</p>

<p>Now for everyone's favorite topic of psychedelics (favorite to the extent of me getting mails from random dudes asking where to get DMT… Not the fame I asked for). First off, neuroscientists at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who normally study social behavior of animals decided to go one (or rather hundred) step(s) further and to give MDMA to octopuses <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30991-6" target="_blank">[2].</a> Ecstasy is known to make people extraverted, sociable, happy and longing for physical touch and the researchers wondered whether the drug would have the same effect on the social behavior of species which is a) completely different to humans and b) is known to live a solitary life and not being super social (now I’m bitter the labs I worked in never had such brilliant ideas). First off, the scientists analyzed the octopus genom and found out that they also have genes that create serotonin transporters in the brain (serotonin is the neurotransmitter which gets released in excessive amounts after taking ecstasy). They proceeded by adding ecstasy in water tanks and see there — octopuses started telling all their friends they love them while listening to techno. Or almost — they started spending more time with the fellow octopuses and even touching each other and other objects not just with one but with as many as six tentacles. Also this happened: “Another octopus was doing backflips and looked like he was playing in the water, but we don't have good ways of quantifying that.". Well, if that isn’t what I see in Berlin clubs. Overall, the scientists believe that serotonin does play an important role in the social behavior of octopuses just like it does in humans. Moreover, despite the huge differences between our brains (as the octopuses don’t have a cortex or a reward circuit like we do) it seems like the social behavior is built in on the molecular level. It is incredible that a creature with a brain which developed completely different from our own reacts to a drug in the same way — and indicates that the brain pathways of social behavior may have arisen in our common ancestor (which is more than 500 million years ago). </p>

<p>And now for human studies. For one, researchers have found that taking DMT induces a state which is very similar to the near death experience (NDE) <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full" target="_blank">[3].</a> In order to find that out they asked people who actually experienced NDE and people whom they gave DMT to fill out a standardized questionnaire trying to grasp their experience and then compared them. Turns out, that all the people who took DMT scored above the threshold for determining an NDE; meaning that DMT seems to be able to mimic content and intensity of almost dying. The shared experiences included being in an unearthly environment, feeling peace, separating from your own body and encountering some kind of a ~~mysterious God-like entity~~. Next step would be to compare the MRI scans of both groups in order to see whether the a DMT high and an NDE share a neuroscientific basis -- and then we can step by step understand the psychology and biology of dying better. These findings alone are, however, already important, as they show that an NDE happens not because God is getting to ready to welcome Her child but because of our neurons in our brains firing in a specific way.</p>

<p>Not only that, FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) has recently approved a trial where psilocybin (the main ingredient in magic mushrooms) is gonna be used to treat depression <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-receives-fda-approval-for-psilocybin-therapy-clinical-trial-for-treatment-resistant-depression-691452071.html" target="_blank">[4]</a>. Due to the recent psychedelic Renaissance (I wrote about it here — <a href="http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam" target="_blank">click!</a>) it is known that psilocybin, LSD and ayahuasca have an immense potential to treat mental diseases (again, briefly described <a href="http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam" target="_blank">here</a> or if you want more hit me up for a research paper I wrote for the uni on this topic), so that it’s only logical that FDA gives a green light for a phase two trial. 216 patients with treatment-resistant depression will participate in the study where they will receive doses of the drug coupled with therapy sessions. If the trial is successful it can mean a marketing authorization in two to three years which is a huge revolution in depression treatment: psychedelics act fast, the effect lasts long and the side effects are virtually non-existent (if done in a controlled medical setting of course).</p><p>And last but not least, blindness has received a kick in the private areas as well: researchers have successfully reversed congenital blindness in mice by manipulating cells in their retina <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=30111842" target="_blank">[5]</a>. To do that, they used gene therapy and transformed supportive cells called Müller glia (which normally just care about retina being stable) into photoreceptors, the light-sensitive cells that actually allow us to see. Photoreceptors themselves cannot regenerate, whereas Müller cells have been shown to divide in response to injury and regenerate into photoreceptors and other retinal cells (this was shown in zebrafish, but still). With some gene therapy magic the scientists first forced the Müller cells to divide and then injected mice’ eyes with chemicals forcing the freshly divided cells to become something completely different. The newly created photoreceptors did not differ in structure from the normal ones; moreover, they functioned just as well! They were communicating with other photoreceptors and successfully transmitting the light signals to the brain. Now the scientists are running behavioral studies in order to test the performance of mice who regained their vision in tasks that require eyesight (big if true). </p>

<p>Every year three quarters of a million people take their own lives, and suicide is the leading cause of death in adolescents. Non-lethal self-harm is also prolific, leading annually to around 300,000 UK hospital visits, with even more going unreported. Knowing who is at most risk can inform support and prevention efforts. The higher rates of self-harm in LGBT and minority groups are well-established, and now a new <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12179">review article</a> in the <i>British Journal of Clinical Psychology</i> identifies other groups, including goths, emos and metalheads, who may also be at increased risk.</p>
<p><span id="more-34778"></span></p>
<p>The British team, led by Mairead Anne Hughes at the University of Liverpool, searched both quantitative and qualitative papers on suicide and self-harm to find those that measured affiliation to a subculture – defined as marking oneself out through particular clothes, makeup, body art and musical preferences. They identified ten relevant papers, all but one involving people under 24.</p>
<p>In the quantitative research, a number of studies categorised participants based purely on their musical preferences (for example, based on subscriptions to <i>Metal Edge</i> magazine). These studies showed small associations between being a heavy metal fan and greater suicidal ideation and risk. However, in the one study that accounted for potential confounders, like having a negligent father and substance use, the link disappeared.</p>
<p>Looking at alternative subculture membership more generally, the team found two studies suggesting that moderate or stronger identification with a subculture is associated with a three times higher risk of self-harm and six times higher risk of suicide.</p>
<p>One explanation could simply be that people who self harm are more likely to gravitate to these subcultures. Consistent with this interpretation, the studies found associations between subculture membership and various pre-existing adversities, including bullying, difficult family relationships, and emotional and behavioural difficulties. On the other hand, several studies found that controlling for these pre-existing adversities did not eliminate the sub-culture/self-harm association.</p>
<p>Even stronger evidence comes from a longitudinal study of around 4,000 young people that found as participants became more affiliated with the subculture, their odds of self-harm increased, even after adjusting for factors like previous depression, victimisation, and history of self-harm. So this makes it unlikely that the sub-culture association with self-harm could be due entirely to selection effects.</p>
<p>This leaves two other major explanations. One is that self-harm is the consequence of the unasked for social consequences of being an emo, goth, or metaller – such as stigma, hate crime, and victimisation. The other is that subculture membership, by its very nature, encourages self-harm by modelling these behaviours in lyrics and through the example set by leading figures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two qualitative papers explored this latter possibility, based on analysis of internet forum comments and on interviews with emo adolescents. Their conclusions support the idea that self-harm and suicide are accepted and normalised in these subcultures, including praising of acts of self harm. But Hughes and her colleagues wondered if the data could have been interpreted differently, and they noted that online chat forums have a “performative quality” that doesn’t always give the best sense of what is really going on in people’s lives. Also, it’s worth noting that a fascination with suicide and self-harm can also be found in mainstream culture, such as in the recent Netflix hit <i>13 Reasons Why</i>.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up in alternative subcultures I can see the reasons for concern about contagion and modelling. I remember the breathless reporting around Manic Street Preachers’ guitarist Richey Edward’s cutting, and the preoccupation with the destruction of the body found in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_(1993_film)">industrial music.</a> But what resonates with me even more is when Hughes and her colleagues note how alternative culture uses morbid imagery and content in a self-aware, playful and even deflationary way. For instance, they may be dark, but the songs on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Infirmary">From Here to Infirmary</a> by punk/emo band Alkaline Trio, are as wry as the title. Talking about ugly or dangerous thoughts can put them into perspective, and to laugh at it can banish it. As we’ve reported before, there is evidence that having heavy metal in your life <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/04/the-scaremongers-were-wrong-metalheads-from-the-80s-are-thriving/">can actually be a protective factor</a>.</p>
<p>Based on their current research review, Hughes and her team conclude that “there is currently not adequate evidence to draw conclusions that these alternative subcultures themselves are in any way harmful.” But being a member is associated with elevated risks, some of which accrue over time, which is enough of a reason to give it our attention. This could be through addressing stigmatisation; providing education for people who work with youth from these groups about warning signs and routes for accessing support; and providing psychology services that appeal to people who may be anti-establishment in temperament, but who could do with help in processing what they need to sort through.</p>
