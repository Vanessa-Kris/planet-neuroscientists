              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/penis-worms-hermit-lifestyle-crab-shells">‘Penis worms’ may have been the original hermits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hermit crabs have been taking shelter in abandoned shells for millions of years, but scientists now have evidence suggesting that the “hermit” lifestyle has existed far longer than that.</p>



<p>Besides hermit crabs, a few modern-day species of crustaceans and worms inhabit the cast-off shells of other marine creatures, mostly for protection against predators, says Martin Smith, a paleontologist at Durham University in England. Until recently, the oldest known fossils suggesting hermiting behavior were about 170 million years old, he says.</p>



<p>Now, Smith and his colleagues say that they have unearthed fossils of hermiting creatures almost three times that age, from a geologic period dubbed the Cambrian.</p>



<p>Remains of the ancient squatters were preserved in rocks laid down as seafloor sediments about 500 million years ago in what is now southern China. The cone-shaped shells that seem to hold the occupants probably had belonged to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-oddball-invertebrate-finds-its-place-tree-life">hyoliths</a>, a once-common group of ancient marine invertebrates that died out more than 250 million years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>The marine creatures that then took shelter in those vacant shells, the researchers say, belong to a group called priapulid worms — commonly known as penis worms, thanks to their suggestive body shape. &nbsp;The Chinese rocks contain dozens of empty shells, Smith says. But <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01357-9">four of those shells appear to have been inhabited by penis worms</a>, he and his colleagues report November 8 in <em>Current Biology.</em> Because there were no free-ranging priapulids preserved in the ancient sediments, the researchers propose that the worms were living inside the shells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="416" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline.jpg" alt="image of a fossilized penis worm in a shell" class="wp-image-3105534" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline-626x383.jpg 626w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline-304x186.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105534">Fossils of penis worms seemingly occupying the empty shells of another marine creature (one shown) suggest that the “hermiting” lifestyle existed about 330 million years earlier than scientists had realized.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105534">Xi-guang Zhang/Yunnan University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A relatively consistent ratio between the size of a worm and the shell it was preserved within suggests that the animals picked a shell based on its size and then moved to another when they outgrew their adopted home, Smith says. Modern-day hermit crabs use the same strategy, though none of the 20 species of penis worms around today have this hermiting behavior.</p>



<p>The researchers “have made some good observations to support their claims” that the association between the shells and the penis worms isn’t merely fortuitous, says Jakob Vinther, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England who wasn’t involved in the research. It’s not clear, however, whether the priapulids carried the shells from place to place, like hermit crabs do, or whether the animals merely lived inside them, he says.</p>



<p>A great variety of creatures — including most of the major groups of animals alive today and a proliferation of predators — evolved rapidly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-fossil-cache-cambrian-explosion">during the Cambrian Period</a>, which began about 542 million years ago (<em>SN: 3/21/19</em>). As a result, many researchers refer to that explosion of diversity as “life’s Big Bang.”</p>



<p>“Perhaps it’s not a surprise that some priapulids became hermits when you think about what this predatory arms race was all about: eating, ducking and hiding,” Vinther says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Early in the pandemic, there was a rapid shift in the pace of research. With the situation evolving quickly, lockdowns coming into effect, and the massive loss of life that followed, researchers across academia were racing against the clock to produce papers.</p>



<p>This haste was unusual for most scientists, more used to detailed scrutiny, further investigations, and collaboration. As a result, some were concerned about the rigour of papers that would ultimately see the light of day. Early on, psychologist <a href="https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20">Vaughan Bell tweeted</a> with regards to Covid research, &#8220;If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right&#8221;. Now, almost two years into the pandemic, we can begin to assess how robust our efforts were, and see where developments are leading us.</p>



<span id="more-44455"></span>



<p><strong>An imperfect world</strong><br>There is no escaping the fact that some initial fears about the quality of Covid research (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3dx8t227">mentioned in our May 2020 piece</a>) did come to pass. It was always going to be the case that an expedited timeline, as well as the torrent of Covid-related papers — some estimates have it at over 200,000 papers in 2020 — would bend traditional publication frameworks to breaking point.</p>



<p>As early as August 2020, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395946/">systematic review by Inés Nieto and colleagues</a>&nbsp;highlighted that while the majority of mental health research pertaining to Covid did report the expected statistical and methodological information, the reliance on convenience samples, lack of power analyses, and lack of pre-registration called into question both their generalisability and validity.</p>



<p>And this was not by any means an issue unique to psychology. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21220-5">systematic review from February 2021</a>, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, looked at the quality of published research on Covid during 2020 compared to papers from before the pandemic began. When compared with non-Covid articles published in the same journal before the pandemic, Covid papers generally achieved lower quality scores. They were also subject to substantially shorter turnaround times; on average, Covid papers had just 13 days from submission to acceptance, as opposed to a typical 110 days for pre-pandemic papers. Out of the 686 articles on Covid included in their systematic evaluation, Covid research generally achieved modest methodological quality scores, though low journal impact score and rapid turnarounds in particular were in many cases associated with significantly lower methodological quality.</p>



<p>The sheer speed at which research moved did lead to some questionable papers slipping through the net of peer review. As Michael Scheeringa notes in a blog post for&nbsp;<em>Psychology Today</em>, some researchers from outside of psychological disciplines also tried their hand at psychological research to varying success. Others from within psychological disciplines swiftly drew tenuous links between their work and Covid to ride the wave to swift publications and impact. Retraction Watch currently lists over 160 Covid papers that have been withdrawn or retracted from journals, many of which fall within the boundaries of cognitive sciences. What’s more, even though these papers were retracted, the potential damage done by many of the questionable findings within them continues. Thanks to other researchers scooping up Covid research as soon as possible, many will have already been cited in other articles before they were caught and retracted, leading to a proliferation of inaccuracies.</p>



<p>This particular problem spread beyond just peer reviewed work. In an effort to overcome delays imposed by peer review, masses of pre-prints were uploaded to repositories. And while this increased speed and access to novel findings, it also resulted in unchecked studies being treated similarly to peer-reviewed articles, and risky citations by both scientists and media. Tweaks that would come about during review were undoubtedly lost in many cases, which may prove difficult to correct in the coming months. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, even though typical research and publication frameworks bent and broke in some places, that doesn’t mean that we dropped the ball — rather, the urgency with which we needed to move superseded the risk of letting a percentage of imperfect papers see the light of day. In an ideal world, every Covid-related paper would have been immaculate. But researchers are human, and the situation was unprecedented in the truest sense of the word. This is important to remember as we turn attention to how we managed to rapidly reconfigure our research processes into systems that met the moment.</p>



<p><strong>Organised efforts</strong><br>In the wake of social distancing, formats such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194880/">letters to the editor</a> and social media (particularly Twitter) became powerful ways to spotlight areas in need of urgent research and organise efforts to rapidly fill those gaps. For example, the <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/october-2020/massive-collaboration">Psychological Science Accelerator</a> — a distributed network of labs that collaborate on studies to increase the generalisability of findings on chosen research projects — quickly created the Rapid Response Covid-19 Project, creating calls for collaboration via social media. The three chosen projects focus on loss gain, cognitive reappraisal, and self determination. As of writing, all have been <a href="https://psysciacc.org/2021/09/30/news-from-the-accelerator-september-2021/">submitted for peer review</a>, and the study on cognitive reappraisal has been published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01173-x"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>.</p>



<p>In a commendable move, several large journals, including Elsevier, also made all of their Covid-related publications Open Access. This effectively removed institutional access barriers from those seeking to contribute to Covid efforts, and reduced access issues caused by working from home. And in response to the tidal wave of pre-prints, many repositories got pickier about the types of submissions they allow in order to ensure things that absolutely required peer review (such as predictions about potential treatments) received it.</p>



<p>Following the flurry of papers in early 2020 that focused on the spread of Covid, research on the mental health impacts of the pandemic have more recently taken centre stage. According to analyses in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>, from November 2020, papers on mental health and Covid outpaced PubMed publication rates from other disciplines such as public health, diagnostics, and even epidemiology.</p>



<p>Valuable psychological insights, new issues, and new approaches have begun to emerge from the chaos. Several topics are likely to be of great relevance in the coming years, both for clinicians and academics. Here are just a few of those research topics that we are beginning to cover in more depth now that some of the dust is settling.</p>



<p><strong>Brain fog</strong><br>Following Covid recovery, many people report experiencing a wide array of extended symptoms, which have collectively been dubbed Long Covid. Many of these symptoms are neuropsychological, and while theories exist as to what may be causing these symptoms, no single mechanism has been agreed upon yet.</p>



<p>One of the more widespread and under-supported cognitive consequences of Long Covid is brain fog. Though it is not a diagnosis in itself, the condition is widely recognised by medical professionals, poses severe issues for those going through chemotherapy, and is prevalent among those with HIV, as well as other conditions. Despite this, misinformed associations between brain fog and malingering persist in the general population, creating extensive barriers to treatment.</p>



<p>To illustrate the difficulties faced by those suffering from post-Covid brain fog, researchers based at Oxford University&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.21261740v1">recently published a qualitative study</a>&nbsp;which takes a detailed look at brain fog sufferers’ lived experiences. Recruiting via online support groups, the discussions participants had during small focus groups detail the life changing impacts of cognitive impairment, from difficulties completing the weekly shop to extensive struggles with dismissive healthcare professionals. Several experienced issues conducting their jobs, and while some recovered over the course of the study, many did not, suggesting this may become a widespread longstanding issue for both patients and healthcare professionals going forward.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350">research suggesting</a> that around 81% of those with Long Covid may experience brain fog, there is an urgent need for specialised health and support services that are easily navigable by those suffering from the symptoms of brain fog, such as extremely low energy, confusion, and poor memory, to name a few.</p>



<p><strong>Transitioning from the ICU</strong><br>Through the course of the pandemic, there have been thousands of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions within the UK. A large number of these were older individuals, as may be expected, but a remarkable number were also younger, generally healthy individuals. For all patients, the shock of being admitted to ICU and their experiences while being treated are extreme, and for many can make readjusting to everyday life a struggle. Some researchers have wondered whether Post-Intensive Care Syndrome may pose a &#8220;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350">crisis after a crisis</a>&#8220;. Cognitive deficits and mood disorders are common in those who survive the ICU, with 47% suffering from depression or anxiety even two years post-ICU. Social factors stemming from physical injuries, such as financial instability or changes in identity may exacerbate this further in times of Covid.</p>



<p>Though research in this area with regards to Covid is still somewhat immature, psychologists such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301100/">Adam Guck and colleagues</a>&nbsp;have drawn from extensive existing literature on the psychological consequences of ICU stays with different diseases to create a probable list of psychological issues Covid patients may face post-ICU.</p>



<p>Using existing publications on Covid, SARS, MERS, conditions requiring ventilation, and other considerable medical interventions, the team identified five broad areas of issues that commonly occur in post-ICU patients: medical trauma and post-traumatic stress, cognitive deficits, fatigue and depression, social stress and readjustment, and illness anxiety. Combining this with their own observations, the authors then provide treatment recommendations for each of these areas, with emphasis on those that can be delivered as outpatient or telemedical interventions.</p>



<p>These sorts of recommendations are a promising start, and several academics highlight the need for future research to verify the efficacy of suggested approaches, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and diaphragmatic breathing, in Covid populations. It may be the case that cognitive behavioural therapy’s effect may be lessened by cognitive difficulties particular to Covid recovery, or that typical breathing exercises may draw attention to negative emotions or lasting physical effects concerning the respiratory system. Similarly, ensuring that therapies are effective across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will be vital to the world’s recovery from Covid.</p>



<p><strong>Prolonged Grief Disorder</strong><br>Millions of families around the world have been faced with the sudden death of loved ones due to Covid. Beyond this tragedy, the shock of these losses, combined in part with the disruption of typical death and mourning rituals, appears to have given rise to Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD).</p>



<p>PGD is a condition recently added to the DSM and ICD in response to ongoing mass death due to Covid, as well as other natural disasters and wars. Those with the condition experience bereavement difficulties which persist or grow, rather than diminishing over time, and can remain indefinitely without treatment.</p>



<p>Pre-Covid prevalence estimates sit at around 10 to 20% for the recently bereaved. However, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263919392_Prolonged_Grief_Disorder_Diagnostic_Assessment_and_Treatment_Considerations">some initial estimates</a> of PGD’s prevalence during the pandemic within <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-021-00669-5">Chinese populations</a> place this figure much higher. Using online versions of the International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale and the Traumatic Grief Inventory Self Report, researchers Suqin Tang and Zhendong Xiang assessed grief in 422 Chinese participants who had recently lost a loved one to Covid. From this, they were able to arrive at an estimate that between 29 and 38% of participants were experiencing symptoms of PGD.</p>



<p>Study of this condition is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to establish its prevalence, factors associated with Covid that may be making it more prevalent — such as fear or disrupted mourning practices — and how it may vary between cultures. But, given the potentially high prevalence of PGD brought on by the pandemic, combined with the sheer number of people requiring support from bereavement services, continued attention should be paid to this sector.</p>



<p><strong>Towards the future</strong><br>Though it’s still too early to assess the quality of recent months’ research as a whole, several different psychological topics that still require urgent insights, such as the above, are emerging. This small list is by no means exhaustive; questions remain about Covid’s long term impacts on both physical and mental health, and it’s likely that new issues will come to light in the coming years.</p>



<p>The pandemic has shifted the ways in which we collaborate, and thoroughly tested the processes guarding the gates to publication. Efforts of the research community over the last two years of the pandemic have been incredible, and have helped us get our feet on the ground. From here, it’s unclear how quickly we’ll need to move in order to keep pace with Covid developments. However, it’s likely that the lessons we’ve learned in how to organise effectively and research as quickly as possible will help us return to some sort of normality when it comes to Covid research in the near future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-choose">How to choose a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been a little over six months since I got my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and a phone call from my state health department over the weekend reminded me that I am eligible for a booster. But do I really need to get a third COVID-19 shot? If so, which of the three authorized or approved vaccines available in the United States should I get? To make my decision, I looked at the evidence and talked to some experts. What I found out could be useful to anyone deciding on a booster.</p>



<p>Let’s start with Johnson &amp; Johnson. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">Everyone who got that shot as their initial vaccine is recommended to get a booster</a>, U.S. health officials and experts say (<em>SN</em>: 10/19/21). That’s because the antibody response from that one-dose vaccine isn’t as high as for the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, and it is waning. “It doesn’t go away entirely,” says Sachin Nagrani, medical director of Heal, a company that provides primary health care in people’s homes via telehealth visits and house calls. But a few months after the J&amp;J shot, “it seems like your immune response is less protective.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are few studies on J&amp;J boosters, but the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">AstraZeneca vaccine</a>, which is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">built on similar technology</a> but not available in the United States, could provide some clues (<em>SN: 11/23/20; SN: 2/27/21</em>). Both vaccines use adenoviruses to deliver DNA instructions for building the coronavirus’s spike protein to cells. Studies show combining AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine with a boost from the Pfizer shot (or sometimes Moderna) was more effective than getting another dose of AstraZeneca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in Sweden, a double dose of AstraZeneca was about 50 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness. But AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer was 67 percent effective and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776221002350?via%3Dihub#!">AstraZeneca boosted with Moderna was 79 effective</a>, researchers reported October 18 in the <em>Lancet Regional Health &#8211; Europe</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A preliminary study that mixed and matched vaccines in the United States found that people who got J&amp;J as their first dose developed much higher levels of antibodies if their second dose was an mRNA vaccine than if it was another jab of J&amp;J. Those data suggest that people who got vaxxed with J&amp;J should consider getting an mRNA booster.</p>



<p>For people like me who got an mRNA vaccine in the first go-around, choosing a booster is a bit more complicated. Boosters are recommended for people 65 and older, but I’m younger than that. People who have a high chance of getting exposed to COVID-19 through their jobs or living situations can also get a booster. But right now I work from home, where just my husband and I live. People with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe disease are also eligible. I do have a couple of health conditions that make me more vulnerable. But how much more benefit would I get from a booster shot than from the two doses I already received?</p>



<p>Much of what we know about mRNA booster shots comes from data collected in Israel, where everyone 12 and older has been eligible for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine since the end of August. People who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine and had no underlying health risks, had a very low chance of developing severe COVID-19 or needing to be admitted to a hospital: Just <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736(21)02249-2">3.1 of every 100,000 healthy people</a> who had gotten two doses of vaccine got severe disease, researchers reported October 29 in the <em>Lancet</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with underlying health risks, that number started to climb. Of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people with one or two health risks, 82 developed severe disease. And with three or more health risks, the rate was 113 of every 100,000 people. Getting a booster dropped the severe disease rate for those with one or two health conditions to 3.2 per 100,000 and cut the rate by a bit more than half — to 51.6 per 100,000 — for those with three or more health conditions. That evidence leads me to think a booster is in order for me.</p>



<p>For young, healthy people the risk equation may be different. Nagrani says it’s OK for people in that situation to wait a while for more data on the vaccine’s longevity before getting a booster. But people 65 and older and those with health conditions or who live in assisted-living facilities should probably get a booster now.</p>



<p>The next question is which shot should I get? It’s now fine to mix and match vaccine doses for booster shots. I could stick with Pfizer, or switch to Moderna or J&amp;J. The first thing I’m considering is: What’s my goal? While I would like to not get infected with COVID-19 at all, that’s maybe not so realistic. None of the COVID-19 vaccines produce “sterilizing immunity,” which protects you from getting infected. But they all provide protection against illness.</p>

<p>At first glance, it looks as if the mRNA vaccines are the way to go, but I’ve been intrigued by discussions in the recent advisory board meetings for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about different types of immunity produced by the vaccines. The mRNA vaccines give gangbuster levels of neutralizing antibodies, which help keep the coronavirus from infecting cells. But adenovirus-based vaccines like J&amp;J’s and AstraZeneca’s seem to be better at revving up long-lasting protection from immune cells called T cells. And some evidence suggests that a combo of an mRNA vaccine with an adenovirus-based vaccine like J&amp;J’s could have some advantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a study in France, participants got either two doses of the Pfizer vaccine or a dose of AstraZeneca with a Pfizer chaser. People who got <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04120-y">Pfizer for both doses were twice as likely to get infected </a>with the coronavirus as those who got the mixed doses, researchers reported October 21 in <em>Nature</em>. That was 10 infections among the 2,512 (0.39 percent) who got the mixed doses, compared with 81 infections among the 10,609 people (0.76 percent) who got Pfizer alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I asked one of that study’s coauthors, Jacqueline Marvel, an immunologist at the International Center for Infectious Disease Research (CIRI) in Lyon, France, about whether I should switch to J&amp;J for my booster shot to give my T cells a lift or stick with an mRNA vaccine. “I’m not sure you want to change the vaccine just for increasing the T cell response,” she said. That answer surprised me a little because Marvel studies T cells for a living.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m pro T cell,” she said. But “neutralizing antibodies are what you want to have first. The antibodies stop the virus from getting into the cells and protect you much earlier than the T cells would,” Marvel explained. “If people don’t want to be ill and have symptoms, you want the antibodies.” And to maximize antibodies, the mRNA vaccines are the way to go.</p>



<p>Side effects from the booster doses are similar to those experienced from earlier doses, though some data suggest the effects after a booster may be milder than after the second dose. Some people are worried about rare side effects such as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, that has sometimes happened after an mRNA dose, particularly for young males after the second dose. But that side effect is uncommon: Just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">17 out of 2.5 million people who got a Pfizer booster shot in Israel developed myocarditis</a> or pericarditis, Israeli health officials reported (<em>SN</em>: 10/19/21). I’m not a young man and my first two doses produced only a sore arm, so side effects aren’t a big concern for me.</p>



<p>All of this convinced me to get an mRNA shot. But which one? That decision came down to convenience. I got online and searched for places where I could get my booster. It turns out that few of the grocery stores, pharmacies or other vaccine providers in my area offer the Moderna vaccine (even fewer have the J&amp;J shot), but Pfizer doses are plentiful. So I got a Pfizer booster in my right arm and a flu vaccine in the left. (It’s safe to take both at the same time.) According to the CDC, I’m not alone. Almost <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total">99 percent of people fully vaccinated with Pfizer also chose Pfizer for their booster</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My arms might ache for a little while, but that’s a price I’m more than willing to pay to avoid severe illness for myself and to help protect those around me from getting infected.</p>

                <p>Global temperatures are rising and so, it seems, is part of the sky.</p>



<p>Atmosphere readings collected by weather balloons in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 40 years reveal that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi8065?_ga=2.49013606.1705142086.1635777718-1312948397.1634132513">climate change is pushing the upper boundary of the troposphere</a> — the slice of sky closest to the ground — steadily upward at a rate of 50 to 60 meters per decade, researchers report November 5 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Temperature is the driving force behind this change, says Jane Liu, an environmental scientist at the University of Toronto. The troposphere varies in height around the world, reaching as high as 20 kilometers in the tropics and as low as seven kilometers near the poles. During the year, the upper boundary of the troposphere — called the tropopause — naturally rises and falls with the seasons as air expands in the heat and contracts in the cold. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">as greenhouse gases trap more and more heat in the atmosphere</a>, the troposphere is expanding higher into the atmosphere (<em>SN: 10/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>Liu and her colleagues found that the tropopause rose an average of about 200 meters in height from 1980 to 2020. Nearly all weather occurs in the troposphere, but it’s unlikely that this shift will have on a big effect on weather, the researchers say. Still, this research is an important reminder of the impact of climate change on our world, Liu says.</p>



<p>“We see signs of global warming around us, in retreating glaciers and rising sea levels,” she says. “Now, we see it in the height of the troposphere.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Meat consumption has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/08/cuts-uk-meat-consumption-doubled-health-researchers-food">decreased by 17%</a> in the UK over the past decade, with more and more people questioning the health, environmental and moral implications of eating meat. While some will be unrepentant about their taste for meat, others may find it more morally ambiguous, with big questions about how justifiable their diets really are.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211041536">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, takes a closer look at how meat-eaters grapple with these quandaries. It finds that blaming third parties, holding them responsible for moral transgressions, can reduce the cognitive dissonance involved in eating meat.</p>



<span id="more-44412"></span>



<p>In the first study, 310 American meat-eating participants were randomly assigned to read a newspaper article depicting the animal abuse prevalent in factory farming. The article described the lack of space, lack of fresh air, deprivation of natural behaviours and slaughter that occurs in factory farming. In one condition, participants read that the factory farms were based in the US, while in the other that the farms were in China.</p>



<p>After finishing the article, half of the participants in each group were able to express moral outrage at the factory farm owners and operators by agreeing or disagreeing with statements such as “knowing that animals are helpless against factory farming companies makes me angry on their behalf”. They then reported how guilty they felt about the treatment of these animals, and rated their own moral character, relative to other people, on a scale from one to five. The other half of participants proceeded to these measures without articulating any outrage.</p>



<p>For those who did not have the opportunity to express moral outrage, guilt was higher and ratings of their own moral character were lower when they read that their “in-group” — i.e. other Americans — were responsible for the factory farms. But for those who <em>did</em> express moral outrage, there was no difference in guilt or perceived moral standing whether they had read about American or Chinese factory farms, suggesting that blaming others can decrease feelings of responsibility and moral culpability. A second study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In a third and final study, the team investigated whether highlighting the harms associated with eating meat would also encourage meat-eaters to express outrage towards other, unrelated acts of animal abuse. A total of 300 participants were once again assigned to one of two conditions. In order to provoke feelings of defensiveness around eating meat, those in the &#8220;meat threat&#8221; condition read an article detailing the harms meat eating inflicts on both the environment and the global poor. Those in the other condition did not read an article at this point.</p>



<p>Next, all participants read an article describing the abuse of dolphins in SeaWorld as well as viewing pictures of the abuse. Half of the participants were then asked to briefly describe something about themselves that made them feel like a good person, while the other half described their preference between Mac and Dell computers. Finally, participants reported their moral outrage towards SeaWorld.</p>



<p>Among those participants who had read the article provoking defensiveness, moral outrage towards SeaWorld was much lower if they subsequently affirmed themselves as a good person than if they did not complete the affirmation task. For those who hadn’t read the initial article, affirmation had no impact on expressed moral outrage.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that expressing outrage at factory farming or other animal abuses acts as a way to repair moral self-image. This could assuage people’s guilt about eating meat — but if guilt is mitigated in such a way, people may feel “even more emboldened to consume meat”, the authors suggest.</p>



<p>The team suggests that future research could focus on campaigns designed to “delegitimize the belief that voicing displeasure at one injustice grants moral capital to participate in others”. Used in conjunction with other interventions — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/03/even-some-meat-eaters-are-disgusted-by-meat-and-encouraging-those-feelings-could-help-reduce-consumption/">harnessing disgust</a>, to use one example — this could go some way to increasing the number of people cutting down on meat.</p>

<p><strong>Learning and memory transfer: More experimental evidence </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/learning-and-memory-transfer-more-experimental-evidence"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 6, 1971</p>



<p>The first memory molecule has been isolated, characterized and synthesized … [from the brains of] rats that had been shocked in the dark…. It is a protein and dubbed “scotophobin,” after the Greek words for “fear of the dark.” [One researcher] has injected synthetic rat scotophobin into the brains of hundreds of goldfish. While the fish indeed exhibited fear of the dark and resisted learning to swim into the dark, the fear was of brief duration.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The idea that scotophobin stores memories and can be used to transfer them between organisms was met with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11730861_Georges_Ungar_and_memory_transfer">intense skepticism</a> and was eventually discredited by neuroscientists. But the search for a physical basis of memory continues. Over the last few decades, other memory molecule candidates have popped up, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enzyme-revives-long-term-memories">a protein called PKM-zeta</a>, which may help with memory retrieval, and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-injected-one-sea-slug-another-may-transfer-memories">RNA</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 9</em>). Still, the dominant theory is that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memory-brain-engram-neuroscience">memories are stored in synapses</a>, connections between nerve cells in the brain (<em>SN: 2/3/18, p. 22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-nervous-system-brain-cells-digest-feed">Brainless sponges contain early echoes of a nervous system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brains are like sponges, slurping up new information. But sponges may also be a little bit like brains.</p>



<p>Sponges, which are humans’ very distant evolutionary relatives, don’t have nervous systems. But a detailed analysis of sponge cells turns up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abj2949">what might just be an echo of our own brains</a>: cells called neuroids that crawl around the animal’s digestive chambers and send out messages, researchers report in the Nov. 5 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding not only gives clues about the early evolution of more complicated nervous systems, but also raises many questions, says evolutionary biologist Thibaut Brunet of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is just the beginning,” he says. “There’s a lot more to explore.”</p>



<p>The cells were lurking in <em>S</em><em>pongilla lacustris</em>, a freshwater sponge that grows in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. “We jokingly call it the Godzilla of sponges” because of the rhyme with <em>Spongilla</em>, say Jacob Musser, an evolutionary biologist in Detlev Arendt’s group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>



<p>Simple as they are, these sponges have a surprising amount of complexity, says Musser, who helped pry the sponges off a metal ferry dock using paint scrapers. “They’re such fascinating creatures.”</p>

<p>With sponges procured, Arendt, Musser and colleagues looked for genes active in individual sponge cells, ultimately arriving at a list of 18 distinct kinds of cells, some known and some unknown. Some of these cells used genes that are essential to more evolutionarily sophisticated nerve cells for sending or receiving messages in the form of small blobs of cellular material called vesicles.</p>



<p>One such cell, called a neuroid, caught the scientists’ attention. After seeing that this cell was using those genes involved in nerve cell signaling, the researchers took a closer look. A view through a confocal microscope turned up an unexpected locale for the cells, Musser says. “We realized, ‘My God, they’re in the digestive chambers.’”</p>



<p>Large, circular digestive structures called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/possible-ancestor-sponges-found">choanocyte chambers</a> help move water and nutrients through sponges’ canals, in part by beating hairlike cilia appendages (<em>SN: 3/9/15</em>). Neuroids were hovering around some of these cilia, the researchers found, and some of the cilia near neuroids were bent at angles that suggested that they were no longer moving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="423" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg" alt="a purple neuroid cell next to an aqua digestive cell" class="wp-image-3105495" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-680x359.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-330x174.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-768x406.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105495">A neuroid cell (colored purple in this electron micrograph image) gets close to a digestive cell (aqua) in a sponge’s feeding chamber. This proximity offers the chance for the neuroid to send signals to the other cell, scientists say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105495">Jacob Musser, Giulia Mizzon, Constantin Pape, Nicole Schieber/EMBL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team suspects that these neuroids were sending signals to the cells charged with keeping the sponge fed, perhaps using vesicles to stop the movement of usually undulating cilia. If so, that would be a sophisticated level of control for an animal without a nervous system.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that sponges are using bits and bobs of communications systems that ultimately came together to work as brains of other animals. Understanding the details might provide clues to how nervous systems evolved. “What did animals have, before they had a nervous system?” Musser asks. “There aren’t many organisms that can tell us that. Sponges are one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-science-next-10-years-decadal-survey">Here’s what the next 10 years of space science could look like</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey is basically a sneak preview of the next 10 years of U.S. space science. Every decade, experts assembled by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine collect input from astronomers nationwide to recommend a prioritized list of projects to policy makers and federal agencies. Past to-do lists have been topped by specific big-ticket items, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/celestial-wish-list">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: </em><em>10/6/21; SN: 8/13/10</em>). But this year, astronomers are shaking things up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/26141">latest decadal survey</a>, which charts the course for U.S. astronomy and astrophysics from 2022 to 2032, recommends that NASA create a new program to develop several major space telescopes at a time. Investing early in multiple mission concepts could curb the risk of individual missions becoming too unwieldy and expensive, according to the report released November 4.</p>



<p>“These are super important recommendations,” says Scott Gaudi, an astronomer at the Ohio State University who wasn’t on the National Academies committee that compiled the report. “They really focus the direction of astronomy in the United States — and sort of by extension the rest of the world, because we have lots of international partnerships.”</p>



<p>The proposed multi-mission program would reshape how major space missions are planned. In the past, “you would pick a priority, you’d build it, you’d launch it, and then you would think about what the next priority was,” says Jonathan Fortney, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a member of the survey committee.</p>





<p>But space telescopes are getting more ambitious, complex and expensive, Fortney says. The one-at-a-time model doesn’t work so well when a single mission can take decades from blueprint to blastoff.</p>



<p>Having several big projects in the works offers a bit of insurance. If researchers work on one mission for a few years and realize that the technology isn’t there to make it fly on time, NASA could switch gears and send another telescope to space first, Fortney says. Developing multiple missions in parallel could also shrink the long wait time between launches.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited by that. It’s like the best possible outcome,” Gaudi says. This setup could boost confidence that big space missions can stay on budget and on schedule, he adds, after the large cost overruns and delays that have mired the long-awaited James Webb Space Telescope. “It is a really new way of approaching things, and one that’s really needed to advance astronomy into the next few decades.”</p>



<p>The first mission in the new program, according to the survey report, should be a space telescope that views the universe in infrared, optical and ultraviolet wavelengths, filling a gap left by other instruments. The Hubble Space Telescope mainly looks at optical and ultraviolet light, while the James Webb telescope will primarily see the universe in infrared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg" alt="illustration of the James Webb Space Telescope" class="wp-image-3105486" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg 714w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-608x383.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-295x186.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-920x580.jpg 920w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105486">Astronomers’ top-ranked priority in the 2001 decadal survey, the James Webb Space Telescope (illustrated), is finally slated to launch in December.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105486">Northrop Grumman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>With a light-collecting area more than twice as wide as Hubble’s, this newfangled observatory could glimpse planets in other star systems that are a tenth of a billionth as bright as their stars, and could tease out the specific wavelengths of light, or spectra, given off by exoplanets. The telescope could also observe stars, galaxies and other celestial objects. With an estimated price tag of $11 billion, the telescope would be slated to launch in the early 2040s.</p>



<p>Five years after starting work on that first flagship mission, NASA should begin developing both a far-infrared mission and an X-ray mission, each costing an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion, the survey recommends.</p>



<p>A far-infrared window into the universe could help astronomers study how water behaves in forming planetary systems, Fortney says. A successor to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-chandra-x-ray-telescope-celebrates-20-years-space">NASA’s 22-year-old Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> could reveal new details of galaxy evolution, supermassive black hole behavior and other energetic phenomena (<em>SN: 7/25/19</em>).</p>



<p>On the ground, astronomers’ highest priorities, according to the decadal survey, are continuing to build two major optical observatories, the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii — though the latter project has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-mauna-kea-opened-astronomy-controversy">faced controversy</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>).</p>



<p>The survey also notes that it is time to replace the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the Very Long Baseline Array of telescope dishes scattered across the United States. The proposed successor to these world-class radio observatories is the Next-Generation Very Large Array, which would be 10 times as sensitive.</p>



<p>Fortney is optimistic that NASA and other federal agencies will make the decadal survey’s top-ranked priorities a reality. “The record has been quite good, in terms of the most prominent recommendations being born out,” he says. “I have really high confidence that these things really will happen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">Massive Study Finds No Link Between Time Spent Playing Video Games And Wellbeing</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Video games are perhaps one of the most politicised forms of entertainment media out there. In the decades since they were first created, governments, politicians, health bodies and beyond have voiced concerns that the amount of time some players spend in these virtual worlds could be detrimental to their mental health.</p>



<p>Despite all this concern, there’s been a lack of high-quality research into the effect of video games on player wellbeing. To remedy this situation, Matti Vuorre and colleagues at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with several large game publishers such as Nintendo and Square Enix, conducted an ambitious longitudinal study. These fears, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8cxyh">they conclude in their recent preprint</a> on <em>PsyArXiv</em>, are unfounded.</p>



<span id="more-44390"></span>



<p>In order to investigate whether longer play times had an impact on player wellbeing, the team recruited a massive 38,935 players of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Apex Legends, Eve Online, Forza, Gran Turismo, Outriders</em>, and <em>The Crew 2</em>. Recruitment emails for this study targeted specifically English-speaking players from several countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of six weeks, players were asked to answer three &#8220;waves&#8221; of a survey, sent two weeks apart, containing measures of wellbeing and motivation. The first measure of wellbeing, a 13-point scale of positive and negative experiences (SPANE), asked participants how they had been feeling in the previous two weeks, and to rate how often they had experienced six positive and six negative feelings. The Cantril self-anchoring scale, in which participants rate their level of life satisfaction between 0 to 10, was also used to assess wellbeing.</p>



<p>Players were also asked to reflect on their experiences playing the game over the past two weeks, by filling in the player experience and need satisfaction scale (PENS), which included questions on feelings of autonomy, competence, relatedness (for example, with other players), as well as motivation. Finally, participants were asked to give an estimate of the time they’d spent playing the video game they were recruited through for the previous two weeks (the games’ publishers also provided the research team with each participant’s actual total playtimes for these two weeks).</p>



<p>Analyses looked at the relationship between hours played in one wave and wellbeing scores in the subsequent wave. Sifting through the data like this revealed that time spent playing these games had little to no apparent causal effect on wellbeing or life satisfaction. The effect was so small, the authors say, that if players went from their minimum play time to their maximum play time, their wellbeing scores would only shift by around 0.013 points on the SPANE scale. The impact on life satisfaction scores would be similarly tiny, shifting by just 0.02 points. These kinds of numbers are not indicative of any meaningful impact on wellbeing.</p>



<p>Switching these two factors around to look at the effect of feelings and life satisfaction on play time, the team found that a one-point increase on the SPANE scale of wellbeing would lead to a 0.01 hour per week increase in play time. Similarly, life satisfaction had essentially no impact on duration of play, suggesting that there is no causal relationship between wellbeing and time spent gaming.</p>



<p>In contrast, however, motivation to game was causally linked to wellbeing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when players wanted to engage with video games, they got a subsequent boost in feelings of wellbeing, whereas when they felt like they were playing through compulsion, those feelings dropped.</p>



<p>The span of game genres used in this study is rather wide — <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, for example, is a pastoral experience, which differs significantly from the high commitment, often high-pressure experience of <em>Eve Online</em>. Even so, there are many other genres which also merit investigation. Time spent playing mobile games, as well as those with microtransactions or addictive elements, may have different impacts on player wellbeing.</p>



<p>Sampling in this study, the authors say, may also have somewhat limited the validity of this result. Because participants were recruited through self-selection, people with particular traits or dispositions that made them more likely to be unaffected by lengthy gaming sessions may have been more likely to provide data. The age of participants — on average, 34 years old — may also limit the generalisability of these findings. It’s possible that as adults, these gamers have developed gaming habits that specifically do not affect their wellbeing, which may not be the case for younger players. And of course, these players were all English speakers, so it remains unclear whether there may be cultural differences in the strength of the relationship between gaming and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Despite these limitations, the results of this study stand as much needed preliminary evidence that time spent playing video games is not a threat to wellbeing. In the future, similarly robust research to confirm these findings in other age groups, as well as investigating the impact of specific gameplay features, will help push this research area forward.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8cxyh">Time spent playing video games is unlikely to impact well-being</a> [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-child-skull-hominid-cave-discovery">A child’s partial skull adds to the mystery of how Homo naledi treated the dead</a></h4>

              
                <p>A child’s partial skull found in a remote section of a South African cave system has fueled suspicion that an ancient hominid known as <em>Homo naledi</em> deliberately disposed of its dead in caves.</p>



<p>An international team led by paleoanthropologist Lee Berger of University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg pieced together 28 skull fragments and six teeth from a child’s skull discovered in a narrow opening located about 12 meters from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-new-species-human-genus">an underground chamber where cave explorers first found <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/15</em>). Features of the child’s skull qualify it as <em>H. naledi</em>, a species with an orange-sized brain and skeletal characteristics of both present-day people and <em>Homo</em> species from around 2 million years ago.</p>



<p>“The case is building for deliberate, ritualized body disposal in caves by <em>Homo naledi</em>,” Berger said at a November 4 news conference held in Johannesburg. While <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pieces-homo-naledi-story-continue-puzzle">that argument is controversial</a>, there is no evidence that the child’s skull was washed into the tiny space or dragged there by predators or scavengers (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Berger’s group describes the find in two papers published November 4 in <em>PaleoAnthropology. </em>In one, Juliet Brophy, a paleoanthropologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and colleagues <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/64">describe the youngster&#8217;s skull</a>. In the other, paleoanthropologist Marina Elliott of Canada’s Simon Fraser University in Burnaby and colleagues detail <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/68">new explorations in South Africa’s Rising Star cave system</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers nicknamed the new find Leti, short for a word in a local South African language that means “the lost one.” Leti likely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans">dates to the same time as other <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a>, between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>). Berger’s team suspects Leti died at about age 4 to 6 years based on the rate at which children grow today. But that’s a rough approximation as the scientists can’t yet say how fast <em>H. naledi</em> kids grew.</p>

<html><body><p>PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, November 4.</p>



<p>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that it is the first wholly Open Access (OA) publisher to deliver Release 5 COUNTER-compliant usage reporting to the library community. This is an important milestone in the development of usage reporting that meets the growing needs of the OA movement.</p>



<p>PLOS and LibLynx announced a partnership in 2020 to develop ground-breaking analytics that communicate the usage and impact of OA content to their stakeholder communities, and libraries in particular.&nbsp; The first phase of this initiative was to deliver COUNTER reports <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">to PLOS institutional partners</a> that enable them to understand their usage of PLOS OA content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a huge milestone for us. The development of next generation metrics for wholly-OA content is one of great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions, and we are delivering on that promise,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS.</p>



<p>&ldquo;COUNTER very much welcomes PLOS becoming a publisher compliant with the Code of Practice. Our consultations with the library community, our OA Advisory Group and ongoing workshops demonstrate a demand for COUNTER reports from fully OA publishers, as part of the evaluation of the return on investment associated with open access content,&rdquo; said Lorraine Estelle, Project Director, COUNTER.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We needed to develop custom processing logic that attributed OA usage to organizations based on their registered IP addresses in order to generate COUNTER reports for PLOS&rsquo; library community,&rdquo; said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having engaged with the community over the last year to better understand their reporting needs, PLOS and LibLynx are now working on the development of new, more flexible reporting tools to better understand usage and impact of OA content.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baleen-whales-eat-poop-more-food-ecosystem">Baleen whales eat (and poop) a lot more than we realized</a></h4>

              
                <p>Whalers have plucked giant whales from the sea for much of the last century, reducing their numbers by up to 99 percent for certain species. Some scientists thought that krill — the tiny crustaceans that many whales eat in gargantuan gulps — would explode in number as a result, mostly free from the feeding pressure of the largest animals that have ever lived.</p>



<p>But that didn’t happen. Instead, Antarctic krill numbers have dwindled since the mid-20th century, by more than 80 percent in areas heavily trafficked by whalers. Many other consumers of krill, like seabirds and fish, have suffered too in the absence of the crustaceans and their giant eaters.</p>



<p>Now, scientists have a clearer idea why this happened: whale poop, or rather, the lack of it.</p>



<p>A new study finds that baleen whales, including blue and humpback whales, eat on average <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03991-5">three times as much krill</a> and other food as previously thought, and more food in means more poop out. Paradoxically, the collapse of the krill may stem from fewer whales excreting iron-rich, digested krill, denying these ecosystems some crucial nutrients they need to thrive. Phytoplankton blooms, which sustain krill and many other parts of the food web, rely on that iron. Restoring whale populations to prewhaling levels could help bolster these ecosystems and even store more carbon in the ocean, researchers report in the Nov. 4 <em>Nature.</em></p>





<p>“It’s hard to know what role whales play in ecosystems without knowing how much they’re eating,” says Joe Roman, a marine ecologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington who wasn’t involved in the research. Whale food intake was coarsely understood before, he says, and this study will “allow us to better understand how the widespread depletion of whales has impacted ocean ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Assessing the precise diet of Boeing 737–sized creatures that gulp down hordes of centimeter-long invertebrates far below the surface of the ocean is not a trivial undertaking. Previous estimates relied on dissections of dead whales or inferring whales’ metabolic needs based on their size. “These studies were educated guesses, and none were conducted on live whales in the wild,” says Matthew Savoca, a marine biologist at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, Calif.</p>



<p>But new technology gave Savoca and colleagues “a chance to answer a really basic biological question about some of the most charismatic animals on earth.”</p>



<p>The researchers needed to know three things: how often whales feed, how big of gulps they take and how much food is in each gulp. Using sophisticated sensors suction-cupped to the backs of 321 individuals of seven whale species, the researchers could tell when the whales lunged for prey, a reliable sign of feeding. Aerial drones snapped photos of 105 whales, which the researchers used to estimate gulp size. Finally, sonar mapping revealed the density of krill in key feeding areas.</p>

<p>Combining these datasets together revealed a more detailed look at feeding than ever before, says Sarah Fortune, a marine ecologist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Winnipeg. Savoca and his colleagues “measured all the things you need to measure to get an accurate estimate of consumption,” for baleen whales, she says.</p>



<p>It turns out that, on average, baleen whales eat about three times as much food as earlier estimates suggested. For example, a blue whale can put down 16 metric tons of krill in a day, the researchers found. Energetically, that’s equivalent to around 10 million to 20 million calories, or about 30,000 Big Macs, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whales aren’t eating that much every day. The animals go for months without a bite when migrating vast distances. But the sheer volume of food that they consume, and then excrete, suggests that whales shape ocean ecosystems to a larger degree than previously thought, Savoca says, making their loss that much more impactful.</p>



<p>That’s because one role whales play is that of nutrient cycler. By feeding on iron-rich krill in the deep and returning some of that iron to the surface in the form of poop, whales help keep this crucial element in the food web. Excessive whaling might have broken this iron cycle. With less iron at the surface, phytoplankton blooms shrink, krill numbers crash and the ecosystem becomes less productive, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before industrial whaling <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-us-commercial-whaling-was-coming-to-an-end">killed millions of whales</a> in the 20th century, the researchers estimate that baleen whales in just the Southern Ocean alone, a key feeding area, consumed 430 million metric tons of krill each year, more than twice the biomass of all krill that’s found in those waters today (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>).&nbsp;Even with today’s diminished populations, researchers estimate that whales prevent approximately 1,200 metric tons of iron from being lost each year, left to drift down to the dark deep of the Southern Ocean.</p>



<p>Whales are likely not the only factor behind the staggering loss of krill, Savoca says, but the evidence suggests that “whales play a role here, and when you wholesale remove them, the system becomes, on average, less productive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">Some whale populations are rebounding</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>). If whales and krill could be brought back to their early 1900s numbers, the productivity of the Southern Ocean could be boosted by 11 percent, the researchers calculate. That increased productivity would translate into more carbon-rich bodies, from krill to blue whales, which together would store 215 million metric tons of carbon annually, the equivalent of taking more than <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">170 million cars</a> off the road for a year, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“Whales are not the solution to climate change,” Savoca says. “But rebuilding whale populations would help a sliver, and we need lots of slivers put together to solve the problem.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gold-heavy-elements-cosmos">Neutron star collisions probably make more gold than other cosmic smashups</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cosmic origins of elements heavier than iron are mysterious. One elemental birthplace came to light in 2017 when two neutron-rich dead stars collided and spewed out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">gold, platinum and other</a> hefty elements (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). A few years later, a smashup of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">another neutron star</a> and a black hole left scientists wondering which type of cosmic clash was the more prolific element foundry (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, they have an answer. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac26c6">Collisions of two neutron stars</a> probably take the cake, scientists report October 25 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>To create heavy elements after either type of collision, neutron star material must be flung into space, where a series of nuclear reactions called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dwarf-galaxy-was-heavy-element-factory">r-process</a> can transform the material (<em>SN: 4/22/16</em>).</p>



<p>How much material escapes into space, if any, depends on various factors. For example, in collisions of a neutron star and black hole, the black hole has to be relatively small, or “there’s no hope at all,” says astrophysicist Hsin-Yu Chen of MIT. “It’s going to swallow the neutron star right away,” without ejecting anything.</p>



<p>Questions remain about both types of collisions, spotted via the ripples in spacetime that they kick up. So Chen and colleagues considered a range of possibilities for the properties of neutron stars and black holes, such as the distributions of their masses and how fast they spin. The team then calculated the mass ejected by each type of collision under those varied conditions. In most scenarios, the neutron star–black hole mergers made a smaller quantity of heavy elements than the neutron star duos — in one case only about a hundredth the amount.</p>



<p>Still, the ultimate element factory ranking remains up in the air. The scientists compared just these two types of collisions, not other possible sources of heavy elements such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-explosion-hypernova-supernova-universe-heavy-elements-origin">exploding stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Self-control — or lack of it — can have a serious impact on our lives. Poor self-control can lead to feelings of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/02/poor-self-control-can-lead-to-feelings-of-loneliness/">loneliness</a>, while those with higher levels of self-discipline <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/06/people-with-strong-self-control-experience-less-intense-bodily-states-like-hunger-and-fatigue/">experience</a> states like hunger and tiredness less intensely. Yet despite these obvious benefits, the vast majority of us sometimes experience failures in self-control no matter how hard we try.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/35/e2018726118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, looks to quantify the cost of self-control. Candace M. Raio and Paul W. Glimcher from the New York University School of Medicine find that we’re willing to pay a monetary price to avoid having to exert self-control — and we’ll pay more if the temptation is particularly strong.</p>



<span id="more-44298"></span>



<p>In the first study, conducted in a lab, dieting participants started by indicating how healthy, tasty and tempting they found particular foods like crisps or chocolate brownies. They then reported how much of a $10 endowment they would be willing to pay to avoid having the highly tempting food placed immediately in front of them for half an hour. The tempting food was then placed in front of them, and the participant was given further opportunities to bid to have it replaced with a less tempting food.</p>



<p>Importantly, there was a small chance that each bid would go to auction, where it was compared against a random figure between $0 and $10: if the participants bid a higher amount, they would  have a low-tempting food placed in front of them for the remainder of the 30 minutes, but if they bid a lower amount, the highly tempting food would remain for the rest of the time.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants were prepared to pay on average 15% of the $10 to remove the temptation — and continued to bid a similar amount throughout the task, suggesting a sustained desire to have temptation removed. In total, 22% of participants consumed the highly tempting food.</p>



<p>The second study replicated the first — only this time, participants were told they would also lose a $15 bonus if they ate the tempting food. Again, the dieting participants showed a sustained willingness to pay to avoid temptation, bidding on average $2.85 out of their $10 endowment to have the food removed. Thus, they spent more money when the costs of not meeting their self-control goals were higher. Interestingly, with this penalty in place none of the participants presented with the highly tempting food consumed it.</p>



<p>In a third study, some participants were exposed to stress before the self-control task through the immersion of their hand into ice-cold water. These stressed participants were willing to pay more to avoid the tempting food compared to non-stressed participants, more than doubling the amount of money they put up. And in a final study, the team found that participants were willing to pay more to avoid highly tempting food versus food that was only a little tempting.</p>



<p>So, overall, dieting participants were willing to pay actual money in order to avoid exercising self-control in the face of temptation. This reinforces previous research that suggests that when faced with temptation we will attempt to avoid using cognitive resources like self-control as much as we possibly can, relying on different tactics instead. The results also suggest that we carefully weigh up the costs of exercising self-control and the costs of losing self-control, making active and rational decisions about when to give into temptation and what to sacrifice when doing so.</p>



<p>The study also offers interesting insights into &#8220;precommitment&#8221; — rather than being forced to face temptation and succeed, participants preferred to not be exposed to the risk of failure at all. This could be a useful strategy when trying to achieve goals (and is probably already well known to many dieters who remove snacks from their house rather than trying not to eat them).</p>



<p>Future research could look at what happens when people have to face temptation over an unknown time period: all participants in this particular study knew the maximum amount of time they would have to resist temptation, but something different may have happened if they had not had this information. Looking at non-financial costs people are willing to pay could also be enlightening, going some way to explain why we manage to resist temptation in some cases but not in others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-dark-side-image-atmosphere-ice-frost-charon">Pluto’s dark side reveals clues to its atmosphere and frost cycles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pluto’s dark side has come into dim view, thanks to the light of the dwarf planet’s moon.</p>



<p>When NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mission-pluto-live-coverage">flew past Pluto in 2015</a>, almost all the images of the dwarf planet’s unexpectedly complex surface were of the side illuminated by the sun (<em>SN: 7/15/15</em>). Darkness shrouded the dwarf planet’s other hemisphere. Some of it, like the area near the south pole, hadn’t seen the sun for decades.</p>



<p>Now, mission scientists have finally released a grainy <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac2743">view of the dwarf planet’s dark side</a>. The researchers describe the process to take the photo and what it tells them about how Pluto’s nitrogen cycle affects its atmosphere October 20 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Before New Horizons passed by Pluto, the team suspected the dwarf planet’s largest moon, Charon, might reflect enough light to illuminate the distant world’s surface. So the researchers had the spacecraft turn back toward the sun to take a parting peek at Pluto.</p>

<p>At first, the images just showed a ring of sunlight filtering through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-flows-haze-offer-more-clues-plutos-geology">Pluto’s hazy atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/15</em>). “It’s very hard to see anything in that glare,” says planetary scientist John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “It’s like trying to read a street sign when you’re driving toward the setting sun and you have a dirty windshield.”</p>



<p>Spencer and colleagues took a few steps to make it possible to pull details of Pluto’s dark side out of the glare. First, the team had the spacecraft take 360 short snapshots of the backlit dwarf planet. Each was about 0.4 seconds long, to avoid overexposing the images. The team also took snapshots of the sun without Pluto in the frame so that the sun could be subtracted out after the fact.</p>





<p>Tod Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., tried to process the images when he got the data in 2016. At the time, the rest of the data from New Horizons was still fresh and took up most of his attention, so he didn’t have the time to tackle such a tricky project.</p>



<p>But “it was something that just sat there and ate away at me,” Lauer says. He tried again in 2019. Because the spacecraft was moving as it took the images, each image was a little bit smeared or blurred. Lauer wrote a computer code to remove that blur from each individual frame. Then he added the reflected Charon light in each of those hundreds of images together to produce a single image.</p>





<p>“When Tod did that painstaking analysis, we finally saw something emerging in the dark there … giving us a little bit of a glimpse of what the dark pole of Pluto looks like,” Spencer says.</p>



<p>That the team got anything at all is impressive, says planetary scientist Carly Howett, also of the Southwest Research Institute and who is on the New Horizons team but was not involved in this work. “This dataset is really, really hard to work with,” she says. “Kudos to this team. I wouldn’t have wanted to do this.”</p>



<p>The image, Howett says, can help scientists understand how Pluto’s frigid nitrogen atmosphere varies with its decades-long seasons. Pluto’s atmosphere is controlled by how much nitrogen is in a gas phase in the air and how much is frozen on the surface. The more nitrogen ice that evaporates, the thicker the atmosphere becomes. If too much nitrogen freezes to the ground, the atmosphere could collapse altogether.</p>

A faint glimpse of Pluto’s dark hemisphere in newly released mission images reveals some new details about how those ices behave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105398">SwRI, JHUAPL, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When New Horizons was there, Pluto’s south pole looked darker than the north pole. That suggests there was not a lot of fresh nitrogen frost freezing out of the atmosphere there, even though it was nearing winter. “The previous summer ended decades ago, but Pluto cools off pretty slowly,” Spencer says. “Maybe it’s still so warm [that] the frost can’t condense there, and that keeps the atmosphere from collapsing.”</p>



<p>There was a bright spot in the middle of the image, which could be a fresh ice deposit. That’s also not surprising, Howett says. The ices may still be moving from the north pole to the south pole as Pluto moves deeper into its wintertime.</p>



<p>“We’ve thought this for a long time. It makes sense,” she says. “But it’s nice to see it happening.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why depth interviewing is essential to understanding individuals and institutions</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/why-depth-interviewing-is-essential-to-understanding-individuals-and-institutions/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/christina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>From scraping &#8220;big data&#8221; from the internet to the analyzing genomic information about individuals and social groups, today’s researchers have a dizzying array of new methods for studying the social world. One consequence of this explosion of options has been to obscure the value of tried-and-true ones. Depth interviewing is a case in point. Once assumed to be a core research tool, many of today’s researchers have cast a skeptical eye on it. While past debates centered around whether we could rely on insights drawn from a limited number of people, new concerns have arisen from those who advocate direct observation, whether in natural or experimental settings. These skeptics express doubt that social researchers can trust the information gleaned from self-reports, pointing especially to the ways that depth interviewing may elicit accounts that are internally inconsistent or that contradict what people actually do. Such doubters argue that since people are prone to express ideas, beliefs, or behaviors that contradict one another, their self-reports are neither credible nor useful.<br><br>These critiques reflect a fundamental misunderstanding about what depth interviews can accomplish and how, when designed and carried out well, they are uniquely suited to gathering crucial insights about the nature of human consciousness and the relationship between thought and action. One-on-one interviewing creates a setting in which the “unobservable” becomes visible. Life history interviews allow people to describe and reflect on how prior experiences have led them to their current circumstances and outlooks, including what key events propelled them to devise life strategies and make consequential life choices. Focusing on the present, depth interviews provide a safe space where people are invited to share their most private experiences, thoughts, and feelings. While it is not be possible to observe a wide range of intimate activities, from sexual encounters to all sorts of dyadic interactions, interviews allow participants to describe and reflect on such events. And whatever the topic, interviews allow people to explore the meanings they attach to their actions and beliefs and to reveal the processes by which their social contexts created experiences that prompted ensuing responses.<br><br>Indeed, a key contribution of depth interviewing lies in its ability to uncover the contradictions that people express. Rather than accepting such accounts at face value, our research (and that of many others) demonstrates that we ignore contradictory thoughts and actions at our peril. Contradictory accounts as well as inconsistencies between “saying” and “doing” are central to human thought and action. Depth interviews provide an opportunity to delve into the nature of such beliefs and behaviors and explore the reasons people hold inconsistent views or act in apparently inconsistent ways. In addition to unearthing the meanings people imbue to their contradictory thinking or behavior, interviews can also discover the social contexts that give rise to them. When people express inconsistent beliefs or reveal conflicts between their values and choices, they alert us to look for the social contexts and cultural formations that create conflicts for which there are no simple or straightforward ways to respond. </p><p>Given the complexity of twenty-first-century life, it has become even more crucial to understand how people navigate the tensions created by conflicting institutional arrangements. In the context of a rapidly changing world, interviews shed light on the interplay between incompatible options and the evolving responses people craft to cope with them. Paying close attention to the different layers of meaning within each interview and carefully analyzing the patterns that emerge across all the interviewees enables depth interviewers to understand how social structures and cultural schemas shape human endeavors and how, in turn, social actors participate in constructing and potentially changing the world they inherit. By eliciting contradictory accounts and using them to delve into why people hold inconsistent beliefs or act in contradictory ways, depth interviews illuminate complex social patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>Whether the goal is to chart how structure and action interact as individuals build their life paths, to learn about intimate experiences that cannot be observed, to uncover how people give meaning to their own and others’ practices and beliefs, or to understand how social arrangements prompt people to hold contradictory views and take inconsistent actions, depth interviews are the best, and possibly the only, method for learning about such core social dynamics. When interviewers ask probing questions, listen carefully to their participants’ answers, and analyze their findings with an eye firmly focused on discovering the patterns that emerge from the complex material they gather, interviewing enlightens us about the many dimensions of human experience that cannot be reduced to numbers, biological factors, or observable behavior. As we rightfully seek to expand the social science toolkit, it would be ironic if we lose sight of a method that offers unique access to the hidden dimensions of personal and social life. Instead, we must renew our commitment to a research technique that places human consciousness at the forefront.</p><p><em><sup>Featured image by </sup></em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/eF7HN40WbAQ"><sup><em>Christina@wocintechchat.com</em></sup></a><em><sup> via Unsplash</sup></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/672104152/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f11%2fchristina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/i-wouldnt-start-from-here-a-shape-route-to-open-access/">&#8220;I wouldn&#x2019;t start from here&#8221;: a SHAPE route to open access</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/what-policy-and-industry-changes-are-needed-to-avert-climate-catastrophe/">What policy and industry changes are needed to avert climate catastrophe?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/sustainability-in-action-dismantling-systems-to-combat-climate-change/">Sustainability in action: dismantling systems to combat climate change</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Brain
Network Dynamics during Working Memory Are Modulated by Dopamine and Diminished
in Schizophrenia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible
working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood.
Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide
switching between activity states using a combination of functional
magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with
schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network
control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1
receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2
receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with
schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a
more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics
during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia
pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">A rush to watch a supernova exposed its last gasp before exploding</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mad scramble to observe the moments after a star’s death is helping scientists understand how the star lived out its last year.</p>



<p>Astronomers reported the exploding star just 18 hours after it flared up on March 31, 2020, in a galaxy about 60 million light-years away from Earth in the Virgo cluster. The supernova occurred in part of the sky already watched by NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/less-year-after-launch-tess-already-finding-bizarre-worlds">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>, which images large portions of the sky every 30 minutes (<em>SN: 1/8/19</em>). And a team of scientists quickly realized that data would track precisely how the eruption brightened over time, making it ideal for further study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn even more, the team leapt into action, viewing the supernova with a variety of telescopes in the hours and days that followed, even orchestrating a last-minute change of plans for the Hubble Space Telescope. That provided the supernova’s spectrum, an accounting of its light broken up by wavelength, at various moments after the blast.</p>



<p>All that data revealed that in the last year of its life, the star had <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab2887/6410679?redirectedFrom=fulltext">spewed some of its outer layers into space</a>, researchers report October 26 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The amount of material ejected was about 0.23 times the mass of the sun, the team estimates.&nbsp;When the supernova went off, it launched a shock wave that plowed through that material shortly after the explosion, generating light picked up by the telescopes.</p>



<p>As large stars get closer to death, they may start behaving erratically. Aging stars fuse heavier and heavier elements in their cores. For this star, the switch to fusing oxygen could have triggered that shedding in its last year, astrophysicist Samaporn Tinyanont of the University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues suggest. “These stars have a roller coaster last few years of their life,” Tinyanont says.</p>



<p>Scientists hope that understanding that roller coaster ride could help them recognize when other stars are about to blow.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Think about your relationships with your colleagues… I bet there are at least some who you’d call &#8220;frenemies&#8221;. Maybe there’s a co-worker whose sense of humour you love, say — but who also irritates you by failing to pull their weight. In fact, the workplace is the ideal breeding ground for relationships that are characterised by simultaneous, strong positive <em>and</em> negative feelings — so-called &#8220;ambivalent relationships&#8221; (or frenemies) — note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-88624-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s surprising, then, how little is known about how frenemies behave with each other, write Shimul Melwani at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Naomi Rothman at Lehigh University. So the pair ran a series of studies to find out.</p>



<span id="more-44293"></span>



<p>In the first, groups of 3 -6 students who’d been assigned a joint task were asked 2.5 weeks into the project to rate how positively and/or negatively they felt about each other. About a month later, they all reported on the extent to which they’d received help (support in a discussion, say), or harm (a verbal attack, perhaps), from each other. Unsurprisingly, the students gave more help to team members they liked and enacted more harmful behaviour towards those that they disliked. But the data also showed that frenemies both helped <em>and </em>harmed each other.</p>



<p>In a second study, the researchers used variations of a standard lab technique for developing closeness between two people. While seated in a cubicle by themselves, these participants used instant messaging to communicate with a partner, to share answers to a set of questions. Some followed questions designed to foster a positive relationship — by getting them to discuss their hobbies and interests, for example, and also to share a few things that they liked about their partner. Other pairs followed a &#8220;negative&#8221; question set (this included a final question that asked them to share a few things that they <em>didn’t </em>like about their partner). A third group followed a frenemy set. For example, after answering the question, &#8220;What is one recent accomplishment that you are proud of?&#8221; (a question that can enhance closeness and positive feelings between people), these participants had to compare and evaluate each other’s achievements (encouraging more negative feelings).</p>



<p>Next came what the participants believed was a collaborative task. And there were some interesting findings. Those in the ambivalent condition acted more co-operatively than those in the negative group; they claimed less of a shared reward, for example, and made more helpful contributions to a piece of work that they believed had been completed by their partner. However, they also delivered more harmful feedback about their partner to the experimenter, compared with those in the positive group — but delivered less negative feedback directly to their partner than did those in the negative group.</p>



<p>For their final study, the team turned to actual co-workers: they ran an online study of 166 US-based participants who worked in retail. These people reported on their experiences, emotions and motivations in actual positive, negative and ambivalent relationships with colleagues. For example, they reported on occasions in which they had supported these colleagues, or instigated arguments, acted rudely or started rumours about them.</p>



<p>Echoing the results of the second study, these employees were more likely to &#8220;covertly&#8221; harm frenemies (to spread rumours behind their back say) than people they felt positively about. But they also helped frenemies more than they helped people they didn’t like.</p>



<p>There are implications for workplaces, the researchers conclude. One important one is this: though ambivalent relationships involve high levels of negativity (as well as positivity), “they are much more beneficial compared to negative relationships,” they write. Managers could well struggle to turn negative relationships into positive ones. But if positivity-focused exercises, such as trust-building interactions, could shift relationships characterised by thorough dislike to frenemy status, everyone could benefit. “Even though it is impractical to entirely transform one’s worst relationships into one’s best ones, by infusing some positivity into these relationships, they can become ambivalent, and deliver some benefits at work,” the researchers write.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">Lithium-ion batteries made with recycled materials can outlast newer counterparts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lithium-ion batteries with recycled cathodes can outperform batteries with cathodes made from pristine materials, lasting for thousands of additional charging cycles, a study finds.&nbsp;<br><br>Growing demand for these batteries — which power devices from smartphones to electric vehicles — may outstrip <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the world’s supply of some crucial ingredients</a>, such as cobalt (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>). Ramping up recycling could help avert a potential shortage. But some manufacturers worry that impurities in recycled materials may cause battery performance to falter.</p>



<p>“Based on our study, recycled materials can perform as well as, or even better than, virgin materials,” says materials scientist Yan Wang of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.</p>



<p>Using shredded spent batteries, Wang and colleagues extracted the electrodes and dissolved the metals from those battery bits in an acidic solution. By tweaking the solution’s pH, the team removed impurities such as iron and copper and recovered over 90 percent of three key metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. The recovered metals formed the basis for the team’s cathode material.</p>



<p>In tests of how well batteries maintain their capacity to store energy after repeated use and recharging, batteries with recycled cathodes outperformed ones made with brand-new commercial materials of the same composition. It took 11,600 charging cycles for the batteries with recycled cathodes to lose 30 percent of their initial capacity. That’s <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00433-5">about 50 percent better than the respectable 7,600 cycles</a> for the batteries with new cathodes, the team reports October 15 in <em>Joule</em>. Those thousands of extra cycles could translate into years of better battery performance, Wang says.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>Today, software is a key part of almost all research, and the development and
maintenance of this software is done by human beings, often in academia. It&#8217;s
essential that these activities be seen as a valued element of scholarly work
so that the people who do it have career paths that encourage them to continue
to do it. One means of accomplishing this is to use the existing scholarly
citation&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group"><span class="caps">FORCE11</span> Software Citation working group</a> developed a
set of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles">Software Citation Principles in 2016</a>, and since then, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group"><span class="caps">FORCE11</span> Software Citation Implementation working group</a>
has been working with many types of stakeholders, including publishers,
repositories, and standards, to implement the principles.  We&#8217;ll talk about
this work, the changes we&#8217;ve seen, what still needs to be done, and how the
<span class="caps">INCF</span> community can&nbsp;participate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-alive-coronavirus-definition">Are viruses alive, not alive or something in between? And why does it matter?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Villain. Killer. Menace. </em>Since 2020, scientists and public officials have used these words to describe SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. News articles, research papers and tweets repeatedly personify the virus as a bad guy intent on killing us.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, we’re intent on killing it, with handwashing, antiseptic wipes, hand sanitizer, bleach, even robots zapping hospital rooms with ultraviolet light. Yet, according to most scientists, we’ve been working hard to kill something that isn’t alive.</p>

<p>Scientists have argued for hundreds of years over how to classify viruses, says <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2705">Luis Villarreal</a>, professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine, where he founded the Center for Virus Research. In the 1700s, viruses were believed to be poisons. In the 1800s, they were called biological particles. By the early 1900s, they’d been demoted to inert chemicals.</p>



<p>Throughout, viruses have rarely been considered alive. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/073911011010524992">More than 120 definitions</a> of life exist today, and most require metabolism, a set of chemical reactions that produce energy. Viruses do not metabolize. They also don’t fit some other common criteria. They do not have cells. They cannot reproduce independently. Viruses are inert packages of DNA or RNA that cannot replicate without a host cell. A coronavirus, for example, is a nanoscale sphere made up of genes wrapped in a fatty coat and bedecked in spike proteins.</p>



<p>Still, viruses have many traits of living things. They are made of the same building blocks. They replicate and evolve. Once inside a cell, viruses engineer their environment to suit their needs — constructing organelles and dictating which genes and proteins the cell makes. Recently discovered giant viruses — which rival the size of some bacteria — have been found to contain genes for proteins used in metabolism, raising the possibility that some viruses might metabolize.</p>





<p>Plus, almost every rule that excludes viruses from the land of the living has its own exceptions. For example, <em>Rickettsia</em> bacteria are classified as living but, like viruses, can multiply only within other cells. All living things, in fact, rely on other living things. A single rabbit cannot replicate on its own, but a rabbit is definitely alive, right?</p>



<p>For these reasons and others, the debate over whether viruses are alive or not continues today. In 2004, virologists Marc H.V. Van Regenmortel of the University of Strasbourg in France and Brian Mahy, then at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, defined viruses as “nonliving infectious entities that can be said, at best, to lead a kind of borrowed life.”</p>



<p>Or maybe a virus can be both nonliving <em>and</em> alive. In 2011, biologist Patrick Forterre of the Pasteur Institute in Paris argued that viruses alternate between an inactive state (outside a cell) and a living, metabolically active state (inside a cell) that he calls the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631074810001724?via%3Dihub">virocell</a>.</p>



<p>For Forterre, viruses are like seeds or spores. They have the potential for action and that potential can be extinguished. That, at least, jibes with our experience of investing endless time and money trying to kill HIV, Zika, SARS-CoV-2 and many more.</p>

Reported in 2018, the virus has a genetic instruction book that is bigger than that of some bacteria.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105301">J. Abrahão <em>et al/Nature Communications</em> 2018</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While debates over classification can at times feel frivolous, in reality how we talk about viruses affects how they are researched, treated and eradicated.</p>



<p>Personifying viruses as villains and menaces interferes with a real understanding of evolution and nature, says <a href="https://apc.ucc.ie/colin_hill/">Colin Hill</a>, an infectious disease specialist at University College Cork in Ireland. The most successful viruses are persistent and benign; they remain dormant in cells or reproduce slowly, so as to not damage a cell’s replication machinery. “Viruses and their prey are not fighting, they’re dancing,” says Hill. Yet that’s rarely how we perceive them.</p>



<p>What’s more, since viruses are frequently classified as nonliving, many types of viral infection — especially when viruses successfully colonize a host in a persistent, lifelong manner without causing acute illness — are ignored as “backwater” science, says Villarreal. “Think of it like having dirt on your shoe,” he says. Like that dirt, some scientists consider persistent viral infections as simply a nuisance and therefore not urgent to study. For example, a DNA virus called polyomavirus is commonly used in laboratories to study how viruses cause cancer. Yet because the virus’s rhesus macaque hosts seldom, if ever, get tumors from it, little is known about how and why polyomavirus persists in an animal population.</p>



<p>But understanding such infections is hugely important to humankind. “A persistent virus in one host is frequently quite nasty in another host, and that’s what we’re experiencing with COVID,” says Villarreal.</p>



<p>Viruses have been disregarded in other ways, too. Consider the tree of life, a model and research tool used to depict evolution through time. Viruses are routinely left off, including in popular versions such as the <a href="https://itol.embl.de/">Interactive Tree of Life</a>. Without viruses, one cannot fully understand the mechanisms of evolution, says Hill.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Viruses and their prey are not fighting, they’re dancing.”</p><cite>Infectious disease specialist Colin Hill</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Viruses are <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/factors-allow-viruses-infect-humans-coronavirus">wildly abundant</a>. They infect all cellular life, from single-celled bacteria to elephants, and they are especially dense in the ocean, where they work as a gigantic recycling network, ripping apart 20 percent of the bacteria and other microbes there each day to release tons of carbon, which is then used by other microorganisms to grow.</p>



<p>Across the globe, viruses don’t just infect cells, they leave behind genetic material. Viral DNA is transmitted not only from one viral particle to its progeny, but also to other viruses and other species. Because of this, viral genetic sequences have permanently taken up residence in the genomes of all organisms, including ours, and we rely on them. Viral DNA is required for the formation of the mammalian placenta; it is crucial in the growth of early embryos; and the human innate immune system is made up, in part, of ancient viral proteins. When a person is fighting COVID-19, they are doing it with the help of viruses that colonized our cells long ago.</p>



<p>In fact, some scientists consider viruses to be the world’s leading source of genetic innovation. Viruses are not a missing branch of the tree of life; they are woven into every limb and leaf.</p>



<p>Scientists may always dispute whether viruses are alive or not, but they can hopefully agree on the importance of viruses to life as we know it. “However you want to think about life,” says Villarreal, “viruses are going to be there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gecko-tail-regrow-regeneration-gene-editing-stem-cells">Gene-edited stem cells help geckos regrow more perfect tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>Regenerating body parts is never easy. For instance, some lizards can grow back their tails, but these new appendages are pale imitations of the original. Now, genetically modified stem cells are helping geckos grow back better tails. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tweaking and implanting embryonic stem cells on the tail stumps of mourning geckos (<em>Lepidodactylus lugubris</em>) allowed the reptiles to grow <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26321-9">tails that are more like the original than ever before</a>, researchers report October 14 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These findings are a stepping-stone to developing regenerative therapies in humans that may one day treat hard-to-heal wounds.</p>



<p>A gecko’s tail&nbsp;is an extension of its spine — with the vertebrae to prove it. Regenerated tails, however, are simpler affairs. “It’s just a bunch of concentric tubes of fat, muscle and skin,” says Thomas Lozito, a biologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>That’s because stem cells in adult geckos produce a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-salamanders-can-regrow-tails-lizards-cant">molecular signal that encourages the formation of cartilage in new tails</a>, but not bone or nervous tissues (<em>SN: 8/17/18</em>). Lozito and his colleagues used embryonic stem cells, which can develop into a wider range of tissues than adult stem cells, modified them to ignore this signal and then implanted them on the tail stumps of geckos that had their tails surgically removed. The tails that grew from these modified stem cells had bonelike grooves in the cartilage and generated new neural tissue at the top of the tail.</p>



<p>These modified tails still lack a spinal cord, making them a far cry from the original. “We fixed one problem, but there are still many imperfections,” Lozito says. “We’re still on the hunt for the perfect tail.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conversations about race can be seriously beneficial to children. Research has highlighted multiple positive <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12622">outcomes</a> for young people of all backgrounds — enhanced ability to accept different viewpoints and perspectives, increased levels of empathy, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-017-0766-5">better understanding of their own identity</a>, and less racial bias to name but a few. Yet some parents are still unwilling to take the time to have such conversations.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/38/e2106366118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, finds that readiness to have such conversations has a lot to do with the racial identity of parents themselves. Looking at family conversations in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Stanford University team finds that even in the context of the global conversation that followed the racially charged killing, White parents were far less willing to have conversations about race than their Black peers.</p>



<span id="more-44287"></span>



<p>Participants, who were either Black or White parents of children aged 0-18 living in the United States, were initially recruited in April 2020, six weeks before Floyd’s murder. First, participants indicated whether or not they have conversations with their children about race, racial inequality and racial identity, as well as how often those conversations were instigated. They were also asked to share a recent conversation they had had with their child, and rated how worried they were that their child might be a target of racial bias or might be racially biased towards others. Another set of parents also completed these measures two months later, in June 2020.</p>



<p>The results showed that, overall, a higher proportion of Black parents discussed race, racial inequality and racial identity than White parents. After the murder of George Floyd Black parents became more likely to discuss inequality, but White parents did not. There were also striking differences when it came to conversations about identity: Black parents remained just as likely to discuss being Black with their children after the murder of Floyd — but White parents were actually <em>less</em> likely to discuss being White. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among just those parents who discussed these topics, Black parents increased the frequency they spoke about them with their children after the murder, while White parents maintained the same frequency as before.</p>



<p>The next focus of analysis was the content of parents’ conversations, shared through open-ended answers. White parents were more likely to give their children colour-blind messages — one White parent, for example, reported telling their child that “the colour of your skin doesn’t matter”. But Black parents had far more realistic conversations with their children, preparing them to experience racial bias, police targeting, and injustice. Interestingly, White parents were also more likely to share colour-blind sentiments after Floyd’s murder.</p>



<p>Black parents were also more worried that their children would not only be <em>targets</em> of racial bias but actually biased themselves — but White parents had a low level of worry on both counts, and this remained low even after Floyd&#8217;s murder, perhaps suggesting a further resistance to engaging with questions of race.</p>



<p>So, overall, Black parents were both more willing to engage in questions of race than White parents and more willing to explore issues of injustice after a particularly traumatic event. White parents were also more likely to engage in conversations about race not mattering: colour-blindness, while potentially well-meaning, is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418766068">ultimately unproductive</a> as it reduces people’s willingness and ability to identify and engage with racial inequality. In the US, where the study took place, race certainly does matter.</p>



<p>The authors of the study note that part of White parents’ reluctance to talk about race could be down to simply not knowing how to address the subject, and suggest that work could be done on the effectiveness of different strategies. Future research could also look at <em>why</em> White parents are so unwilling to have such conversations. Do they feel uncomfortable and out of their depth? Do they (wrongly) think children are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/22/adults-put-off-crucial-conversations-about-race-because-they-mistakenly-think-young-children-wont-understand/">too young to understand</a>? Or is it that they simply don’t care? As the team puts it: “given the reality and brutality of racism and racial inequality, the time to answer these questions, and to have these conversations, is now.”</p>

A special instance of reverse inter-metamorphosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_lycanthropy" target="_blank">clinical lycanthropy</a>, the delusion that one has been transformed into a wolf (or another animal). A recent review identified 43 cases in the literature between 1852 and today (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.718101/full" target="_blank">Guessoum et al., 2021</a>).

The wolf has different characteristics and symbolic meanings across various cultures. As in other realms, popular media and folklore shape the content of the delusion. Occasionally, there may be a literal event that triggers the belief of transmogrification. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Clinical Kynanthropy After a Dog Bite</b><br /></p><p>This case report of kynanthropy <span><span>—</span></span> delusional transformation into a dog <span><span>—</span></span> was notable because the COVID-19 lockdown might have exacerbated the condition.  The patient was a 28-year-old single male who started grinning, barking, and walking on four legs after being bitten by a dog... but not until two years later (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02537176211047132" target="_blank">Jain et al., 2021</a>). <br /></p><p></p><blockquote>He was apparently alright until two months before the presentation, when, due to the COVID-19-related nationwide lockdown, he read excessively on the internet about dog bites. ... he developed a feeling that his tongue is moving like a dog’s and began having repetitive thoughts about converting into a dog. Gradually, his sleep reduced to 1–2 hours/day, and he expressed fear that if he sleeps, he might get up as a dog. He sought repeated reassurance from his family that he hasn’t transformed into a dog, to the extent that they got irritated and asked him to see a doctor. These repetitive thoughts would be present for the whole day, and he would chant God's name to get relief from them. </blockquote><p></p><p><br /><span></span></p><p>The man had no history of rabies, mood disorder, or substance use. Upon examination, he was anxious but did not present with depression or psychotic features. Instead, he had repetitive doubts about turning into a dog. The patient was diagnosed with moderate OCD (with poor insight) and given a prescription of 20 mg fluoxetine (Prozac). A month later, he reported improvement in his repetitive thoughts, and at three months showed an improvement in social and occupational function. He realized he had spent way too much time on the internet reading and watching videos about dog bites.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; <br /><span></span></p><p></p><p><b>Botanical Inter-metamorphosis</b> <br /></p>A unique arboreal delusion was briefly described in a recent abstract (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/xylological-variant-of-reverse-fregoli-syndrome-delusions-of-being-a-tree/89B04E3D281484E02E9FBC7FB8FE6580" target="_blank">Bakhshi &amp; Hirsch, 2021</a>): a depressed young woman believed she had been transformed into a tree. The major manifestations were standing still for long periods of time and repeating, "I am a tree." <br /><p></p><blockquote>A 21-year-old right-handed cisgender female, two months prior to presentation, noted stiffness and difficulty with ambulation. One-month prior to admission, she experienced recurrent depression with myriad vegetative and nonvegetative symptoms of depression. On admission her chief complaint was "I am a tree", standing motionless and minimally responding to query. After treatment with quetiapine, mirtazapine and hydroxyzine for a one-week period, her perception of being a tree fully resolved.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The authors considered a range of delusional diagnoses for her condition:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><u>Cotard’s syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> think she was dead <br /></li><li><u>Ekbom syndrome</u> (delusional parasitosis) – NO, she did <i>not</i> think her body was infested with bugs</li><li><u>Reverse Inanimate Capgras Syndrome</u> – MAYBE? (but "instead of an imposter replacing a close friend, who then is inserted into the sufferer; a tree has replaced the sufferer.")</li><li><u>Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, misindentification of another, <i>not</i> self</li><li><u>Botanical Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, another person transformed into a plant, <i>not </i>self <br /></li><li><u>Reverse Intermetamorphosis</u> – MAYBE? ("However, in this situation, the objects are all human or animate animals not botanicals.")  – <i>but isn't this the point, to report on a botanical?</i> <br /></li><li><u>Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, altered physical identity of another, <i>not </i>self<br /></li><li><u>Reverse Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, patient assumes the physical identity of another person, <i>not</i> a plant </li><li><u>Botanical Variant of Interparietal Syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> have parietal lobe damage. ("In this condition, parts of the body are perceived to be lifeless, due to lesions of the inferior parietal lobe...")</li></ul><p><br />The groundbreaking conclusion was that doctors should check for delusions involving plant life in all of these syndromes, because botanical variants have not been described before.</p><p>&nbsp;<br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/werewolves-of-london-ontario.html">Werewolves of London, Ontario</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/10/haunting-delusions-of-identity.html">Haunting Delusions of Identity</a><br /><br />  <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/ophidianthropy-delusion-of-being.html">Ophidianthropy: The Delusion of Being Transformed into a Snake</a> <br /><br /> <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/psychopharmacology-of-lycanthropy.html">Psychopharmacology of Lycanthropy</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/10/oldest-remaining-werewolf-movie.html">The oldest remaining werewolf movie&nbsp;</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/s268/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="160" data-original-width="268" height="191" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h191/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" width="320" /></a></div><p></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: arial;">Keanu Reeves as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/comments/9ff679/probably_keanus_least_known_but_imo_funniest_role/" target="_blank">Ortiz the Dog Boy</a> in <i>Freaked</i></span></b></div><p><br /><br /><b>References</b> <br /><br />Bakhshi HS, Hirsch AR.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/looking-back-on-science-can-refocus-our-attention">Looking back on science can refocus our attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Back in late 2019, the staff at <em>Science News</em> began planning how to celebrate our 100th birthday. We could tell the story of our founding, invite longtime readers to share their memories and, of course, look back at all that has changed in science. At the time, we had no idea that pandemics would bookend the magazine’s first century.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> launched its first news bulletins in April 1921, not long after the 1918 pandemic ended. That historical context wasn’t on our radar until the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Suddenly, reviewing a century of advances in infectious diseases became essential to our centennial coverage. As biomedical writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/aimee-cunningham">Aimee Cunningham</a> dove into the story — the many, many stories of lives upended by epidemics past and present — she realized that what hasn’t changed is perhaps more poignant than what has. </p>



<p>In the latest story from our Century of Science project, Cunningham recounts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/epidemics-infectious-disease-polio-flu-vaccine-aftermath-race">how new vaccines have saved lives and freed people from fears of devastating infections</a>. The research accomplishments since 1918 are clear. But other aspects of the story echo across the ages — the suffering, the isolation and the social inequities, notably the disproportionate effects on Black, Latino and Native American communities in the United States. Cunningham’s powerful reporting draws our attention to problems — scientific and societal — that still need solving.</p>



<p>There’s an unexpected parallel in a lighter story in this issue, about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-vision-eyes-color-senses-hearing-mating-courtship">jumping spiders</a>. These charismatic beasts have a pair of principal eyes that sharply focus on the world, plus smaller scanning eyes that alert those bigger eyes to what’s worth noticing. The spiders’ visual world is not entirely unlike our own. “Like the spider,” Betsy Mason writes, “we focus our attention on a relatively small area and largely ignore the rest until something catches our attention.” COVID-19 has been a red alert that infectious foes are still out there, and that health disparities persist. What else are we ignoring?</p>

<h4>Fuse and fizzle</h4>



<p><em>Laser-sparked nuclear fusion reactions released nearly as much energy as was used to ignite them, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">Physicists near a nuclear fusion feat</a>” (</em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 11<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Christopher</strong> asked how scientists contained the fusion reaction.</p>



<p>Fusion reactions don’t need to be contained because they fizzle out on their own, <strong>Conover</strong> says. Shortly after the laser blast ends, so do the reactions. This is one of the benefits of fusion, she says. Since the reactions stop on their own, unlike the fission reactions currently used to generate nuclear energy, there’s no risk of a runaway reaction leading to a meltdown.</p>





<h4>What makes a good life?</h4>



<p><em>Happiness and meaning are long-posited avenues to the “good life.” Psychological richness spurred by perspective-changing experiences may be a third path, <strong>Sujata Gupta </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">Roads to the good life</a>” (</em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 24<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Ellen Leff </strong>wondered whether people’s approaches to the good life change with age.</p>



<p>Paths to the good life may evolve over time,<strong> Gupta</strong> says. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z">Younger people tend to desire a life of happiness</a>, while older people lean toward psychological richness, a 2020 study published in <em>Affective Science</em> suggests. But that difference was found primarily in people in the United States. More research is needed to determine if the trend holds for people in other countries. Personality traits tend to be stable across time, <strong>Gupta</strong> says. People open to novel experiences, the trait most strongly linked with richness, will probably continue pursuing such experiences as they age. Theoretically, those people may report higher richness at the end of life than people who are less open to novel experiences.</p>



<h4>A weigh with words</h4>



<p><em>Flickers in a black hole’s accretion disk can help scientists measure its mass, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk">How black holes eat hints at their mass</a>” (</em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story inspired reader <strong>David Morse</strong>, a published author, to craft a poem:</p>



<p>Black holes feed on everything: kitchen scraps; whole galaxies. / Scientists are trying to weigh those vast star-suckers by what / they leave behind: a white-hot disc of gas and cosmic dust / that twinkles like a campfire in the night, but a billion times / brighter than our sun. Astronomers count that pulse, use Einstein’s / theory of relativity to calculate the weight. I can’t do the math, / only know this from afar, that scientists somewhere are counting / light to weigh the unweighable by its blinking residue. I can’t help / but see Albert himself peering past that droopy white moustache / like a green grocer testing a balance scale with his thumb, in / a world where nothing so personal exists, where green grocers / are all sucked into those big box stores, our sun a dying star.</p>



<h4>Pondering perspectives</h4>



<p><strong>Sujata Gupta’s</strong> story on psychological richness (see “What makes a good life?” above caught the attention of <em>Science News</em> reader <strong>Margaret Atwood</strong>. The acclaimed poet, essayist and novelist shared <strong>Gupta’s</strong> story with her millions of followers on Twitter, writing: “Perspective-changing experiences, good or bad, can lead to richer lives.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-kids-5-11-pfizer-parents-questions">What parents need to know about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11</a></h4>

              
                <p>Five to 11-year-olds are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommended Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine for use in children ages 5 to 11 on November 2. The vote was unanimously in favor of offering the vaccine to this group, after committee members agreed that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. CDC director Rochelle Walensky gave the final OK hours later.</p>



<p>“We know millions of parents are eager to get their children vaccinated and with this decision, we now have recommended that about 28 million children receive a COVID-19 vaccine,” Walensky said in a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102-PediatricCOVID-19Vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> announcing the decision. “As a mom, I encourage parents with questions to talk to their pediatrician, school nurse or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before ACIP’s vote, committee member and pediatrician Sarah Long of Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia said she “couldn’t be more supportive” of recommending the use of the vaccine for 5- to 11-year olds. “We have one more vaccine that saves the lives of children,” she said.</p>





<p>Representatives for pediatric medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, also spoke before the vote in support of giving this age group access to the COVID-19 vaccine. “I have seen the devastating effects of COVID-19 infection,” said Pamela Rockwell, who practices family medicine in Ann Arbor, Mich., on behalf of the latter group. The vaccine will offer protection from the “very real and significant harms of COVID-19.”</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration officially issued an emergency use authorization for the vaccine on October 29. That authorization had passed its first hurdle October 26 when an FDA advisory panel gave a thumbs-up to make the vaccine available to 5- to 11-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to endorse emergency use authorization of the vaccine followed an extensive discussion among experts on the FDA panel. Many panelists, for instance, expressed concerns about myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis has been an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis">uncommon, but potentially serious, side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines</a>, primarily in male adolescents and young adults <em>(SN: 6/23/21</em>). Other experts emphasized that while children are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than adults, kids aren’t spared from the worst of the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer for vaccine policy at the CDC, the answer is clear. “We don’t want children to be dying of COVID, even if it is far fewer children than adults,” she said. “And we don’t want them in the ICU.”</p>



<p>FDA Advisory Committee member and pediatrician Jay Portnoy said at the meeting that Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., where he works, has been full for the last month or so, and many of the admitted kids have COVID-19. “I’m looking forward to being able to actually do something to prevent that,” he said.</p>

<p>And for children who have spent much of the last two years facing disrupted school and social lives, vaccination is a step toward normalcy. “It’s really to allow kids the freedom to be kids and do all the things comfortably that kids do,” Emmanuel Walter Jr., a pediatrician at Duke University School of Medicine and chief medical officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute said in an October 27 news briefing. Once vaccinated, children can go to school, play sports and “do the normal things kids want to do.”</p>



<p>Vaccinations are key to preventing disease, in adults and kids. Here’s what to know about kids, COVID-19 and the Pfizer vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How has COVID-19 affected 5- to 11-year-olds?</h4>



<p>As of October 28, 171 children <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">in this age group in the United States have died of COVID-19</a>, according to CDC’s COVID data tracker. Looking at the top 10 causes of death for children in 2019, COVID-19 would be eighth on that list, said Fiona Havers, a medical officer with the CDC’s COVID-19 Public Health Response during a presentation at the FDA meeting. More than 8,300 kids ages 5 to 11 have been hospitalized so far, and about a third of those needed intensive care, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inequities that have been seen throughout the pandemic have not spared younger children. Among 5- to 11-year-olds, the hospitalization rate is three times as high for Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native children as it is for white children, Havers said. Advisory committee member and immunologist James Hildreth, who is president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said the primary reason for his yes vote was to make sure that “the children who really need this vaccine, primarily the Black and brown children in this country, get the vaccine.”</p>



<p>The overall rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 for 5- to 11-year-olds roughly matches what was seen for influenza seasons before the pandemic. But that’s with masking, school closures and other public health measures. Without those precautions, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate may be higher than that seen in past flu seasons, Havers said.</p>



<p>More than 5,000 children who were infected with the coronavirus have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which causes severe inflammation throughout the body. Of those reported cases, 39 percent were among children ages 6 to 11, Havers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.15870">can also experience long COVID</a>, in which symptoms such as fatigue, cough, headaches, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and pain in the muscles and joints persist after being sick. These continued symptoms can limit activity and impact mental health and school attendance. Long COVID can occur after mild or severe disease or following MIS-C. It’s still unclear how many children have been affected by long COVID. One estimate, from a survey by the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics, reported that 7 to 8 percent of U.K. children who had gotten COVID-19 still had symptoms more than 12 weeks after being diagnosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COVID-19 has severely disrupted children’s lives beyond its capacity to cause illness. Children have been kept out of school, which has stalled the education of many kids, and for many has meant missing out on regular meals. School closures that happened during just a few months, from August to October of 2021, as the delta variant was surging, affected more than 1 million students in the United States. We don’t yet know the extent of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">educational and emotional toll</a> school closures have taken on children (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>).</p>





<h4>How was the vaccine evaluated?</h4>



<p>In a clinical trial, Pfizer assessed the immune response and the safety of their mRNA vaccine in kids 5 to 11. The trial included about 2,250 children, with two-thirds getting the shot and the other third receiving a placebo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An earlier study had determined that this age group had a good immune response to a smaller dose, two shots of 10 micrograms, compared with the 30-microgram-per-shot dose given to adolescents and adults. Children’s immune systems tend to respond well to vaccines, so to avoid unnecessarily strong symptoms after a shot, such as high fevers or excessive achiness, the goal with the smaller dose is to hit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer">the right sweet spot between a protective immune response and side effects</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/21</em>).</p>



<h4>How well does the vaccine work?</h4>



<p>The data suggest the vaccine works very well for this age group.</p>



<p>Pfizer assessed kids’ immune response to the vaccine by looking at antibody levels. The company compared the response in a group of 5- to 11-year-olds one month after the second shot with antibody levels seen in a group of 16- to 25-year-olds, who were part of the earlier and much larger <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean">clinical trial that studied the vaccine’s efficacy</a> in tens of thousands of adults (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). There was no difference in the immune responses between the different groups, even though the younger children received a smaller dose, the FDA reported in their review of Pfizer’s trial data. Since the immune response was similar between the two groups, the protection against COVID-19 offered by the vaccine for each group should also be similar.</p>



<p>Pfizer also looked at how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases occurred at least a week after the second shot in children who were vaccinated compared with those who received the placebo. Three of 1,450 vaccinated children developed the disease, while 16 of 736 unvaccinated did, which Pfizer reports as an efficacy of 90 percent. None of the children in the trial had severe COVID-19 or MIS-C.</p>

<h4>What are the side effects?</h4>



<p>In the clinical trial, common side effects were redness, swelling and pain at the site of the injection in the arm, as well as headache and fatigue. There were no cases of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-severe-allergic-reactions-extremely-rare-cdc">anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction</a> that was reported, though rarely, when the Pfizer vaccine was first given to adults outside clinical trials (<em>SN: 1/6/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What about heart inflammation called myocarditis?</h4>



<p>No cases of myocarditis occurred in kids ages 5 to 11 in the follow-up period, three months after vaccination. But with the possibility that this rare complication could occur once the vaccine is used in larger numbers, weighing the risk of myocarditis against the benefits of being protected against COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death took up much of the discussion at the FDA’s advisory panel meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tens of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given to 12- to 29-year-olds. Of 877 confirmed myocarditis cases in this group and 829 hospitalized, there have been no deaths. As of October 6, 607 of 789 adolescents and young adults discharged from the hospital are known to have recovered from their symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Myocarditis can also occur with COVID-19. Patients <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm">with the disease had 16 times the risk for myocarditis</a> as patients without the disease, according to a study of U.S. hospital data from March 2020 to January 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA and CDC have several post-vaccine safety surveillance systems in place. “We will continue to actively look for adverse events,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Md., at the advisory meeting. The CDC and the FDA “are incredibly committed and devoted” to catching any safety issues as soon as possible, he said.</p>



<p>When myocarditis occurs in the general population, due to infection or other causes, it tends to happen after puberty. Based on the lower typical rate for younger kids and the lower vaccine dose that this group will receive, “I am not as concerned about myocarditis,” said Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta. Authorizing the vaccine “is a good move forward for COVID prevention and for protecting our kids.”</p>



<h4>How can parents be sure children are getting the correct, smaller dose?</h4>



<p>The vials of Pfizer vaccine intended for those 12 and older have a purple cap and purple lettering on the label.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help make sure that 5- to 11-year-olds get the right vial, the company has changed the color scheme to orange.</p>



<h4>Should 11-year-olds wait until their 12th birthday to get the same dose that adults do?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>“I would not wait,” said Walter, the Duke pediatrician, who was involved in the clinical trial for Pfizer’s vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because even with the lower dose of the vaccine, 11-year-olds developed lots of antibodies. Data presented during the October 26 FDA advisory meeting show that 5- to 11-year-olds had similar antibody levels as older age groups a month after the second dose. “I’m confident they’ll have the same protection” as 12-year-olds, Walter said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How can parents prepare kids to get the vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The shots can have typical side effects like fever or fatigue. So it may be worth telling children that they might feel achy, have a headache or just not feel good overall for the next day or so, Walter said. “That’s to be expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those symptoms are usually pretty mild. But some kids may end up with stronger side effects, such as feeling more fatigued, than others. If your child does end up feeling crummy, Walter said, it’s OK to use pain medication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/29/young-people-around-the-world-report-high-levels-of-climate-anxiety/">Young People Around The World Report High Levels Of Climate Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In the past few years, the effects of climate change have become undeniably apparent. In the last two years alone, headlines have been full of climate disasters — from forest fire smoke turning San Francisco&#8217;s sky luminous red, to torrential flooding in Germany and China.</p>



<p>In the face of events like this, anxiety and fear about climate change is undoubtedly increasing. Far from being indicative of mental illness, climate anxiety (also known as eco-anxiety or climate distress) more neatly fits under the banner of “practical anxiety”: fear that motivates change to help us respond to threats. Even though this in itself is useful, the experiences of fear can be unrelenting, and have serious consequences for mental health and functioning.</p>



<p>Young people are more at risk than those from older generations; an uncertain and dangerous climate situation poses the most risk to their futures, after all.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Caroline Hickman and colleagues at the University of Bath set out to investigate the extent of young people’s feelings and thoughts on climate change, and the functional impact associated with them. In their global study, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955">posted as a preprint at SSRN,</a> they look how the threats of climate change, as well as government response to these threats, affect the emotions and day to day functioning of young people.</p>



<span id="more-44282"></span>



<p>Ten thousand participants aged between 16 and 25 years old were recruited via an online survey portal. These participants were based in ten different countries from around the world, as far flung as Australia, Brazil, India, and Finland. All completed a measure of climate anxiety constructed specifically for this study by 11 experts in relevant areas of psychology and law. Participants were not made aware of the topic of the survey before starting.</p>



<p>The measure itself contained eight broad sections; these related to worry about climate change, its impact on their functioning, emotions and thoughts about climate change, as well as feelings of being ignored on the topic, beliefs about government response to the threat, and the emotional impact of that response. In order to more closely investigate particular constructs, such as negative feelings about climate change or negative thoughts about government response, the team also condensed scores from relevant items across these sections during their analyses. And, last but not least, emotional impacts of government responses were split into two scales — the reassurance scale, and the betrayal scale — to allow closer analysis of positive and negative feelings, respectively.</p>



<p>Across all countries, the majority of participants (60%) reported feeling “very” or “extremely” worried about climate change. More than 45% reported that these feelings negatively impacted their daily lives. By country, those expressing the highest amount of worry tended to be from poorer regions, in the Global South, and those who had been more directly impacted by climate change. For example Portugal, where there have in recent years been extensive wildfires, rated highest for worry amongst its neighbours in the Global North.</p>



<p>Participants reported a wide range of negative emotions: 77% said the future was frightening, and over 50% had felt afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty about climate change. Optimism and indifference, unfortunately, were not often reported. When talking to others about climate change, almost half of participants said their concerns had been ignored or dismissed.</p>



<p>When it came to rating government response, participants were generally unimpressed. Over 60% of respondents disagreed with every positive statement about their government’s climate action, though this did vary significantly between countries. Across all regions, however, feelings of betrayal were higher than those of reassurance.</p>



<p>Correlational analyses indicated close positive relationships between negative thoughts, worry about climate change, and impact on functioning. These factors also correlated strongly with feelings of government betrayal and negative beliefs about their response to the climate threats at hand, suggesting that those who believed the government to be underperforming in their response to climate change experienced more negative psychological consequences. In many, this is likely to constitute Moral Injury – significant psychological distress caused by witnessing a traumatic event that runs against the viewer’s morals, that they are powerless to stop. Not only can Moral Injury further increase mental health risks, the authors say, but it could also open the door to lawsuits based on psychological harm.</p>



<p>The measure used in this study was not standardised, as no suitable measure existed previously, meaning further investigation as to its validity would likely be beneficial. And of course, the data is correlational, meaning that no conclusions about causality can be drawn from this data (no matter how intuitive they may feel).</p>



<p>Even so, taken together, the data collected in study stands as firm evidence that climate anxiety is evident across the globe. This continued stress on the younger members of our populations severely affects their emotions and ability to function day-to-day. Given the timescale of issues at hand, it’s easy to imagine how the rapidly increasing threats of climate change could give rise to mental health issues among many young people, especially if governments continue to fail in their responses. Further research into these climate-specific stressors as precursors to mental health issues in young people will likely illuminate this relationship further.</p>



<p>The authors say that their results also demonstrate the point that climate anxiety isn’t simply caused by ecological catastrophe: it’s also directly related to government inaction. Greater levels of action and commitment by governments can not only enable us to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century, it also has the potential to improve the mental wellbeing of citizens around the world.</p>

                <p>For years, scientists have tried to crack a mathematical mystery: Is there an equation that can perfectly describe each and every bird egg? Variable shell shapes complicated things. But it turns out the answer is simple. A formula using just four easily measured dimensions can calculate the shape of any avian egg, be it round as a ping-pong ball, a smooshed sphere, oblong or a curvaceous pear, researchers report in an upcoming issue of the <em>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>It was that last shape that had eluded the eggs-perts. They found themselves yoked to an equation that couldn’t accurately describe pyriform, or conical, eggs. Previously, researchers developed an equation that accounted for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flight-demands-may-have-steered-evolution-bird-egg-shape">spherical brown hawk owl eggs</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>), elliptical <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eggs-evolved-color-and-speckles-only-once-during-dinosaur-age">emu eggs</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/18</em>), ovoid osprey eggs and other similarly shaped eggs. &nbsp;But that formula didn’t apply to the pear-shaped eggs from birds like great snipes and King penguins.</p>



<p>The new formula needs four inputs: the egg’s length, its maximum breadth, its diameter at the spot where its pointed end terminates and the location of its maximum diameter in relationship to the midpoint of its length. Adding one additional function and incorporating that last diameter variable to existing egg math led to the universal equation.</p>



<p>The finding could have real-life implications, says Darren Griffin, a geneticist at the University of Kent in England, who did the work along with Kent biologist Michael Romanov and Valeriy Narushin, an agricultural engineer formerly at Kent. For example, being able to calculate an egg’s shape could help designers create better padded or form-fitting egg containers, minimizing grocery store waste or that disappointing moment of arriving home with a carton of eggs, opening the lid and finding your eggs cracked. “We’re all supposed to check in the box” before leaving the store, but it’s easy to forget, says Griffin.</p>







<p>The equation could also come in handy in conservation efforts. When reintroducing a bird species, “one of the considerations would be ‘How likely are the eggs to break?’” Griffin says. Knowing an egg’s math could help researchers calculate what parts are most vulnerable to cracking, which in turn could help them assess where and how best to place them in certain habitats to help grow the population in those areas.</p>



<p>The formula’s simplicity “makes this approach practical for field studies” and could even enable researchers to collect the measurements from digital photographs, says Mark Hauber, an ornithologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “My lab had been working on something like this, but we weren’t able to derive the new math.” His recent <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201615">work</a> has focused on determining “how birds themselves can tell if an object is naturally egg-shaped or an artificial shape that shares some of the geometry with natural eggs.”</p>



<p>The discovery of the egg equation came while the researchers were exploring how to nondestructively assess the sexes of avian embryos before eggs are incubated. They were looking for physical differences between the attributes of eggs containing female and male embryos, Narushin says. The universal formula is an initial step in “resolving such an enigma.” Now they’re working on a new brood of egg problems, searching for a universal formula for computing the volume and surface area of various eggs, as well as exploring “mathematical shell secrets,” such as why shell thickness differs by species. &nbsp;</p>
