<p>"Specifically, the wikidata proposal for GLAM institutions involves: (1) advancing the implementation of the already tested model of residence of the Wikipedia specialists in the institutions; (2) connect the wikidata with locally controlled vocabularies; (3) use the Wikidata authorities to describe collections of traditional and indigenous knowledge in their collections; (4) join efforts in the wiki citation project, which has gathered considerable volume of bibliographic data; as well as the shared use of tools and standards that promote qualified access to institutions’ collections, such as Scholia (web browsing tool), Rights Statements, and IIIF images). Undoubtedly, a robust and interesting strategy."</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/18/how-weather-influences-the-brain/">How Weather Influences the Brain?</a></h4>

<p>We all know that the weather can strongly influence our mood and productivity. Many people feel better when the weather is nice and sunny. It is thus not surprising that people more often feel unhappy and depressed in winter. There is even a medical condition known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/">winter depression</a>. Still, some researchers believe that our brain functions better during the cold days. In this article, I’ll briefly analyze what happens in our brain in relation to weather-related mood and mind changes.</p>
<p>Scientific studies indicate that weather conditions such as high temperature and humidity can impair mental performance by affecting brain neurochemistry. For instance, it is believed that thermal stress can cause cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>One recent study has investigated the impact of thermal stress on cognitive functions in soldiers spending at least one year in desert conditions. The evaluation of memory and cognitive functions indicated there is a decline in cognitive performance in hot climates when compared to normal weather. The decline was most pronounced for attention, concentration, verbal memory, and psychomotor performance.</p>
<p>Another recent study has investigated the impact of sand and dust storms on children’s cognitive function. Using mathematical analysis and word-recognition test scores, how prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms affects the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/13/how-does-starting-school-early-impact-educational-attainment/">cognitive performance of children </a>was evaluated. The authors found a decline in both test scores, as well as a later beginning of counting and speaking in whole sentences in children prenatally exposed to storms. The findings imply that this kind of weather jeopardizes the cognitive functions of the next generation.</p>
<p>However, results from scientific research on the effects of temperature on cognitive functions are quite mixed and contradictory.</p>
<p>One study investigated <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">how temperature affects the cognitive performance of subjects with multiple sclerosis</a>. Healthy subjects were included as controls. The researchers correlated cognitive status with temperature in both study groups. In patients with multiple sclerosis, unlike in healthy subjects, the higher temperatures were associated with worsening cognitive status. These findings confirmed that warmer outdoor temperatures lead to a higher incidence of clinical exacerbation and T2 lesion activity in subjects with this condition (T2 lesions represent the white spots observed by MRI that are used to diagnose and track the progress of multiple sclerosis).</p>
<p>With regard to cognitive functions in cold weather, studies have shown both impairments and improvements.</p>
<p>For instance, one study investigated the impact of exposure to the cold and the following rewarming on working memory and executive functions in 10 young males. The results demonstrated a decline in the test results when the subjects were exposed to 10°C, and these impairments persisted for one hour during the rewarming period. Although the underlying mechanisms were not tested, the authors suggested that acute vascular changes in the brain could explain the observed changes. According to the authors, another explanation could be a deregulation of catecholamine levels, particularly important for complex attentional functions.</p>
<p>Other findings suggest that winter helps to wake up our mind and makes us think more clearly. It is well known that the brain utilizes glucose as its main energy source. Thus, when glucose is depleted, brain functioning is jeopardized. Energy, i.e., glucose, is also used for the regulation of body temperature, especially in extremely hot or cold conditions. It seems that more energy (glucose) is needed to cool down than to warm up the body. Thus, warm temperatures are more likely to deplete glucose levels and thus impair brain function and clarity of thinking.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that high temperatures increase the risk of mental disorders, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>One recent study has analyzed data on emergency admissions linked to mental diseases and daily temperatures over a period of more than 10 years in 6 different cities. The results indicated that high temperatures might jeopardize mental health and be responsible for the exacerbation of symptoms of mental diseases. For instance, according to the results, more than 30% of admissions for anxiety were attributed to hot temperatures. Exposure to hot temperatures leads to reactions in the body that may cause an increase in stress hormone levels and brain temperature. Additionally, extremely hot weather may deregulate the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">dopamine and serotonin levels</a> (these neuromediators are important for the feeling of happiness).</p>
<p>According to widespread belief, weather can affect our mood. Although a lack of sunshine is commonly linked to seasonal depression, some researchers believe that not all individuals respond similarly to weather changes.</p>
<p>Research has linked an individual’s self-reported daily mood with the objective weather over a 30 day period. Large individual differences have been found in how people react to the weather. Accordingly, four distinct types of weather responders have been identified: summer lovers (i.e., a better mood with warmer weather and more sun), summer haters (i.e., a worse mood with warmer weather and more sun), rain haters (i.e.,  a bad mood on rainy days), and unaffected (i.e., no particular association between weather and mood). Interestingly, adolescents and their mothers are often the same type, suggestive of familial weather reactivity.</p>
<p>The analysis of both scientific and popular literature permits the conclusion that extreme weather conditions can affect our cognitive function and mood. Most likely, this is caused by a decline in the brain’s energy source (glucose), which needs to be used for thermoregulation. Also, it is evident that extreme temperatures affect the level of catecholamines in the brain (such as dopamine and serotonin). Still, it seems that there is some individual variability in the brain’s response to weather, and it may run in the family.</p>

<p>"The ecosystem of scientific publishing that we all rely on isn’t working as it should. Publishers generate profit by locking away vital results behind steep paywalls, going after those who breach them with deadly force. Research professionals are pressured to deliver, publish and review on tight deadlines, creating perverse incentives to exaggerate facts and omit assumptions and constraints. With little to no reward for authors and reviewers, and with the peer-review process hidden behind closed doors, reproducibility is disastrously low.</p>

<p>A radical change is needed. Science can be better; we need science to better. But the only way to change this is if we – researchers and scientists, librarians, scientific societies, R&amp;D departments, universities, students, and innovators – all come together to bring about change.</p>

<p>[Google translate] NORADICALISM</p>

<p>NORADICALISM project wants to put young people in contact with the different groups and religious who interact with their daily life contexts; promoting the process of understanding the structural diversity of European society as a value and not as a barrier to peaceful coexistence. The project implements this approach in the main socializing institution, the school, by building a network based on sharing information, good practices and knowledge based on a research-action path. These elements function as a socially constructed antidote to the dynamics of exclusion and radicalisation among young people by providing teachers and schools with tools and practices regarding religious issues. The project aims to design and implement an integrated set of activities and "open educational resources" (OER) to promote interreligious dialogue at school in cooperation with stakeholders and religious communities in the partner countries.</p>

<p>The South Tyrolean research centre hosts the LTER national conference.</p>

<p>LTER stands for Longterm Ecological Research. Across Italy, at various terrestrial, freshwater and marine sites, researchers perform long-term measurements. The extensive data set includes environmental parameters such as air temperature, soil humidity, solar radiation and precipitation. With this information, researchers can accurately record ecological processes and predict the effects of climate change more accurately. One of these research sites is the open-air laboratory located in Val di Mazia, in the upper Val Venosta, coordinated by the researchers of Eurac Research together with colleagues from the universities of Bolzano and Innsbruck. [...] The principle of open science according to which data must be shared not only within the scientific network, but with a wider public is the common thread of this edition of the national conference.</p>

<p>[From Google Translation] For LERU, the League of European Research Universities, the possibilities opened up by Open Science can ensure greater transparency and a better response to the needs of interdisciplinary research and training, as well as greater efficiency and productivity in tackling innovative challenges.</p>

<p>With an official document, issued in conjunction with the decisions of the Council of the European Union on the European Open Science Cloud, LERU reaffirms the importance of Open Science for the academic and scientific world, defining it as a unique opportunity to transform the circulation of ideas within it and to open up to a different relationship with society.</p>

<p>For this transformation to become effective, however, there is a need for spaces for negotiation that will facilitate the transition towards a new way of sharing scientific studies. That is why in its document Leru addresses all the fundamental aspects of Open Science for each of the eight areas identified by the European Commission.</p>

<p>From the future of academic publications to FAIR data and the European Open Science Cloud, from research integrity to citizen science, LERU highlights the benefits and cost of future challenges and highlights the implications of an innovative approach to knowledge, which requires extensive productive interaction with external stakeholders.</p>

<p>Aware that the complexity of the transition processes towards Open Science is different for each specific institution, LERU provides universities with a series of guidelines on how to manage the transition to Open Science at an institutional level, as well as parameters to measure progress.</p>

<p>The document, which is in no way intended to be exhaustive, is proposed as a roadmap that allows each university to draw up its own strategy and plan times and ways to achieve its path towards Open Science.</p>

<p>[From Google translate] EU budget: Commission proposes 100 billion for research and innovation</p>

<p>Rome, June 7. (askanews) - For the period 2021-2027, the European Commission is proposing "the most ambitious research and innovation agenda ever", with a budget of €100 billion, €20 billion more than the previous Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The new programme, called "Horizon Europe" will consolidate the results and success of H2020 (which has so far supported 18,000 projects and awarded more than 31 billion euros) and will enable the EU to remain at the forefront of research and innovation worldwide. "Horizon 2020 is one of Europe's greatest successes. The new Horizon Europe programme - said Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation - has even more ambitious objectives. With this in mind, we intend to increase funding for the European Research Council to strengthen the EU's position as a world leader in science and regain public confidence by setting ambitious new EU research missions. We also intend to propose a new European Innovation Council to modernise the financing of breakthrough innovations in Europe.</p>

<p>What happens when industry and academia join forces for the sake of science? They launch an open access website that helps researchers discover new medical treatments.</p>

<p>Chemical probes are important tools in pharmaceutical research. Chemical biologists frequently use these small molecules to study or manipulate biological systems such as cells and organisms. Although the pharmaceutical industry has generated many high-quality probes, the related data are often missing or misleading. This lack of reliable data is an obstacle for researchers who decide what chemical tools to use in their research for new therapies. </p>

<p>To address this lack of accessible knowledge, a group of pharmaceutical companies, universities, hospitals and research organisations have joined forces to make a large number of innovative probes and associated data available to the research community. With partial EU funding through the ULTRA-DD project, the partners have launched a website called "Open Science Probes". The site provides information on a unique collection of probes with related data and control compounds, how to use the molecules and how to order them. The chemical tools and specific knowledge made available are described in an article published on the eLife platform. </p>

<p>From <i>You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling</i> to <i>Nothing Compares 2 U</i>, there’s no shortage of songs about heartbreak. None, I suspect, contains the line, “Now it’s time to give negative reappraisal a go.” But whether you’ve just been dumped or you’ve done the dumping, if you’re still in love with your ex, this could be your best strategy for falling out of love and moving on, according to a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2017-37800-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Romantic break-ups can have serious consequences including insomnia, reduced immune function, broken heart syndrome, depression and suicide,” note the authors, Sandra Langeslag and Michelle Sanchez at the University of Missouri, St Louis. Strategies that help people to fall out of love could relieve the agony of unrequited love or make it easier to get out of a dysfunctional relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34035"></span></p>
<p>Langeslag and Sanchez recruited 20 women and four men for their study. (As it was hard to get male volunteers, they decided to sacrifice gender balance in favour of having enough participants for the statistical analysis). All these people had experienced a romantic break-up, were still upset about it, and could supply 28 digital pictures of their ex. These pictures had to include a range of facial expressions, and show the ex-partner in different situations (all non-intimate), to mimic the kinds of real-world reminders the participants might endure – seeing their ex on the street, or on social media, for example.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the lab, the researchers showed the participants their full collection of pictures four times over. In between seeing each shot, they were prompted to engage in one of three potential strategies to down-regulate love, and then report on a sliding scale how “in love” and how generally positive or negative they felt. One strategy was “love reappraisal” (they were presented with statements such as “It’s okay to love someone I’m no longer with”, for example.) Another involved simple distractions (between photos, they were asked to think about their favourite food, for example). There was also a control, in which they were asked to think about nothing in particular. And finally, there was “negative reappraisal” which involved reminding themselves of the negative qualities of their ex partners (prompts included ‘What is an annoying habit of your ex?’ for instance).</p>
<p>While neither love reappraisal or distraction changed how in love the participants reported feeling, negative reappraisal of the ex did. Negative reappraisal also made the participants feel more negative in the moment – but such short-term discomfort may be worth enduring if this strategy helps people to get over a break-up, the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That is an “if”, however. As Langeslag and Sanchez concede, this study only looked at feelings of love immediately after each photo was presented. The practicalities of the strategy also remain unclear. If you know you’re going to bump into your ex at work, say, should you be focusing on their negative qualities during every commute in – or would an occasional bout of negative reappraisal have the same effect? And what exactly would using the negative reappraisal strategy mean in terms of how long it takes you to get over the relationship?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“To evaluate which regulation strategies would best help people cope with a break-up, it would be essential to consider both the short-term and long-term effects,” the researchers write. It will also be important to study more men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A traditional Amazonian psychedelic brew is an effective and rapid-acting antidepressant, according to a paper just published. But the new study revives some long-standing questions.



Ayahuasca is a mixture of herbs, traditionally used for spiritual and therapeutic purposes. The main active ingredients are N,N-DMT, a potent psychedelic, and several molecules that inhibit the enzyme MAO. The MAO inhibitors serve to prevent the N,N-DMT from being broken down by the digestive system, allowing

<h4>The project will focus on applying advanced imaging technologies paired with precise genetic techniques to disentangle how inhibitory circuits in the cortex are constructed.</h4>
<p>Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has been awarded a $2.4 million five-year grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Over the life of the grant the Taniguchi Lab will take a closer look at a class of brain cells known as inhibitory interneurons, studying how members of this diverse cell type assemble into specific circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>The cerebral cortex is arguably the brain’s most complex structure, endowing us with extraordinary abilities such as sensory perception, language, and cognition. Underlying these capabilities are the intricate connections made by the neurons that reside within, enabling complex encoding and processing of information. Interneurons in the cortex normally act to balance, refine and shape information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in a wide array of brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy.</p>
<p>Despite their critical importance, comprehensive wiring diagrams of interneuron circuits and the exact principles that guide their assembly have remained rather elusive. One challenging aspect hindering the design of a concrete cortical blueprint, is the sheer diversity of interneurons and principle neurons they form connections with. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make specific connections depending on a principle neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Until very recently, neuroscientists lacked readily available tools sensitive enough to study these connections at a cell-type specific resolution. Overcoming this obstacle, the Taniguchi lab has designed novel genetic tools and incorporated them into the established technique of retrograde monosynaptic labeling, producing unprecedented results.</p>
<p>Their powerful technique now allows for the precise tracing of connections from individual types of interneurons. MPFI scientists will be able to determine how inhibitory connections form during development and elucidate the organization of specific inhibitory inputs on varying types of principle neurons. Uncovering these principles will dramatically improve our understanding of cortical circuits as well as pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of prominent brain disorders.<br />
“Cortical interneurons are a unique cell class with rich diversity, containing numerous types with distinctive features and functional properties.” Notes Dr. Taniguchi, “This crucial funding will allow us to probe individual types of interneurons, better establishing the principles behind their wiring. Addressing this critical topic will lead to a better understanding of inhibitory circuit design and the future development of novel therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.”</p>

Transparency begins …. with a T, as Ali G once said. That seems to be extent of the University of Liverpool’s commitment to openness, at least in the handling of an ongoing misconduct investigation at the UK institution.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-1_Overall-winner_Podocnemis-expansa_Ana-Carolina-Lima​-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We are delighted to announce that the 6th annual <em>BMC Ecology</em> image competition launches today! We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.</p>
<p>We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science.</p>
<p>The three previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unraveling.</p>
<p>The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/aug/18/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2017-in-pictures">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/awardwinning-photos-taken-during-actual-scientific-research-this-year/">IFL</a> Science, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/">Scientific American</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151">the BBC</a>.</p>
<p>Judging the competition will be the <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board"><em>BMC Ecology</em> Section Editors</a>, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.</p>
<p>The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.</p>

<p><i>Veteran marketing and business development executives join Science Exchange to help lead the company through its next phase of growth</i></p>
<p><b>PALO ALTO CA, June 14, 2018 –</b>(<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–Science Exchange, the<i> leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;D<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /></i>, has appointed senior team members Rob Mihalko as Vice President of Marketing and Alex Slater as Vice President of Business Development and General Manager Europe. Both executives, reporting to Science Exchange CEO Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., will add to an already talented management team that is driving industry-leading solutions to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research around the world.</p>
<p>Rob Mihalko is a leading expert in business commerce and procurement and has extensive experience in successfully implementing go-to-market strategies for business-to-business marketplaces on a global scale. As VP of Marketing, Mihalko will be responsible for Science Exchange’s worldwide marketing activities. He will lead the way in aligning Science Exchange’s brand and product positioning with global marketing programs to boost awareness, sales and adoption of the company’s industry-leading R&amp;D marketplace.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Science Exchange, Mihalko was Global Vice President of Solution &amp; Customer Marketing for SAP Ariba, where he led marketing and product initiatives that transformed SAP Ariba into the world’s leading procurement and business commerce company. He also has held several senior marketing, product and finance roles with leading technology companies, including Microsoft, and was a management consultant with A.T. Kearney, advising senior executives on strategy, sourcing and supply chain transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to have joined such a passionate and mission-driven team at Science Exchange,” said Mihalko. “I’m looking forward to helping the company build on its leadership position in the outsourced research market and support its growth in new verticals and geographies.”</p>
<p>As a VP of Business Development and General Manager Europe, Alex Slater will be spearheading Science Exchange’s continued expansion into the European market. Slater brings 23 years of business development experience within contract research organizations to Science Exchange, spanning the entirety of drug discovery, from basic research to clinical development. He has also led business development teams in Europe and Asia for Covance and, most recently, was the VP Global Business Development at Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services.</p>
<p>In his new role, Slater will provide key leadership and support of Science Exchange’s business development and expansion efforts in Europe. He will work with the global business development team to stimulate provider and researcher recruitment and expand the European support team that will give researchers the personalized scientific support they expect.</p>
<p>“From my initial interactions with Elizabeth Iorns and the team at Science Exchange, I was impressed by their passion and commitment to simplifying researchers’ access to the services they need,” said Slater. “I look forward to working with such a driven team and helping expand the company’s European presence.”</p>
<p>“We work in a rapidly changing environment, and so it’s critical for us to hire people that share our ambitious vision and have the expertise to help us execute it successfully,” said Elizabeth Iorns, CEO of Science Exchange. “I’m thrilled to be welcoming our two new team members, who each bring vast experience to Science Exchange, and I look forward to working closely with them in our mission to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoothies-2253430_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>How do we make sure that nutrition labels making the 5-a-day claim aren’t being used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy?</p>
<p>The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on processing and fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable and it should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.</p>
<p>Although there are government schemes in place in various countries, manufacturers will sometimes make their own claims on food packaging, which are not covered by government regulations. Provided that manufacturers are following the best practice guidelines for the industry, this should mean that the product contains 80g (or more) of fruit or vegetables in one serving.</p>
<p>Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts of healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.</p>
<p>With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a study, recently published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labelled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.</p>
<p>Two FV product labels were used. Each product label stated the product as a ‘smoothie’, included the smoothie flavor, and stated either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’, using the recognized national UK logo for the 5-a-day FV message. All participants were asked to look at their smoothie before consumption and were required to consume their smoothie in full, although neither the label nor the message were mentioned</p>
<p>Subsequent FV consumption was assessed using 24-h recalls.</p>
<p>The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.</p>
<p>The effect viewed was largely driven by changes in consumption in usual high FV consumers, in females, and in vegetable as opposed to fruit consumption.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Greater regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.</p>

This <a href="https://oaspa.org/dove-medical-press-reinstated-as-oaspa-members/">led to their OASPA membership being reinstated</a>, resulted in an extremely robust peer review process described in detail in their peer review schematic on <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3526">this page</a>. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>In fact, some of the additional checks they have added since that schematic was published go way beyond what most publishers do in their peer review process. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>These are in addition to the usual ethical checks which quality medical journals perform, and include: checking the affiliations of all authors and checking retractionwatch.com to identify whether any of the authors have been involved in unethical practices; manuscripts being checked for duplicate submission or publication and run through the SciDetect software; and IP address checks to make sure that there is no COI between author, reviewer and Editor. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Due diligence</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: Publishing a schematic is surely a good idea.

The timeline is this: Dove joined OASPA in late 2009; Dove withdrew from OASPA on 7th April 2010; Dove applied to join again in May 2012; Dove was re-accepted on 12th July 2012; Dove’s membership was terminated by OASPA on 5th November 2013. Dove reapplied in June 2015 and was accepted on 23rd September 2015.</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>What is not clear is why Dove withdrew from OASPA in 2010. What we do know is that it occurred in the wake of the Amy Bishop affair, in which publicity was given to a controversial paper authored by her and published by </span></i></b><b><span><a href="https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-general-medicine-journal">Dove’s International Journal of General Medicine</a><i>. Controversially, Bishop added the names of her minor children as co-authors of the paper. At the time (February 2010) I <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2010/02/open-access-linked-to-alabama-shooting.html">wrote an article</a> about the incident in which I raised the issue of ownership and transparency, and quoted Peter Suber saying, “I am deeply suspicious of publishers who are unwilling to disclose their owners. We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership. I asked them if they could give me a reason but they gave none.”</i></span></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Here it is worth noting that co-founder of OASPA Gunther Eysenbach <a href="https://oaspa.org/response-to-the-recent-article-in-science/#comment-5201">has repeatedly alleged</a> that Dove engages in “questionable publishing practices”. And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”. (The <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-on-motor-neuron-sur-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM">paper</a> appears to have been reposted later, again with no indication of its disappearance and reappearance).

As I mentioned earlier, Dove also continue to enhance those processes. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: While we are on the historical issues, in 2011 I was contacted by a US-based publisher who said that Dove had on two occasions launched a journal “identical or nearly identical” to this publisher’s own journals. The publisher added that only after a great deal of pressure from them did Dove change the titles of the two copycat journals. The publisher also pointed out that nine of Dove’s journals had the same EiC, many of which journals were unrelated to that EiC’s specialism. I do not know if this is still the case, but can you confirm that Taylor &amp; Francis would not sanction such things? </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><span>DK:</span></b><span> None of the current Dove senior management know anything about this allegation. Dove do have Editors-in-Chief who edit more than one journal, but only in their own specialist area and never more than two or three.

On April 26th Minerva published a <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/weEmCxkVlDi1RJMkEU6eZLm?domain=prnewswire.com">press release</a> alleging that the Dove article makes “material misleading statements” about the nature of the study and that this is “a clear violation of the COPE guidelines”. </i></span></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Writing in STAT, Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky say, “We can’t judge the essence of Minerva’s claims, although some — particularly that paid personnel for a device maker biased the selection process for patients in the trial — are quite troubling and would constitute grounds for retraction.” </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>When I raised this on Twitter, T&amp;F <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/D8IeCyP6mEtr2NXZOtmXtBv?domain=twitter.com">responded</a> that it was “currently working with the editor-in-chief to look into the concerns surrounding this paper”.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/sleep-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Like good diet and exercise, sleep is a critical component to overall health. Current sleep guidelines recommend that adults between the ages of 26 and 64 sleep 7-8 hours per night and practice healthy sleep hygiene which includes limiting daytime naps to 30 minutes, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and energy drinks before bedtime and avoiding heavy or rich foods before bedtime.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that insufficient as well as excessive sleep are associated with health-related conditions such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular events or mortality and stroke.</p>
<p>Metabolic syndrome, which is highly prevalent in Korea, is defined as a metabolic disorder consisting of at least three of the following: elevated waist circumference, high triglyceride levels, low high-density ‘good’ cholesterol levels (HDL-C), hypertension and high fasting glucose.</p>
<p>Researchers at Seoul National University College of Medicine have carried out the largest study examining a dose-response relationship between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome and its components in 133,608 Korean men and women aged 40-69 years. To do this, they used data from the HEXA study, a large-scale community-based study conducted in Korea during the years 2004-2013, which included information on socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, medication use, family history, lifestyle factors, diet, physical activity, and reproductive factors for women.</p>
<p>Sleep duration was assessed by asking the question: “In the past year, on average, how many hours/minutes of sleep (including daytime naps) did you take per day?”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-10227 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/slimming-2728331_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The study, published today in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, finds that compared to individuals who sleep six to seven hours per day, men who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have metabolic syndrome and higher waist circumference. Women who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have higher waist circumference. Furthermore, sleeping more than ten hours per day was associated with metabolic syndrome and increased levels of triglycerides in men, and with metabolic syndrome, higher waist circumference, higher levels of triglycerides and blood sugar, as well as low HDL-C in women.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms for the gender differences observed are unclear but a possible explanation is that women experiencing menopausal transition face erratic fluctuations and eventual decline in estrogens as well as ovarian estradiol which may lead to frequent sleep disruptions, a common characteristic of long sleep duration. Another theory is that women may have shorter circadian periods which contributes to higher insomnia.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10228 alignleft" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/macaron-2462247_640-300x169.jpg" width="300" />The biological mechanisms that underlie the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome are also unclear but potential factors include levels of hormones which increase appetite and caloric intake or reduce energy expenditure in people who sleep less than seven hours per day, which may lead to increased waist circumference and development of obesity.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the cross-sectional, observational nature of this study does not allow for conclusions about cause and effect. Estimates of sleep duration were based on self-report data rather than objective measures and may reflect ‘time in bed’, actual time spent asleep or time people believed they slept. Also, as the study did not distinguish between daytime naps and nighttime sleep, their impact on health could not be assessed separately.</p>

<p><em>This is an excerpt from the Introduction to <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness</a>. Also published in the UK and Ireland as <a href="https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409173199" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demystifying the Female Brain. A neuroscientist explores health, hormones and happiness.</a> </em></p>
<hr />
<p>Mother Nature is selfish. Her one and only goal is for us to have sex to make babies. To ensure dating and mating occurs, the parts of our brain that control reproduction, in particular, the hypothalamus, become ‘masculinised’ or ‘feminised’ to match our male or female gonads.</p>
<h2>Sex hormones organise the prenatal brain</h2>
<p>Hormones influence how these reproductive brain circuits grow and respond. Prenatal life is the first of two life phases when the brain is super sensitive to sex hormones.</p>
<p>We call this early period of hormone exposure the <em>organisational</em> period, as it organises or programs the brain to respond to hormones in adulthood. Many sex differences that do exist are developmentally organised and then <em>activated,</em> or <em>revealed</em>, by the action of hormones at puberty.</p>
<h2>Is the female brain the ‘default’ option?</h2>
<p>During the prenatal period, the dominating influence is that of testosterone produced by foetal testes. Testosterone helps to ensure that the reproductive regions of the brain in males becomes masculinised.</p>
<p>At the same time, and in the <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>absence</em></span> of testosterone, brain regions involved in reproductive behaviours in females become feminised.</p>
<p>In other words, in the <em>absence</em> of a Y chromosome, the default developmental option is for the foetus to become a female.</p>
<p>‘Default’ is a term some people find a little dismissive.</p>
<p>To help unravel the complexities of male versus female prenatal brain development, I called Margaret McCarthy, a professor of neuroscience who studies the effects of hormones on brain development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. McCarthy is one of the pioneers in the field and conducted some of the first studies on how sex hormones organise the developing brain.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Default does not mean passive!”</p></blockquote>
<p>McCarthy said to me in a tone of voice that had me quickly convinced she’s made that statement more than once.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Try using ‘The developing mammalian brain is <em>destined </em>for a female phenotype’, instead!” she said</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>In the <em>absence</em> of a Y chromosome, all embryos are <em>destined</em> to become female.</strong></p>
<h2>What is the role of oestrogen in female brain development?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering, if testosterone ‘masculinises’ the unborn baby boy, what role does oestrogen from foetal ovaries play in ‘feminising’ the unborn baby girl?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, foetal oestrogen plays no role at all. Female embryos do not require ovarian hormones to become feminised (remember, they’re <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>destined </em></span>to become female). Oestrogen’s role in the developing female brain is thus a by-product of its <em>absence</em>, rather than presence.</p>
<p>Unborn babies’ brains are also shielded from the influence of maternal oestrogens (made by their mother and the placenta) by a molecule called alpha-fetoprotein, which is made in the liver of an unborn baby. It binds to oestrogen in the bloodstream and prevents maternal oestrogen crossing into the baby’s brain.</p>
<p>Curiously, oestrogen is involved in organising the architecture of the <em>male </em>brain. Testosterone easily passes into unborn baby boy’s brains where it is converted to oestradiol by an enzyme called aromatase. It is now well established the ‘female’ hormone oestradiol is responsible for ‘masculinising’ the male brain in utero.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Nature is selfish. And she also has a sense of humour.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This is an excerpt from Chapter One of <strong><em>The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness.</em></strong> Later in the chapter, I explain why <em>supposed</em> sex differences in achievement in maths, interest in technology subjects or ability in the sciences cannot be attributed to the presence (or absence) of testosterone in the womb. In sum: the role of hormones can be enhanced or entirely eliminated by how girls and boys are raised.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/11/does-depression-accelerate-aging/">Does Depression Accelerate Aging?</a></h4>

<p>A clear association between depression, especially the major depressive disorder, oxidative stress, and accelerated aging is supported by research.</p>
<p>Depression, major depressive disorder more specifically, is one of the most striking problems of modern society. Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression, with many patients not experiencing relief from symptoms. Depression is associated with increased mortality from age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Researchers have suggested that depression is associated with increased oxidative stress and a disturbed immune response, which may accelerate aging and increase susceptibility to age-related disorders.</p>
<p>One of the proven indicators of cellular aging is the length of telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the end of chromosomal DNA and serve to protect chromosomal integrity. They become shorter with each round of replication and cell division, meaning that normally they become shorter with age. When telomeres reach a critically short length, the cells undergo apoptosis, i.e., programmed death. Leukocyte telomere length has been typically used in clinical studies as a marker of cellular aging. They shortening accelerates in the cells subjected to oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Multiple studies, including some meta-analysis, have questioned the association between leukocyte telomere length and major depressive disorder. For instance, one meta-analysis compared the length of telomeres between depressed and healthy individuals and found significantly shorter telomeres in groups with depression. A very recent prospective study including over 100 participants aged from 18 to 70 with or without major depressive disorder assessed telomere length at baseline and at two years follow-up. The authors concluded that individuals with major depressive disorder at baseline had significantly larger shortening of telomeres over the period of 2 years, supporting the association between depression and accelerated aging.</p>
<p>Major depressive disorder is typically classified as a mental illness, but its pathology is evident in cells throughout the body. According to some researchers, several biological mediators are deregulated in this disorder that contribute to accelerated aging. These changes affect levels of genetic and epigenetic mediators (i.e., the variants of genes), and biochemical mediators such as glucocorticoids and neurosteroids. This can alter immune functions, oxidative processes, and levels of factors regulating the metabolism of glucose and production of insulin.</p>
<p>It is evident that deregulation of some of these biological mediators leads to oxidative stress, which seems to be highly correlated with the aging process. Oxidative damage occurs when the body can’t cope with psychological and physical stressors. In other words, oxidative stress refers to the excessive production of free radicals that cannot be completely neutralized by the body’s antioxidative mechanisms. Elevated markers of oxidative stress, along with  decreased antioxidant capacity, have been reported in subjects with depression.</p>
<p>Oxidative damage is associated with the aging process, while markers of oxidative stress correlate with the decreased activity of an enzyme called telomerase. This enzyme is responsible for extending the length of telomeres. When telomerase is absent, the telomeres shorten faster. Thus, the link between the depression and accelerated aging can partly be explained by an increased cellular oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Animal studies have also been conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder-mediated accelerated aging. For instance, in one study, the researchers exposed rats to mild chronic stress in order to induce the symptoms of major depressive disorder. The animals that developed these symptoms were found to have shorter telomeres and decreased telomerase activity, along with an increase in oxidative damage and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. In addition, damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial DNA content were also reported in rats with depressive symptoms. This research provided clear cellular evidence of accelerated aging associated with major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>A group of researchers proposed that early treatment (i.e., in the first half of life) of psychiatric disorders, including depression, could extend life expectancy and significantly reduce the burden of age-related disorders (such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer). They demonstrated that the persistence of some psychiatric disorder from the ages of 11 to 38 years led to the dose-dependent shortening of telomere length by the age of 38. Analyses of blood samples collected at the age of 26 and 38 revealed an accelerated erosion of telomeric ends in males diagnosed with the psychiatric disorder such as depression. Interestingly, there was no such association in females with a psychiatric disorder in the interim assessment at the age of 26. This research points to the link between psychiatric disorders and accelerated biological aging, which may be particularly emphasized in men.</p>
<p>Recently, one study investigated the association between major depressive disorder and age-related changes of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures involved in reward processing, which is often dysfunctional in subjects with major depressive disorder. Based on images from the brains of patients with depression and healthy controls, the authors assessed the grey matter volume of basal ganglia in their different parts. They found a negative correlation between the size of the putamen (a region of the basal ganglia located in the base of the forebrain) and age. Importantly, this association was twice as big in patients with major depressive disorder in comparison with healthy subjects. The finding of a greater age-related volume decrease in the depressed subjects, suggests that major depressive syndrome is clearly associated with accelerated aging.</p>
<p>It seems that although various biochemical mediators are responsible for the clear association between depression and accelerated aging, oxidative stress is the largest contributor to this phenomenon. Thus, it is most likely that cellular oxidative damage caused by different psychological and physical stressors represents the underlying mechanism of depression-related accelerated aging.</p>

<p>K-Nearest Neighbor, KNN is well-known tool in data mining. KNN query returns objects in a data set that are nearest to a query object-q.  One of the shortcomings of KNN is that it is asymmetric. That is, the fact that a query point q has a data point p as its nearest neighbor does not imply that p’s nearest neighbor is q.  There may be the case in decision support system where we concern on finding influence set for a query object q. For example, opening  a new outlet of company A at particular location is more based on the segment of customers of company B ( competitor of A) who are likely to find new outlet more convenient that the location of B.  Such segments of customers can loosely refer as influence set and the reverse relationship is addressed by reverse nearest neighbor, RNN.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9552">"The Love of Neuroscience" and the Neuroscience of Love</a></h4>

There is a growing research literature on the 'Neuroscience of Love'. But what exactly is this 'love' that is being studied?





Sociologist Gabriel Abend asks these questions in a new paper called The Love of Neuroscience published in Sociological Theory. Last year I discussed one of Abend's previous papers which asked more general questions about how neuroscientists define the objects they study. In the new paper, Abend looks specifically at 'love' and how this word has been understood

Children with food allergies are more likely to have autism than kids without, a study finds. But that doesn’t mean a child will develop the disorder.

<p>The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the largest non-governmental funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and PLOS ONE, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to announce the successful completion of the first funding cycle of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Report (DDIRR) 2017 Awards, a funder-publisher partnership integrating the Registered Reports model into the grant application process.</p>
<p>Registered Reports pre-determine the research questions, methodology and design of a study to be carried out, and are designed to enhance the rigor, reproducibility and transparency of the science produced. CTF and PLOS ONE partnered together to review the 2017 DDIRR applications and granted three awards: Dr. Andrea McClatchey of Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Lei Xu of Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dr. Aaron Schindeler from the University of Sydney. The researchers also obtained an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal PLOS ONE. Provided the study is conducted according to plan, acceptance in principle is honored regardless of study outcome – thereby eliminating publication bias and maximizing the transparency of the funded work.</p>
<p>The reports are being placed on the Open Science Framework registered report portal (<a href="https://osf.io/rr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://osf.io/rr/</a>), where authors will have the opportunity to make public or embargo their reports until publication of results. The awards have a duration of 12 months and will conclude in May 2019. As soon as results are added to the registered report, PLOS ONE will review compliance with the proposed protocol and publish their results, even if they are negative. By securing publication before they start their research, applicants can eliminate the bias of a result-based approach. The process was designed to maintain independence of funding and publishing decisions, while at the same time optimizing processes, thereby avoiding duplication and preventing research waste.</p>
<p>This new award constitutes an evolution of the Drug Discovery Initiative (DDI) Awards that CTF had introduced in 2006 as a funding program for promising ideas that could lead to larger studies or move drugs into the clinic. Feedback on the new DDIRR program from both applicants and reviewers has been unanimously positive, and the Foundation together with PLOS ONE editors have also announced a new cycle for DDIRR in 2018-2019. The Foundation will invite applicants to submit their proposals starting on September 24, 2018, with the anticipated assignment of new awards in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>“The overall outcome of this first round of DDIRR has been very positive. Reviewers have focused their attention to protocols and study designs, allowing researchers to have their statistics ready for publication,” said Salvatore La Rosa, Ph.D., Vice President of Research and Development for the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “As this particular grant program focuses on hypothesis-testing research, the quality and rigor of the applications are critical to soundly move proof-of-concept experiments from the lab into the clinic. This new program increases our ability to do that.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to continue our collaboration with CTF on the Registered Reports model for the DDI Awards. We hope this can serve as a model for other funders. The Registered Reports provide researchers with peer reviewed study designs and an in-principle acceptance of the completed study at PLOS ONE. The deposited reports at the Open Science Framework portal ensure full transparency of the research project – a win for everyone involved,” adds Joerg Heber, Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550863108/0/oupblogpsychology/">Studying mass murder</a></h4>

<p>In the twentieth century, 40 to 60 million defenseless people were massacred in episodes of genocide. The 21st century is not faring much better, with mass murder ongoing e.g. in Myanmar and Syria. Many of these cases have been studied well, both in detailed case studies and in comparative perspectives, but studying mass murder is no picnic. Scholars have also examined how <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520089945" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conducting research</a>, including ethnographic fieldwork, archival investigation, and oral history interviews, can affect the researcher in profound ways. Among a broader set of difficulties that obstruct research on this wretched subject, two stand out in particular: political constraints and psychological attrition.</p>
<p><strong>Political constraints</strong></p>
<p>All social research operates in a dense political field. Of all the political actors constraining research on mass murder, states stand out. They often have a vested interest in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.nl/books?id=A0QlDwAAQBAJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">misrepresenting the truth</a>, because for many, the memory of a genocide (or its denial), is part and parcel of their collective identity. States that consider themselves heirs to perpetrator regimes, such as Turkey, Russia, Indonesia, China, or Serbia, make great effort to influence the scholarship on episodes of mass violence. They deny access to archival collections and libraries, intimidate and prohibit them from conducting field work. (The opposite is also possible: governments may try to foster or manipulate research by funding politically useful research, by pushing for the establishment of academic chairs at home or abroad, or by offering scholarships.)</p>
<p>Having to contend with the taboos, restrictions, prescriptions, and outright threats of authoritarian regimes keeps scholars working on these topics under <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.2016.97.issue-4/issuetoc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">permanent threat</a>. Researchers bold enough to travel into these societies to visit sites, uncover evidence, interview witnesses, and have got to fear the security services and intelligence agencies of these states. One consequence of this discouraging atmosphere is that, in general, less research is carried out on those instances and episodes of mass murder, an undesirable blind spot due to the importance of the events. (Some researchers ingratiate themselves with the authorities for privileged access.) A second consequence poses a methodological dilemma: due to such constraints, does one launch a sting operation, like undercover journalism? Or does one use informants, fixers, and mediators on the ground? Does one pay the possible interviewees for taking the risks?</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote"> We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges. </blockquote></div>
<p><strong>Psychological consequences</strong></p>
<p>There are significant emotional consequences of studying mass murder. All social research also operates in a dense emotional and moral field. As a general problem in the academy, involvement and detachment has been dealt with at some length, but the study of mass violence is particularly relevant from this perspective. Though a certain amount of passion and involvement can facilitate one’s commitment to the topic, it requires a great deal of detachment to sift through documents and memoirs containing very intimate details of killing. Detachment is even more challenging in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14525.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews</a>, as empathy can transmit to scholars the interviewees’ powerful negative emotions.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, I began interviewing Syrians about their experiences with violence, as part of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://niod.nl/en/news/new-research-project-syrians%E2%80%99-experiences-mass-violence-and-dynamic-violent-conflict" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a large-scale oral history project</a> we are launching in the Netherlands. Having interviewed about 80 survivors and eye witnesses so far, their emotions of anger, sadness, fear, survivor guilt, and anxiety has affected me irreversibly. These types of interviews can be an alienating and isolating experience: the more one is absorbed into the stories of the eye witnesses, the more one is also drawn into their emotions. As a general rule of thumb, I felt compassion when interviewing victims, and indignation when interviewing perpetrators. But the interviews left a mark long after I stopped recording. When one young woman from Aleppo told me that she was raped in an ambush and witnessed a beheading up close, I was aghast at that moment. Ever since, I have not mustered my courage to go over those particular interview transcripts and notes.</p>
<p>All in all, the risks of political threats and psychological attrition need to be taken seriously by academic institutions, journals, and colleagues. These constraints can produce setbacks and potentially lower productivity, even with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/11/on-burnout-trauma-erin-jessee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appropriate self-care</a>. We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIPAA Compliance Demonstrates Commitment by Science Exchange to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protection and Privacy of Protected Health Information</span></i></p>
<p><b>PALO ALTO CA, June 7, 2018 –</b><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced that it is the first R&amp;D outsourcing platform to achieve HIPAA compliance as required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under 45 C.F.R. 164. This achievement demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by 45 CFR §160.103 and shared by its customers and scientific research providers on the Science Exchange platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Protecting sensitive patient health information is a top priority for our clients and research providers,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “Achieving HIPAA compliance was a crucial step for Science Exchange, given the increasing portability and complexity of data processed by our software platform.”  </span></p>
<p><b>HIPAA and HITECH: Noncompliance costing millions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act limit the disclosure of patient PHI, including data processed by any provider, technology platform, or other contractor. Since 2010, enforcement of HIPAA and HITECH has increased — with individual fines for noncompliance as high as $2 million. HIPAA compliance helps protect Science Exchange’s clients from these potential consequences.</span></p>
<p><b>Science Exchange achieved HIPAA compliance by:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing Business Associate Agreements for proper use and disclosure of PHI: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Associate Agreements are required agreements between covered entities and their business associates, such as Science Exchange, whose activities involve access to PHI</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards against improper disclosures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training every employee on protecting information subject to HIPAA and HIPAA requirements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting best practices for limiting information use and sharing</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Industry leaders in data privacy, security, and quality assurance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being the only HIPAA-compliant R&amp;D outsourcing platform, Science Exchange is also the only outsourcing platform to have earned EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification. This certification ensures compliance with the <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/gdpr-plan">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations</a> that went into effect on May 25, 2018, thereby protecting the many R&amp;D organizations that have enterprise-level agreements with Science Exchange. Science Exchange is also SOC 2-compliant and ISO 9001-certified.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550638442/0/oupblogpsychology/">Safe and supportive schools for LGBTQ-GNC students</a></h4>

<p>Within its first month, the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines designed to promote protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or gender non-conforming youth (LGBTQ-GNC) public school students. This move received significant media attention, much of which focused on the challenges of growing up LGBTQ-GNC, and the unique role of schools as places that should be safe and supportive for all students. At issue is defining the rights of students to be protected based on LGBT-GNC identity or status. And yet these rights are regularly compromised through: harassment and victimization that is unchecked; unfair, punitive, and exclusionary discipline practices; and unequal access to supports, services, and curriculum that validate their identities and experiences.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking study, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uslgbt/toc.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Hatred in the Hallways</em></a><em>, </em>documented pervasive human rights violations perpetrated against LGBT youth in US schools. More recently, through an international convening and report, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) firmly documented homophobic and transphobic violence as a global issue that has critical implications for positive development, health, and academic success of children and adolescence. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~en.unesco.org/themes/school-violence-and-bullying/homophobic-transphobic-violence" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UNESCO report</a> argued that bullying generally, and bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) specifically, comprise a threat to the universal right to education established in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. This groundbreaking report provided a comprehensive review of the international literature on SOGI-related bullying in schools and documented the disproportionate rates of bullying for LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries on every continent across the globe.</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote">
<p>While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people.</p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>Although the landscape regarding human rights affordances, constraints, and abuses related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is constantly in flux, any discussion of the SOGI rights of young people must take into account this larger global context. The rights of LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries where the expression of same-sex sexuality is criminalized are virtually non-existent; further, human rights violations against LGBTQ-GNC youth occur within most countries across the globe and are often justified by cultural and social norms and conventions regarding “acceptable or normal” definitions of sexuality and gender. While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people. While several advances have been made in the last decade to advance the rights of LGBTQ-GNC people across the globe (for example see the 2006 Yogykarta Principles and the 2011 Human Rights Council’s resolution on LGBTQ-GNC rights) these documents rarely attend to specific SOGI rights of <em>young people</em> or put forth any particular considerations regarding children and youth (a notable exception is in relation to access to education).</p>
<p>Understanding intersecting forms of oppression—such as the ways that structural oppression related to gender and sexuality and its intersections with race, ethnicity, class, and religion affect young people, their parents, and educators in schools—is essential for designing and implementing effective processes, strategies, programs, and advocacy aimed at creating positive change within school contexts. Many of the SOGI-related inequities evidenced in schools can be traced, in part, to narrow definitions of masculinity and femininity, rigid frameworks regarding gender and gender roles, and hegemonic structures in schools that mark heterosexuality as not only compulsory but also the sole valid expression of sexuality. Other forms of structural oppression rooted in racism, religious, or social class bias, are intertwined with SOGI issues in schools through inequitable discipline practices, religious control of public education, or economic disparities across schools.</p>
<p>Because SOGI issues in schools are embedded within larger systems of oppression, it is critical that research, practice, and policy engage with social justice and anti-oppressive education frameworks. Such approaches bring to the fore the ways that power, privilege, and bias structure schools in ways that tacitly sanction a range of educational inequities such as bullying, access to resources and services, and safety for young people in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. As we continue to do this work, it has become increasingly evident that the SOGI safe schools movement is “inextricably linked” to broader education justice concerns. It is critical for the safe schools movement to work with others through intersectional, multi-issue coalitions—at the nexus of research, policy and practice—to ensure that all students’ educational rights, regardless of social position, are upheld. This type of cross-issue organizing, advocacy, and research takes time and needs to be grounded in the principals of the worth and dignity of all people, and that ensuring the rights of specific groups expands the rights of everyone.</p>
