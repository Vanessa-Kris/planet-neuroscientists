<p>Sports coaches are always on the look out for new ideas to improve their players’ performance and it’s understandable that insights from psychology and neuroscience hold particular appeal. However, as with other applied fields, it’s not easy to translate neuroscience findings into useful sports interventions. There are also a lot of charlatans who use the mystique of the brain to sell quack sports products and programmes. Without specialist neuroscience training, coaches might struggle to distinguish genuine brain insights from neuro-based flimflam.</p>
<p>It’s in this context that a group of researchers, led by Richard Bailey at the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education in Berlin, thought it would be useful to see which scientifically challenged practices sports coaches use, and whether they are able to identify brain facts from myths. Previous work has identified widespread belief in neuromyths among several other groups, including <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/05/belief-in-brain-myths-and-child-development-myths-continues-even-among-those-whove-studied-psychology/">psychology students</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/19/music-teachers-and-students-fall-for-music-related-neuromyths-german-study/">music teachers</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/">neuroscience graduates</a>, but this is the first time sports coaches have been tested.</p>
<p>Reporting their results in <em><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00641/full">Frontiers in Psychology</a></em>, Bailey and his colleagues found that sports coaches endorsed, on average, just over 40 per cent of the six brain myths presented to them. “The figure is substantial enough to warrant concern,” according to Bailey and his colleagues “because it is likely that these beliefs will shape coaching philosophy and practice.”</p>
<p><span id="more-33846"></span></p>
<p>The findings are based on a survey of nearly 550 coaches in the UK and Ireland who took part by responding to adverts on social media. They coached a range of sports including football, rugby, swimming and cricket.</p>
<p>The coaches reported using the scientifically unsupported concept of “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">learning styles</a>” frequently and this also happened to be the neuromyth that they endorsed most strongly (over 62 per cent of the coaches said they agreed with the concept). Around half also endorsed the idea that short bursts of coordination exercises can improve the integration of left and right-hemishphere brain function, which chimes with the fact they said they made frequent use of the pseudoscientific Brain Gym programme that espouses this idea.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the coaches reported only infrequent use of the empirically challenged approaches of NLP, the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory and Action Types Approach, while they made frequent use of the more scientifically legitimate techniques/approaches of direct instruction, guided discovery, demonstrations and growth mindset.</p>
<p>Turning to the other myths on the list, 43 percent and 55 per cent of the coaches said they believed in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die">left-brain, right-brain myth</a> and the myth that children are less attentive after consuming sugar, respectively. In contrast, their endorsement was much lower for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/">10 per cent brain myth</a> and the myth that there are critical periods in childhood after which things can no longer be learned (22.6 and 16.6 per cent of them endorsed these myths, respectively, on average).</p>
<p>The researchers also presented the coaches with six “general assertions” about the brain that are scientifically supported, including that vigorous exercise can improve mental function. On average, the coaches agreed with 56.6 per cent of these more evidence-based statements, although fewer than 10 per cent realised that boys have bigger brains than girls and fewer than 20 per cent realised that the two brain hemispheres always work together.</p>
<p>Previous research on misbeliefs about the brain has found that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing – for instance, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=teachers#v=snippet&amp;q=teachers&amp;f=false">belief in brain myths was previously found to be higher among teachers with more general knowledge about the brain</a>. This pattern was replicated here among sports coaches – those with superior brain knowledge, and those who thought neuroscience was more likely to be helpful for their work, also tended to believe more in the neuromyths.</p>
<p>Bailey and his colleagues end with a number of recommendations to combat neuro-bunk in sports coaching, including increasing contact between coaches and scientists and establishing an independent advisory body for sports governing bodies, akin to the UK’s National Institute for Health Care Excellence that provides evidence-based guidelines to health professionals. More generally, “coach education should be strengthened by encouraging the cultivation of a healthy scepticism,” they concluded. “As the first of its kind with sports coaches, this study can be understood as a contribution to these endeavours”, they concluded.</p>

A prominent (yet controversial) journalist in Australia has admitted to duplicating three images that were part of her PhD thesis — a practice outside experts agreed was acceptable, if not ideal, at the time, according to a report released today. As part of an inquiry, the University of Adelaide convened an expert panel to investigate … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/09/controversial-australian-science-journalist-admits-to-duplication-in-her-phd-thesis/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Controversial Australian science journalist admits to duplication in her PhD thesis</span></a>

<p>The idea that taking a gap year allows you to “find yourself” is often derided. But if you spend that time living in one foreign country, it just might. And if you can make it year<i>s</i>, even better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hajo Adam at Rice University, US, led what his team say is the first empirical investigation of the effects of living abroad on “self-concept clarity” – how clearly and confidently someone defines who they “are”. Since people are increasingly spending time living abroad for work or study – and since other “transitional” life experiences, such as getting a new job or getting divorced have been associated with <i>decreases</i> in self-concept clarity – it’s important to study this, the researchers write in their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597817301279">paper</a> in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-33848"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited a total of 1,874 people to take part in a series of studies. The first involved 296 people, recruited online. Half had lived abroad at some point. They all completed a 12-item self-concept clarity scale, indicating the extent to which they did or didn’t agree with statements like: “In general, I have a clear sense of who I am and what I am” and “I seldom experience conflict between the different aspects of my personality”. Those who had lived abroad had a clearer self-concept.</p>
<p>But might this be because this type of person is more likely to pursue opportunities abroad? To find out, the team recruited 261 more people, 136 of whom had lived abroad. The others hadn’t yet, but had definite plans to, with most intending to move within around nine months. As well as the self-concept clarity scale, participants completed an assessment of their “self-discerning reflections” – such as: “I have figured out if my relationships with others are driven by my own values or follow the values of those around me” and “I have determined whether my personality is defined by who I truly am or by the culture I grew up in”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Those participants who’d already lived abroad had clearer self-concepts than the others who shared the same plans to live abroad but hadn’t travelled yet, and this was explained statistically by their higher scores for self-discerning reflections (this was after controlling for a range of demographic and personality variables). These results suggest that time abroad increases self-discerning reflection and in turn this leads to greater self concept clarity.</p>
<p>Other studies the researchers conducted, including in some cases with students from dozens of different countries, led them to conclude that it’s total time spent living abroad – rather than the number of different countries lived in – that makes for greater self-concept clarity (among these participants the average time spent living abroad was 3.3 years). Greater clarity can also have a practical advantage: international students who’d spent more time living abroad reported feeling clearer about their future career direction, an outcome that was mediated by increased self-concept clarity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The fact that we found consistent support for our hypotheses across different subject populations…mixed methods…and complementary methods of self-concept clarity…highlights the robustness of living abroad on self-concept clarity”, the researchers write. “The present research is the first to show that living abroad can change structural aspects of the self-concept.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other research has found that living abroad can influence the content of a person’s self-concept – with words such as “adventurous” being added to their self-descriptions. But the new findings suggest that, because living abroad, away from your usual cultural environment, allows you to confront and perhaps redefine what truly is and isn’t important to you, it also leads to improved confidence in and clarity about who you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the longer you live abroad, the more self-discerning reflections you’re likely to have, the researchers write.</p>
<p>The paper concludes with a quote from a 1919 book called <i>Travel Diaries of a Philosopher</i> by German philosopher Hermann von Keyserling: “The shortest path to oneself leads around the world.” The researchers add: “Almost 100 years later, our research provides empirical evidence in support of this idea.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>What is nationality? Is it something fixed that we inherit biologically from our parents or is it a characteristic that we can change and acquire? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0334-3">new study</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> is the first to study people’s “folk theories” about nationality – based on surveys of US and Indian participants – and the results show that, at least in these countries, people are broadly sympathetic toward both these contrasting theories of nationality at the same time, although with a bias toward the fluid theory.</p>
<p>The relative strength of people’s endorsement of the theories at any given time depended on the way questions about nationality were framed, the researchers found. Moreover, and perhaps most interesting for future investigation, the results showed people’s ideas about nationality were tied to their attitudes toward immigration, even after factoring out any differences in political leanings.</p>
<p><span id="more-33830"></span></p>
<p>Mostafa Rad and Jeremy Ginges at the New School for Social Research and Princeton University surveyed a total of 2013 US participants and 732 Indian participants. They presented the participants with variations of the following scenario:</p>
<p><em>Please imagine the following: A child is born to Pakistani parents but is orphaned at birth. When the child is one day old, they are adopted and raised by an American family and are never told about their origin.”</em></p>
<p>Next, the participants were asked, “all things considered”, to rate how much, from 0 to 100 per cent, the child will match the nationality of his or her birth parents, or – in a different framing – they were asked to make the same assessment for how much the child will match the nationality of their adoptive parents (debriefing clarified that, as hoped, the participants were considering nationality, not citizenship – which depends on more obvious and explicit legal stipulations that vary in different countries).</p>
<p>The participants’ views on what governs nationality varied according to the framing of the question – on the one hand, they stated on average that the child would share 77.8 per cent (US participants) or 74.2 per cent (Indian participants) of their adoptive parents’ nationality, suggesting a fluid view of nationality. Yet, when the question was framed around the birth parents’ nationality, the participants also stated that the child would share 39 percent (US participants) or 45.4 per cent (Indian participants) of their birth parents’ nationality, on average, indicative of a more fixed, genetic-based folk theory of nationality.</p>
<p>Varying the scenario wording so that the birth and adoptive parents’ skin colour was the same or different (based on ethnic and national stereotypes) made little difference to participants’ rates of agreement with both the fluid and genetic folk theories of nationality.</p>
<p>The results suggest that, at least in the US and India, a lot of people hold in their heads two contradictory theories about the roots of nationality at the same time.</p>
<p>“Cultural evolution may have favored such flexible reasoning about the acquisition of nationality,” the researchers said, “as the ‘malleable’ theory allows for a rapid expansion of the group, whereas the ‘fixed’ theory suggests an inborn and immutable essence that gives a sense that nationality is more than a mere social contract but an ineffable primordial attachment encouraging deep moral commitments.”</p>
<p>Rad and Ginges were able to explore some of these dynamics by tweaking the wording of the question that they put to participants. For instance, they tried out versions in which the child’s birth parents happened to share the participant’s own nationality (while the child’s adopted parents had another nationality), and versions in which this was reversed, so that it was the child’s adopted parents who shared the participant’s own nationality.</p>
<p>Results for these different permutations of the vignette showed that participants generally saw their own nationality as harder to relinquish but easier to acquire, as compared with a foreign nationality (which they saw as easier to lose, but harder to gain). In the era of Brexit and Trump’s “great, great wall” these results may surprise some: “… [F]olk theories of nationality are biased towards immigration and against emigration, perhaps facilitating ingroup expansion,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>At the same time, as you might have predicted, the results showed that, in terms of differences between individuals in the strength of their belief in the different folk theories, those people who more strongly endorsed a fixed or genetic-based theory of nationality tended to have more hostile attitudes toward immigration, even after factoring out any differences in political leanings.</p>
<p>“Future work could build on our results to model social and political factors that may influence the distributive strength of malleable versus fixed conceptions of nationality,” the researchers concluded, “helping us to predict variations in attitudes towards migration across time and context.”</p>

A new scandal hit the world of psychology last week when it emerged that Robert J. Sternberg, an eminent experimental psychologist and former President of the American Psychological Association (APA), has been engaging in text recycling aka self-plagiarism.





It has emerged that Sternberg re-used large chunks of previously published text in several publications without any acknowledgement that this done. This discovery came after Sternberg was already under scrutiny for a very high rate

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXX) Is the brain a computer?</a></h4>

<p>It is sometimes stated as an obvious fact that the brain carries out computations. Computational neuroscientists sometimes see themselves as looking for the algorithms of the brain. Is it true that the brain implements algorithms? My point here is not to answer this question, but rather to show that the answer is not self-evident, and that it can only be true (if at all) at a fairly abstract level.</p>
<p>One line of argumentation is that models of the brain that we find in computational neuroscience (neural network models) are algorithmic in nature, since we simulate them on computers. And wouldn’t it be a sort of vitalistic claim that neural networks cannot be (in principle) simulated on computer?</p>
<p>There is an important confusion in this argument. At a low level, neural networks are modelled biophysically as dynamical systems, in which the temporality corresponds to the actual temporality of the real world (as opposed to the discrete temporality of algorithms). Mathematically, those are typically differential equations, possibly hybrid systems (i.e. coupled by timed pulses), in which time is a continuous variable. Those models can of course be simulated on computer using discretization schemes. For example, we choose a time step and compute the state of the network at time t+dt, from the state at time t. This algorithm, however, implements a simulation of the model; it is not the model that implements the algorithm. The discretization is nowhere to be found in the model. The model itself, being a continuous time dynamical system, is not algorithmic in nature. It is not described as a discrete sequence of operations; it is only the simulation of the model that is algorithmic, and different algorithms can simulate the same model.</p>
<p>If we put this confusion aside, then the claim that neural networks implement algorithms becomes not that obvious. It means that trajectories of the dynamical system can be mapped to the discrete flow of an algorithm. This requires: 1) to identify states with representations of some variables (for example stimulus properties, symbols); 2) to identify trajectories from one state to another as specific operations. In addition to that, for the algorithmic view to be of any use, there should be a sequence of operations, not just one operation (ie, describing the output as a function of the input is not an algorithmic description).</p>
<p>A key difficulty in this identification is temporality: the state of the dynamical system changes continuously, so how can this be mapped to discrete operations? A typical approach is neuroscience is to consider not states but properties of trajectories. For example, one would consider the average firing rate in a population of neurons in a given time window, and the rate of another population in another time window. The relation between these two rates in the context of an experiment would define an operation. As stated above, a sequence of such relations should be identified in order to qualify as an algorithm. But this mapping seems only possible within a feedforward flow; coupling poses a greater challenge for an algorithmic description. No known nervous system, however, has a feedforward connectome.</p>
<p>I am not claiming here that the function of the brain (or mind) cannot possibly be described algorithmically. Probably some of it can be. My point is rather that a dynamical system is not generically algorithmic. A control system, for example, is typically not algorithmic (see the detailed example of Tim van Gelder, <em><a href="http://people.bu.edu/pbokulic/class/vanGelder-reading.pdf">What might cognition be if not computation?</a></em>). Thus a neural dynamical system can only be seen as an algorithm at a fairly abstract level, which can probably address only a restricted subset of its function. It could be that control, which also attaches function to dynamical systems, is a more adequate metaphor of brain function than computation. Is the brain a computer? Given the rather narrow application of the algorithmic view, the reasonable answer should be: quite clearly not (maybe part of cognition could be seen as computation, but not brain function generally).</p>

<p>The foods we eat can have a huge impact on our brain’s function. Neuroscientists show that rats fed junk foods <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/8/5307/htm">struggle with memory tasks</a>. We also know that memory function is impaired in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023100">people who eat junk foods</a>, regardless of whether they are overweight or not.</p>
<p>But aside from cutting out junk foods, is there neuroscience-based evidence that specific foods can help boost brain function?</p>
<p><em>In part Part 5 of our <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/">series on the gut-brain axis</a>, diet and brain health, Dr Amy Reichelt dicusses five “famous superfoods” that science shows can benefit your brain.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Blueberries</h2>
<p>Blueberries are often called a quintessential “superfood” because of their potent antioxidant properties. Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in the compound <em>anthocyanin</em>, a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52524-flavonoids.html">flavonoid</a> with potent antioxidant capacity. Anthocyanin is the chemical that gives many berries and fruits their bright purple or red colour.</p>
<p>Antioxidants combat the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20955649">oxidation and inflammation that damages brain cells (neurons). </a>Our stressful urban lifestyles can increase free radicals causing inflammation and neuron damage in the brain. So <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/antioxidants#lp-h-3">diets high in antioxidants</a> may help reverse mental decline.</p>
<h2>Avocados</h2>
<p>Avocados are high in monosaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Diets high in MUFAs are often called “Mediterranean diets” and have documented benefits for the brain and cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>MUFAs can increase the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07772.x/asset/j.1471-4159.2012.07772.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=jcy80el0&amp;s=b43bab92a1b2d811a5cb78794e02baa76c9a0e20&amp;systemMessage=Please+be+advised+that+we+experienced+an+unexpected+issue+that+occurred+on+Saturday+and+Sunday+January+20th+and+21st+that+caused+the+site+to+be+down+for+an+extended+period+of+time+and+affected+the+ability+of+users+to+access+content+on+Wiley+Online+Library.+This+issue+has+now+been+fully+resolved.++We+apologize+for+any+inconvenience+this+may+have+caused+and+are+working+to+ensure+that+we+can+alert+you+immediately+of+any+unplanned+periods+of+downtime+or+disruption+in+the+future.">neurotransmitter acetylcholine</a> in the brain. Acetylcholine is critical for learning, memory and concentration. Reduced brain acetylcholine contributes to the memory problems in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Additionally, avocados are a rich source folate, which is vital for neuronal signalling, and vitamin E, an antioxidant, which can help protect neurons from damaging free radicals.</p>
<h2>Oily fish</h2>
<p>Fish such as sardines, salmon, mackerel and trout are excellent sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFAs, specifically omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are especially important in our brains as they are major building blocks of the cell membrane that surrounds neurons. Increasing intake of omega-3 fatty acids helps neurons to function properly. As a result, diets high in omega-3s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216930">may slow</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523795">cognitive decline</a> and could decrease the incidence of dementia.</p>
<h2>Green Tea</h2>
<p>Many people wake up in the morning and drink a cup of coffee or tea, which contains the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28990513">cognitive stimulant</a> caffeine. But green tea is also high in the amino acid L-theanine, which is important for producing the neurotransmitter <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224499000448">GABA.</a> Increasing GABA in the brain can promote <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28056735">mental clarity and relaxation</a>.</p>
<p>Matcha green tea is rich in L-theanine. Although matcha tea is high in caffeine, the abundance of L-theanine interacts with caffeine to avoid the “jitters” associated with excessive coffee.</p>
<p>Green tea is also high in antioxidants that have been linked to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15350981">lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases including</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040558">Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p>
<h2>Turmeric</h2>
<p>Turmeric is the curry spice that gives Indian foods their bright yellow colour. Turmeric contains curcumin, an anti-inflammatory noted for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27533649">treating arthritis</a>.  Curcumin can also exert anti-inflammatory actions in the brain and may be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29332042">protective against Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p>
<p>Laboratory mice that eat diets supplemented with curcumin have <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031211">increased numbers of neurons</a> (through a process called <em>neurogenesis</em>) in the hippocampus, the key area of the brain responsible for memory.</p>
<h2>Tasty takeaways…</h2>
<p>Neuroscience shows that regularly eating these foods could boost your brain power for a happier, healthier mind. I hope you might try mixing them into your regular meals. Or you can use these scientific findings as a great excuse for smoked salmon and avocado on toast for brunch!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/543834004/0/oupblogpsychology/">Can electrical stimulation of the brain enhance mind?</a></h4>

<p>It is almost philosophical to think that our mental representations, imagery, reasoning, and reflections are generated by electrical activity of interconnected brain cells. And even more so is to think that these abstract phenomena of the mind could be enhanced by passing electricity through specific cellular networks in the brain.</p>
<p>Yet, it turns out these tenets can be subjected to empirical experimentation. Groundbreaking discoveries made by Dr. Wilder Penfield with his patients undergoing open-brain surgeries to treat epilepsy opened a new field of brain research exploring physiological substrates of human memory. By applying electrical current in discrete regions of the brain’s cortex, Penfield induced a conscious experience of facts and events from the recent and distant past. For instance, one of his patients described re-living a childhood episode of a circus show with the vividness of detail associated with such a unique and captivating event. This <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/86/4/595/321416?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="noopener" target="_blank">phenomenal effect of electrical stimulation</a> on memory experience was described in a series of patients stimulated in different brain regions.</p>
<p>In summary, the effect was found in defined areas of the cortex when electrical current was applied with optimal frequency and amplitude parameters for inducing the memory experiences. This led Penfield and colleagues to hypothesize that the stimulation worked by activating some specific physiological substrates storing memory traces of the remembered events. The idea is brilliantly simple. Stimulating networks of brain cells at a set of parameters, which match their physiological activity when memories are encoded, can reverberate a memory trace and result in its conscious experience. Waves of the applied electrical current would in a way entrain and re-activate groups of connected cells supporting specific mental representations. Around the time of these experiments, Polish neurophysiologist Dr. Jerzy Konorski and Canadian neuropsychologist Dr. Donald Hebb independently proposed a mechanism through which such connected groups of cells, aka neuronal assemblies, could form <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.com/books/about/Integrative_activity_of_the_brain.html?id=atMdAAAAMAAJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the physiological substrate for our mental constructs</a> and their memory traces.</p>
<p>Since these initial ideas and findings, technological progress has been made to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416306820" rel="noopener" target="_blank">modulate these hypothetical substrates in attempt to enhance human memory performance</a>. Several studies of individual cases or small groups of patients reported both positive and negative effects of electrical stimulation in a range of brain regions. The positive effect was manifested in improved reaction time or response accuracy in various tests probing spatial, semantic, and other forms of declarative memory for facts and events. Despite the mixed effects and other limitations in these pioneering studies, improving mental processes supporting memory performance with electrical stimulation became a tangible reality.</p>

</blockquote></div>
<p>This fascinating research can now be more robust and reproducible in the era of collaborative brain research projects. In our recent study, we used data collected from 22 patients stimulated in a range of brain regions during performance of a verbal memory task completed at multiple clinical centers. Four brain regions, which were previously implicated in declarative memory functions, were investigated for the effect of electrical stimulation on remembering lists of common words like “fish” or “rose.” We found that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awx373/4793032" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more words were remembered when one of the studied regions was stimulated</a> (overlapping with the cortical area originally identified by Penfield). Electrical current passed through that region enabled the patients to recall more words as their abstract mental representation (or concepts, if you like) were generated. This time it was not the reaction time or response accuracy that was improved, but the memory for additional concepts of words when electrically entraining that brain region. And so was the subjective experience of one of the patients who reported that it was “easier to picture those words” in his mind.</p>
<p>Although this is still far from addressing the Konorski and Hebb models, we also observed <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.eneuro.org/content/early/2018/01/24/ENEURO.0369-17.2018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a parallel effect of the stimulation on brain oscillations in the “high gamma” frequencies</a>—a proposed indicator of neuronal assembly activity. We know that this activity is physiologically induced in response to word presentation for memory encoding. Electrical stimulation in the reported brain region enhanced the high gamma response, specifically on trials with words that ended up being forgotten (i.e. the poor encoding trials). This modulation of the gamma response reflected the behavioral change in memory performance—increased response was observed with memory enhancement, whereas the decreased response with a worsened performance. Thus, a concrete physiological process was linked to the effect on remembering mental concepts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, bridging the gap between the human mind and brain may not be as philosophical of a task after all. There are now at our disposal robust paradigms, effective tools, and tangible brain targets to reach out to the realm of declarative memory and cognition. The promise of physical devices to treat the abstract is very real.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/blog/from-postdocs-to-principal-investigators/">From Postdocs to Principal Investigators</a></h4>

<p><em>By Corey Moran</em></p>
<p>Armed with nothing but an Expo marker, white board, and quick wits, Postdoctoral candidates wishing to effloresce into full-fledged scientists, have only 20 minutes in front of a panel of distinguished faculty to showcase their scientific acumen and outline an entire career’s worth of research goals. Infamously known by the colloquial name “Chalk Talk”, this informal yet demanding presentation requires the distillation of complex scientific research, effective and engaging communication, as well approachability and flexibility; all without the convenience or assistance of technology. What may seem like a daunting task is actually a very typical and crucial aspect of the interviewing process for aspiring scientists. Mastery over this 20 minute scientific gauntlet becomes a pivotal step in the career path of a Postdoc, progressing from novice trainee to adept scientist.</p>
<p>The jump from Postdoctoral Research Fellow to a tenured professorship, is a notoriously arduous transition. Due to an abundance of post Ph.D. trainees (Postdocs), dwindling university tenure availability and the current, competitive academic climate, this transition is certainly one of the most formidable obstacles facing those that aspire to one day become a Principal Investigator (PI). Despite the difficulty, determined researchers stave off discouragement to pursue the exceptional opportunity to one day lead their own lab and conduct their own research.</p>
<p>To achieve this monumental goal, Postdocs must first complete a rigorous interviewing process consisting of: a formal, typically hour long, well-attended lecture centered around their research projects, rife with data, charts and scientific figures; the informal and intimate “Chalk Talk” given to a small panel of research faculty; as well as personal interviews with several scientists in the department. Developing the skills necessary to command each of the three unique interview types, is essential in order to quickly become a standout candidate. Training and conferring those critical skills to its Postdocs, MPFI’s recently formed Postdoctoral Association, is helping them conquer and excel in all facets of the interview process.</p>
<p>Assisting Postdocs in attaining their career goals is something that Dr. Paul Evans, Post-Doctoral Fellow and President of the MPFI Postdoc Association, considers to be a critically important role of the organization. He comments that since its inception, “The association has developed unique programs that are in place to foster a community among MPFI Postdocs and help acquire professional development skills that will prepare them for the next steps in a career in science.” Vital Initiatives like practice “Chalk Talks”, monthly journal clubs, and scientific presentation/ writing workshops are extremely advantageous opportunities for Postdocs to gain familiarity and practice with interviewing. Two talented, former Postdocs at MPFI noted in particular, that active participation in the Postdoc association enabled them to become successful in the interview process.</p>

<p>Drs. Won Chan Oh and Gordon Smith have recently traversed the transition between trainee and independent scientist, joining the faculty of distinguished universities and paving the way for future MPFI Postdocs. Dr. Oh, a former Postdoc in the Kwon Lab, joined the University of Colorado Denver, Department of Neuroscience as an assistant professor. In his new lab, Oh will build upon his previous work at MPFI in the Kwon lab, studying the role of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in developing neuronal circuitry using highly advanced imaging. Dr. Smith, a former Postdoc in the Fitzpatrick Lab, is now an assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota. Like Dr. Oh, Dr. Smith will incorporate the cutting-edge imaging techniques he learned and refined at MPFI to take a deeper look into the functional networks of the visual system in order to better elucidate how the brain processes vision.</p>
<p>Actualizing their dreams of becoming PIs, Drs. Oh and Smith demonstrate that though difficult, even the dreaded “Chalk Talk” portion of the scientific interview is unmistakably conquerable with the right amount of practice, preparation and dedication. MPFI’s Postdoc Association is doing just that, helping to facilitate the future success of its members.</p>

<h4>Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience showcased the science of songbird singing complimented by classical compositions inspired by the sonorous songsters.</h4>
<p>Early evening on Wednesday, April 18, science and song took flight in Benjamin Hall, as members of the local community, brimming with excitement, gathered for a night of virtuosic music and scientific discovery. Closing out the fifth season of Science Meets Music, the Max Planck Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) prepared a uniquely themed program centered around the beautiful and resonant melodies sung by birds.</p>
<p>Providing the scientific portion of the evening, was special guest lecturer Dr. Manfred Gahr, Ph.D., Director of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, and expert in all things songbird. Dr. Gahr’s lecture titled “Seasonal Singing of Birds: From Gonads to the Brain” provided an interesting insight as to why singing is unique to male songbirds and why patterns of singing vary, depending on the current season. Additionally, Dr. Gahr touched on the mechanisms involved in the development of song producing neural circuits as well as areas of the brain in songbirds that are critical for learning different patterns of sound.</p>
<p>Perfectly accompanying Dr. Gahr’s captivating lecture, were superlative performances by musical guest, the Palm Beach Symphony Chamber Ensemble. In their bookending recitals, the masterful string quartet played movements from the well-known Vivaldi concerto “Spring”, part of the larger work “The Four Seasons” as well as Haydn’s String Quartet in D major, Op. 64, No. 5 appropriately nicknamed “Lark.” Palm Beach Symphony principal cello, Claudio Jaffé provided enlightening commentary about the composers and their music before each piece. Guests in attendance were awed by the quartet’s musicianship, precision and uncanny ability to mimic the light, airy and vibrant nature of a songbird.</p>
<p>Introducing the chamber ensemble, Executive Director of the Palm Beach Symphony, David McClymont, spoke of the commonalities between MPFI’s and Palm Beach Symphony’s mission statements, commenting that “A big part of Palm Beach Symphony’s mission is to educate, entertain and engage. We feel that tonight is a perfect opportunity to combine all three of those pillars, collaborating with such a brilliant community partner as Max Planck Florida, who holds very similar ideals to ours.”</p>
<p>Though the curtain has been drawn on the current season of Science Meets Music, music enthusiasts and science seekers fret not. Due to overwhelmingly popular demand, Science Meets Music will return in 2019 for its sixth season. Be sure to keep a look out this coming fall, as more information will be released detailing event scheduling as well as the 2019 speaker and musical performance lineup.</p>

<p>For a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in <i>Applied Cognitive Psychology</i> researchers led by Aloysius Wei Lun Koh set out to test their theory that teaching improves the teacher’s learning because it compels the teacher to retrieve what they’ve previously studied. In other words, they believe the learning benefit of teaching is simply another manifestation of the well-known “testing effect” – the way that bringing to mind what we’ve previously studied leads to deeper and longer-lasting acquisition of that information than more time spent passively re-studying.</p>
<p><span id="more-33821"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 124 students and asked them spend ten minutes studying a text, with accompanying figures, about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">Doppler Effect</a> and soundwaves – a topic about which none of them had any previous knowledge – with a view to teaching the material themselves afterwards without notes. Participants were told they could take notes while studying but not keep them for the next stage.</p>
<p>After the study phase, the participants were divided into four groups. In one group participants spent five minutes being filmed alone while they stood and delivered a lesson on the study material without notes (they could use a blank flip chart to draw figures if they wanted). The other groups either spent the same time completing multiplication arithmetic; standing up and teaching verbatim from a set script (including making reference to pre-drawn figures on a white board); or writing down all they could remember from the text (i.e. a form of retrieval practice designed to induce the testing effect).</p>
<p>A week later, all the participants returned to the lab for a surprise test of their knowledge and comprehension of the original study text in the form of six free-response questions that required them to explain key concepts from the study materials.</p>
<p>The critical finding is that the teaching-without-notes group outperformed the group that had spent the same time completing arithmetic problems and the group that had taught from a script, but so too did the group who simply spent the same time retrieving what they’d learned. In fact, the final comprehension performance of the teaching-without-notes group and the retrieval-practice group was comparable.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results suggest that “the benefits of the learning-by-teaching strategy are attributable to retrieval practice; that is, the robust learning-by-teaching strategy works but only when the teaching involves <i>retrieving</i> the taught materials.”</p>
<p>The new findings don’t undermine the notion of teaching as an effect learning method, but they have practical implications for how the learning-by-teaching approach is applied in education and training. “In order to insure that students and tutors learn and retain the educational material that they have prepared and presented in class, they ought to internalize the to-be-presented material prior to communicating it to an audience, rather than rely on study notes during the presentation process”, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Critical readers may take issue with the lack of realism in the study – there was no audience of learners in either of the teaching conditions and therefore no interaction, which surely also plays a part in the learning benefits of teaching. Also, participants in all groups were originally primed to expect to have to teach the material, which may have had learning benefits in itself – perhaps the retrieval group would not have matched the comprehension of the teaching-without-notes group without being primed in this way.</p>
<p>Lun Koh and colleagues acknowledged some of these issues and they called on further research to “assess the importance of retrieval practice across a variety of teaching scenarios and activities.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/543265752/0/oupblogpsychology/">Creativity, the brain, and society</a></h4>

<p>Creativity research has come of age. Today, the nature of the creative process is investigated with every tool of modern cognitive neuroscience: neuroimaging, genetics, computational modeling, among them. Yet the brain mechanisms of creativity remain a mystery and the studies of the brains of “creative” individuals have so far failed to produce conclusive results.</p>
<p>But the mystery is gradually yielding ground. As we are reconceptualizing creativity as a complex, and arguably derivative construct consisting of many moving parts, we are beginning to study these moving parts in a systematic way. The old tabloid clichés linking creativity to specific brain structures are no longer tenable, but they do seem to have captured some important aspects of the underlying neurobiological processes. We no longer believe that creativity “resides” in the right hemisphere, but evidence is growing that the right hemisphere is particularly adept at dealing with novelty, an important ingredient of any creative process. In contrast, the left hemisphere appears to be the repository of well-entrenched knowledge and skills, verbal and non-verbal alike, which is an equally important prerequisite of a creative process (remember the giants on whose shoulders we all stand).</p>
<p>This is a radical departure from the old notion linking the left hemisphere to language and right hemisphere to non-verbal visuo-spatial processes, and it elucidates the complementary roles of the two cerebral hemispheres in the creative process. Furthermore, the complementary roles of the two hemispheres in supporting novelty vs well-routinized cognitive skills appears to be present across a wide range of species, not just primates, but other mammalians. They are present even in species whose brains are devoid of developed cortex and rely instead on the phylogenetically ancient principle consisting of relatively “modular” nuclei, such as birds (and by extension probably in dinosaurs). Such evolutionary continuities open the door for the studies of the evolutionary precursors for forebears of human creativity. Likewise, it is no longer tenable to view the frontal lobes as the “seat” of creativity, but evidence is growing in linking the frontal lobes to processing cognitive novelty. The frontal lobes, or, more precisely, the prefrontal cortex, is also critical for salience judgment, the ability to decide what is important and what is not. This ability is essential for the creative process, lest the creative mind strays into innovative but inconsequential esoterica.</p>

<p>But understanding the workings of the mind behind the innovation is only part of the challenge facing creativity research. In a society infused with innovation at an increasingly accelerating rate, understanding its impact on the consumer becomes particularly important. In the not-so-distant past, a human being could acquire a repertoire of knowledge and skills in one’s youth and coast on that knowledge for the rest of one’s life. This was true even for professionals engaged in seemingly daunting intellectual activities. In reality, however, a physician or an engineer could operate throughout much of their professional career on a “mental autopilot,” without much need to update their professional knowledge or skills. This was even more the case for a person’s ability to navigate daily life.</p>
<p>But today new technologies and knowledge saturate society at such a rate<del>,</del> that even the laziest and least intellectually inclined among us are forced to absorb innovation all the time, whether we like it or not, both in our professional activities and in everyday life. The ever-accelerating rate of innovation places unprecedented demands on its consumer and makes the consumer a real partner in the process to a degree unprecedented in the history of our species. When you see an octogenarian using an iPhone or an iPad, you can safely assume that she did not grow up with either of these hi-tech devices, that nothing in her early background prepared her for the flood of new electronic technologies, yet here she is, operating them confidently and competently. How does the human brain function in this new environment? How does it develop and how does it age? How do these radical changes in the degree of novelty exposure change the nature of psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as dementia?</p>
<p>Finally, in our increasingly technological world, the question of Artificially Intelligent (AI) creativity inevitably arises. Offensive as this may sound to the more exceptionalism-mined members of our own species, if creativity is defined as a conjunction of novelty and societal relevance, then the authorship of the creative process should not be part of its definition. Until now, AI has focused on the design of dedicated devices each adept at performing a pre-specified, relatively narrow class of task. But more recently the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) movement is gathering speed with an audacious goal of designing artificial devices capable of open-ended learning and yes, creative processes. Today, AI-generated art, both paintings and music, has been judged by human connoisseurs as “creative.” How we, the biological humans, will fit into this brave new world and how we’ll be changed by it, is yet another question for future creativity research.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>In research published in the 1990s, psychologists asked people to list their biggest regrets in life and found that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-05382-001">they tended to mention things they hadn’t done, rather than things they had</a>.  Now, one of the psychologists behind that seminal research – Thomas Gilovich at Cornell University – together with his colleague Shai Davidai at The New School for Social Research – have looked into the content of people’s regrets, as opposed to how they were brought about (by action or inaction). Across six studies, the pair present new evidence, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-21180-001">published in <em>Emotion</em></a>, that our most enduring regrets concern not living up to our ideal selves (i.e. not becoming the person we wanted to be), as opposed to not living according to our “ought selves” (the person we should have been based on our duties and responsibilities).</p>
<p><span id="more-33818"></span></p>
<p>The researchers surveyed hundreds of participants, including students, but mostly members of the public recruited on Amazon’s survey website. For most of the studies, the researchers started out telling their recruits the difference between regrets concerning the “ideal self” (not achieving goals they had set for themselves, their dreams and ambitions) and “the ought self” (not meeting the norms and rules they had for themselves or fulfilling their obligations to others), before asking them to list, name and categorise their regrets.</p>
<p>Across the different studies, the participants said they experienced regrets concerning their ideal self more often (72 per cent vs. 28 per cent); they mentioned more ideal-self regrets than ought-self regrets when asked to list their regrets in life so far (57 per cent vs. 43 per cent); and when asked to name their single biggest regret in life, participants were more likely to mention a regret about not fulfilling their ideal self (76 per cent vs. 24 per cent mentioning an ought-self regret).</p>
<p>Gilovich and Davidai next tested their belief that a key reason why ideal-self regrets are more enduring is that we are less likely to take practical and psychological action at the time to repair these regrets, compared with ought-self regrets.</p>
<p>For instance, presented with hypothetical ideal-self regrets (such as forsaken dreams or romantic interests not pursued) and hypothetical ought-self regrets (like failing to visit a dying relative or infidelity), participants said a typical person was more likely to take action, psychological and practical, to repair the ought-self regrets, such as by finding a silver lining or doing something to dampen the regret, than to repair ideal-self regrets.</p>
<p>In a follow-up study, participants described actual regrets they had, either ideal-self related or ought-self related, and said what they’d done to cope with them. Those asked to describe ought-self regrets rated them as having been more urgent and said they’d taken more steps to cope, including changing their behaviour, rectifying the situation or undoing it entirely.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers switched things up and asked 157 more participants to recall a resolved regret or an unresolved regret (“unfinished business”) – they found those asked to write about the former were more likely to describe an ought-self regret, while those asked to write about the latter were more likely to describe an ideal-self regret.</p>
<p>Gilovich and Davidai and are not saying that the only reason that ideal-self regrets are more enduring is because we are less likely to attend to them and resolve them, but they think this is a key factor in why they are generally more bothersome and come more readily to mind. Other possible reasons (not tested in the current research) are that our ideal selves are simply less obtainable than our ought selves, more abstract, and less context dependent, meaning regrets pertaining to them are triggered more often.</p>
<p>“Our work is the first to show that people’s most prominent life regrets more often involve failures to live up to their ideal self than their ought self,” the researchers concluded. And they added the work “… is the first to document the role played by behavioural and psychological coping mechanisms in people’s tendency to regret their failures to live up to their ideal selves.”</p>
<p>The new results are backed up by anecdotal accounts from patients nearing the end of their lives, described <a href="https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/">in a book</a> by palliative nurse Bronnie Ware in 2013: “When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled,” she wrote. “Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices that they had made, or not made.”</p>
<p>Can we take any practical insights from the latest findings? Gilovich and Davidai urge caution, suggesting that the most advisable way to live will depend on how much weight you place on your ought self vs. your ideal self.</p>
<p>If you place a premium on your ought self, you “would be wise to minimise [your] regrets by thinking twice before forging ahead [and seizing the moment]” they suggest. On the other hand, “if one is an adventurous soul guided by her ideal self, she might indeed end up happier by seizing the day and not looking back. As we have shown in this research, a person focused on her ideal self is more likely to lose sleep over her ‘wouldas’ and ‘couldas’ than her ‘shouldas’.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>You’re at a ten-pin bowling alley with some friends, you bowl your first ball – and it’s a strike. Do you instantly grin with delight? Not according to a<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930302288"> study of bowlers</a>, who smiled not at a moment of triumph but rather when they pivoted in their lanes, to look at their fellow bowlers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That study provided the earliest evidence for a controversial hypothesis, the Behavioural Ecology View (BECV) of facial displays, outlined in detail in a new <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/references/S1364-6613(18)30029-9">opinion piece</a> in <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i>. Carlos Crivelli at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK and Alan Fridlund at the University of California, Santa Barbara, put forward the case that facial displays are not universal, “pre-wired” expressions of emotion – a concept supported by 80 per cent of emotion researchers in a recent poll – but are flexible tools for influencing the behaviour of other people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-33793"></span></p>
<p>The same range of specific facial displays have been associated with anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise in many different cultures. As Paul Ekman at the University of California, San Francisco – the best-known proponent of the “basic emotions theory” or BET – writes in a <a href="https://www.paulekman.com/uncategorized/darwins-claim-universals-facial-expression-challenged/">blog post:</a> “The capacity for humans in radically different cultures to label facial expressions with terms from a list of emotion terms has replicated nearly 200 hundred times.”</p>
<p>However, Crivelli and Fridlund write in their paper: “Despite its popularity, the assumptions and prescriptions of BET are meeting unprecedented challenges.” They argue that there are “serious methodological problems” in the initial studies on indigenous societies, and point to “countervailing” data from more recent studies, also conducted on small-scale indigenous societies, one Melanesian (the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea) and two African (the Himba of Namibia and the Mwani of Mozambique).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Data gathered in the past five years from these societies are “inconsistent with the universality thesis”, the pair write. For instance, when Trobrianders are presented with the “gasping face”, which is usually taken as expressing fear, they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791137?dopt=Abstract">perceive it as a “threatening” face</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to the BET, this is an example of an unusual local cultural influence. But Crivelli and Fridlund aren’t convinced. They point to data showing that the gasping face is used as a threat display also in several African, Amazonian and Pacific small-scale indigenous societies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Mismatches on the original face studies were always attributed to thin, cultural rule-governed overlays,” they write. But, they argue “Those deviations, just like the new evidence found in African and Melanesian populations may indicate <i>fundamental</i> [my italics] human diversity.”</p>
<p>It’s true that people from many different countries associate smiles with happiness (the Trobrianders are, in fact, a notable exception), but this has more to do with convergent genetic and cultural evolution, Crivelli and Fridlund argue, than to do with smiles being some kind of involuntary, hard-wired read-out of positive emotion.</p>
<p>How does what we know about babies’ facial displays and emotions feed into this debate? Babies often smile when they see a family member or pet. They wrinkle their nose and protrude their tongue when given food they don’t like. Their eyes open wide at loud noises. And their mouths turn down when they cry. But according to BECV, this doesn’t necessarily mean that these are expressions of the emotions of happiness, disgust, fear or sadness.</p>
<p>For the BECV, which holds that these displays have not evolved to provide a fixed read-out of internal states but rather to influence the behaviour of other people, common facial displays are seen as having the following communicative functions – in adults, as well (the more traditional BET interpretation of the corresponding felt emotion is in brackets):<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Smile – (Happiness) – Influence interactant to play or affiliate</li>
<li>Pouting – (Sadness) – Recruit interactant’s succour or protection</li>
<li>Scowling – (Anger) – Influence interactant to submit</li>
<li>Gasping – (Fear) – Deflect interactant’s attack via one’s own submission or incipient retreat</li>
<li>Nose scrunching – (Disgust) – Reject current interaction trajectory</li>
<li>Neutral – (“Suppressed emotion” or no emotion) – Lead the interactant nowhere in interaction trajectory</li>
</ul>
<p>It may well be that when we’re in a positive mood state, we’re more open to interacting and affiliating with others – and more likely to smile. But we all sometimes – or even often – smile when we’re not <i>feeling</i> happy. According to the BET, these are insincere smiles. But if the purpose of a smile is to encourage other people to interact and affiliate (when meeting new people for the first time, say, or walking into an important meeting), they aren’t insincere at all.</p>
<p>In their paper, Fridlund and Crivelli also point to a re-conceiving of animal facial (and postural) displays as an “ecology of signalling”, based on the interests of the displayers and the receivers, who all have their own histories of interaction and who must negotiate for advantages within their group and their environment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There is some research (such as the bowling study) that finds we are more likely to use facial displays – or that the displays are more pronounced – when we’re with other people. But one criticism of the BECV approach is that we do smile, grimace and frown when we are alone. Crivelli and Fridlund argue that while we may be alone physically we are never “psychologically alone”. “Our cast of interactants may include fantasised humans, real non-humans, humans who are not proximal, or any nearby objects”, they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But this won’t be the BECV argument that doubters will find hardest to accept. BECV will always be a tough sell, Crivelli and Fridlund note, in part because it’s more demanding to investigate experimentally than BET, and also, they argue, because “BECV requires shaking off a romanticised view of human nature…that makes the face a battleground between an interior ‘authentic self’ and an external, impression-managed ‘social self’…Within BECV both ‘selves’ are illusory. We are unified organisms, and like our words, voices and gestures, our facial displays are part of our plans of action in social commerce.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But it isn’t only the BET itself that BECV challenges. What about the body of work on the role of facial displays in triggering emotion contagion? Or in empathy, for that matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The BECV is fascinating</span>. But to call it “controversial” is probably an understatement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<img alt="Mindfulness Mediation" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Mindfullness-Meditation-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is fair to say that mindfulness meditation has become a mainstream technique in the toolkit of psychologists and others working in various settings across the world. It has made its way from clinical environments, such as the hospital or therapy room, to our schools, our workplaces and our universities. But what evidence is there for its usefulness in these different contexts?</p>
<p>Moving away from clinical environments has meant moving away from a reliance on clinical effects to justify the implementation of mindfulness meditation interventions. Now, mindfulness meditation is not only linked to decreased stress and relapse of mood disorders, it is also claimed that mindfulness meditation results in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2012.748889">better relationships</a>, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/523f28fce4b0f99c83f055f2/t/52d92a65e4b04d4af95709ed/1389963877991/VanDoesumVanLangeJPSP2013.pdf">more prosocial behaviour</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-34922-001">higher job satisfaction</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273581000173X">more focused attention, greater memory skills</a> and <a href="http://prsinstitute.org/downloads/related/spiritual-sciences/meditation/TowardtheIntegrationofMeditationintoHigherEducation.pdf">improved critical thinking</a>.</p>
<p>But, how strong is the evidence for these claims? Take the research on relationships and pro-social behaviour – <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20299-z">a recent meta-analysis</a> demonstrated that evidence for these benefits falls away when studies use stronger methods.</p>
<h3><strong>Mindfulness meditation and cognition</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the other claims regarding the benefits of mindfulness meditation relate to cognitive ability. These claims can be divided into those pertaining to lower-order cognitive functions, such as perception, attention and automatic responses (as Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman would say, thinking fast), and higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving, decision-making and, in general, critical thinking (or thinking slow).</p>
<blockquote><p>Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically.</p></blockquote>
<p>We were particularly interested in the claims that mindfulness may benefit critical thinking for two reasons. One, critical thinking is a hugely important set of skills to cultivate in society so it is important that we understand whether interventions aimed at improving critical thinking work.</p>
<p>Second, there is a potential paradox within the claim that mindfulness may facilitate critical thinking. Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically. Critical thinking fundamentally requires <strong><em>not </em></strong>accepting information without questioning it. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02043/full">a cross-sectional study</a> we conducted showed both positive and negative effects of the tendency to be mindful on performance in a critical thinking task.</p>
<p>We followed this up with a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-017-0789-8">lab-based experiment</a> on the effects of a single guided mindfulness meditation in comparison to a guided sham meditation – something that sounded like mindfulness meditation but without the specific instructions on how to control your attention. In this experiment, there was no overall benefit of being randomised to the mindfulness meditation group. However, those in the mindfulness meditation group who were less disposed towards putting effort into critical thinking and those who were less open-minded did experience some improvement in critical thinking performance.</p>
<h3><strong>Testing effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on cognition</strong></h3>

Across 6 weeks, we tested t<img alt="College student" class="size-medium wp-image-10118 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/College-student-300x200.jpg" width="300" />he effects of regular mindfulness meditation against the effects of engaging in a sham meditation – listening to a recording which was ostensibly a guided mindfulness meditation – among a sample of university students. We focused on students not just out of convenience but also because a report on the integration of meditation practices in to higher education had suggested doing so would improve critical thinking among students.</p>
<p>Ninety students were randomly assigned to either the mindfulness meditation group or the sham meditation group. Importantly, neither the students nor the researchers were aware of which group the participants were in, and the participants were under the impression that both conditions involved equally effective meditation techniques.<span style="color: #000000;"> In other words, the study was a randomised controlled trial with a double blind methodology which was also </span><a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0122-7">pre-registered</a>.</p>
<p>We were able to achieve this rigour by partnering with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>, a company which produces the world’s most popular mindfulness mediation app. This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate. We even got Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of Headspace, to record our sham meditation script.</p>
<blockquote><p>This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The outcome measures of primary interest in this study were mindfulness, executive functioning, critical thinking and two dispositions towards critical thinking – actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition. According to theories in cognitive psychology which focus on fast and slow thinking, known as <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dual-process-theory-Evans_Stanovich_PoPS13.pdf">dual process theories</a>, executive function is the mechanism through which responses generated through fast thinking are inhibited which allows slow thinking, such as critical thinking, to occur.</p>
<p>Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking. We found that both mindfulness meditation and sham meditation resulted in equal improvements in critical thinking over the course of the stud<span style="color: #000000;">y. Therefore, there was no effect specific to the practice of mindfulness meditation. We believe that there are a number of possible explanations for this finding.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is likely that the improvement in both groups can be attributed to a mixture of demand characteristics (i.e. participants changing their responses in line with what they expect the study results to be) and a placebo effect. In relation to the mindfulness outcome measure, it is also possible that the mindfulness questionnaire we used is not sensitive enough to detect changes.</p>
<p>The psychometric properties of this and many other mindfulness questionnaires are questionable and it is probable that the best we can hope to measure with such questionnaires is “perceived mindfulness”. In general, there is a great need for improvement in the methodological quality of mindfulness research, particularly in terms of measurement and experimental control.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In summary, th</span>ere have been many unsupported and unchallenged claims regarding the supposed benefits of mindfulness practice, as it is taught in Western psychology, and a big industry has been built on the shaky foundation of these claims. We have demonstrated that it is possible to identify these claims and apply rigorous research methods to determine whether they are supported or not. Mindfulness research must continue to use randomized control trials, double blinding, and objective measurements of adherence and outcomes of the intervention for claims regarding mindfulness practice to be taken seriously.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Preprints are here!!! Starting today authors submitting their manuscript to most PLOS journals* can also choose to post their article on bioRxiv, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s preprint server for the life sciences. This is an important development for both PLOS, for bioRxiv, for the authors we serve, and for the life sciences. For PLOS, it enables us to achieve a long-standing aspect of our vision to make research more quickly available to enable discovery and reuse.  For bioRxiv, this development will augment the server’s already rapidly climbing manuscript submission rate. And authors will gain the opportunity of sharing their work before peer review on a trusted platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Collaborating with bioRxiv is part of a much bigger strategy for PLOS moving forward, one in which we’ll renew our roots of being a catalytic open publisher” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “To accelerate innovation, we’ll often act in partnership with others in the community, which will move us closer to our vision of how scientific communication should work.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“We warmly welcome the further integration of PLOS journals with bioRxiv,” said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv. “The server’s goal is the acceleration of research and providing unrestricted access to manuscripts before they enter an often lengthy process of peer review is one of several ways bioRxiv is delivering on its promise.”</em></p>
<p><strong>So what are preprints exactly?</strong></p>
<p>A preprint is an openly available scientific manuscript that an author uploads to a public server like bioRxiv prior to peer review. The preprint contains data and methodologies and is typically the same manuscript that is submitted to a journal.</p>
<p><b>Why are preprints important?</b></p>
<p>Well, for starters, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">early sharing</a> of ideas can lead to new discoveries and collaboration, and early feedback can help improve your manuscript. We are committed to putting your science first. By allowing a submission to be posted on bioRxiv, authors accelerate the dissemination of their work and invite commentary by a broader community, which PLOS editors may evaluate as part of peer review.</p>
<p><strong>How will it work?</strong> This graphic is a visual representation:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8201" height="652" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png" width="1098" /></a></p>
<p>In short, PLOS will perform initial manuscript screening compatible with bioRxiv standards, covering appropriate scope and article type, plagiarism detection, and other basic ethical and technical criteria. Articles will then post to the bioRxiv server and be freely accessible online. Authors must choose to opt-in to this preprint process when they submit papers to PLOS.</p>
<p>When sharing this post on Facebook or Twitter please use the hashtag #powertothepreprint to help increase visibility and awareness for preprints. Publish with PLOS and post your preprint on bioRxiv and let’s keep science open, and accessible, together.</p>
<p>*<em>PLOS Medicine </em>continues to permit authors to post preprints of their research, but given particular <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002563">issues</a> related to research in human health, will not initially be offering transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv.  <em>PLOS Biology</em> also continues to encourage authors to post preprints and will enable this automated preprint posting service to submitting authors in a few months.</p>

<h4>And the hunt for its neural causes</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8atjnMgv1YE7waQcX5HYaA.jpeg" />Neural detectives. Credit: Pixabay/www_sion_pics</figure><p>It all started with ketamine. To some, vets mainly, it’s a horse tranquilliser. To others, a party drug. To those with severe clinical depression, a potential, literal, life-saver. A dose of ketamine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/03/depression-medication-fda-psychadelics-ketamine-psilocybin-johnson-and-johnson-mdma">can rapidly dull</a> the symptoms of depression, providing immediate relief for those crippled by the darkest thoughts. And while ketamine does not work for everyone, it seems to work in many people who are untouched by standard anti-depressant drugs.</p><p>Ketamine could then be our best lead in the hunt for depression. For if we search for where ketamine affects the brain, and for how it affects the brain, we will get vital clues to the cause of depression. And so to a long-lasting effective treatment. Two studies just published in <em>Nature </em>used precisely this trick, and spectacularly uncovered not just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25509">compelling evidence</a> of the tiny brain region to target, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25752">exactly what goes wrong</a> in it to create depression — that some neurons are, literally, depressed.</p><p>The hunt for depression is a tricky case for any neural detective. Your brain has 86 billion neurons. Where to start looking for suspects? Well, let’s think about that for a second. We want somewhere in the brain that can control how you feel things are going — that things are sometimes better than expected, and worth enjoying. And somewhere in the brain that has something to do with serotonin, because the long-standing treatment for clinical depression are “SSRIs”, drugs that make more serotonin available by stopping it from being mopped up.</p><p>Enter the lateral habenula. Rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it? But it fits the suspect’s profile. It connects to both serotonin and dopamine releasing neurons. When dopamine neurons burst with activity, that’s a signal we just got something better than expected (serotonin neurons might <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/06346">signal a similar thing</a>). And when the lateral habenula releases a burst of activity, it stops the dopamine and serotonin neurons from bursting. Stops them from telling the brain — hey, that was unexpected.</p><p>Now, usually, this is for the common good. The lateral habenula sends the signal that what just happened was, in fact, expected. So you, little dopamine neuron, and you, precious serotonin neuron, do not need to burst — everything is as it is should be. With this signal from the habenula, your brain knows the world is predictable, and can go about its business; if every little thing was signalled as being surprising, you’d spend all day giggling and kicking things to see what they did. You’d be a three year old.</p><p>But when we look in the brains of depressed mice, we see their lateral habenula is bursting more than usual. Much more. The “nothing surprising” signal is being sent far too much, and at the wrong time. The dopamine and serotonin neurons cannot frolic and play. The brain is robbed of some key signals that life is worth pursuing.</p><p>We suspect the lateral habenula based on this strong circumstantial evidence, that it connects to the right things and its signals go haywire in depressed mice. Now to get a conviction we need more than circumstantial evidence. We need probable cause: does ketamine stop the bursting and remove depression? And we need motive: what drives the habenula to increase its bursting?</p><p>The two studies in <em>Nature</em> from Hailan Hu and team answered both questions. Let’s start, as they did, with probable cause: if we stick ketamine into the habenula, does it alleviate depression? Yes. Depressed rats recover. In a bunch of tests, injecting ketamine into the habenula restores a rat’s élan: exploring, reacting, enjoying the taste of sweet sweet sucrose.</p><p>(And this is true in a type of depressed mouse too. No one believes for a second that rats or mice experience the range of difficult and terrible thoughts accompanying clinical depression in people. So finding a common effect across quite different species of rodent, each type replicating different aspects of the human disorder, is key to believing that all this work has something to do with depression.)</p><p>Right, so ketamine can work its magic from within the habenula. But we want evidence that it has any effect on the habenula itself. For, surely, if that over-active bursting of the habenula in some way causes depression then ketamine should clobber the bursts? Remarkably, it does. Ketamine reduces the number of bursting neurons, right down to the same number found in healthy brains. We now have a big wodge of evidence for a probable cause of depression: habenula neurons burst fire when they should not, and stopping this bursting with ketamine stops depression (in tiny rodents).</p><p>Even better, because we know how ketamine attaches itself to a neuron (to NMDA receptors, if you like such things), Hu’s team could work out which specific hole in the neuron’s skin was being opened to cause the bursting. Ketamine stopped the hole from opening. Which means we now have a specific target to build anti-depressant drugs for: to stop this hole, this channel, from opening too much.</p><p>Ah, but we can do even better than that. Hu and team then went after the motive, asking why the habenula neurons were bursting too much in the first place. Why is this channel open when it should not be?</p><p>The first clue was in an odd property of the neurons that burst in the habenula. When doing nothing at all, these neurons were more depressed than the others. Neurons at rest have a characteristic, tiny voltage, a voltage created by the difference between how many ions are in them and how many are outside them. The habenula’s bursting neurons had a lower voltage when resting than the others. And this lower voltage means the channel that makes bursts is primed, ready to open; when the voltage is higher, the channel is turned off. Guess what? In depressed rats, there are more depressed neurons in the habenlua. Ergo, there are too many neurons ready to burst without provocation, at the wrong time, and in the wrong place.<br /> <br />Almost there, we almost have the motive. What then caused there to be too many depressed neurons? Well, whatever controls the difference between ions inside and outside a neuron. And that turned out to be the other cells in the brain, the ones that aren’t neurons. The unsung below-stairs staff that tidy up the mess, fix the broken crockery, and keep the food and drink flowing. The glia.</p><p>Hu’s team found that wrapped around each habenula neuron is a special glia cell. That glia cell’s job is to clear potassium away from around the neuron. (Potassium being one of the key ions that makes neurons work properly — eat bananas, people.) In depressed mice, that glia cell was too good at its job. It mopped up way more potassium than it should (if you care about these things, it over-expressed the KIR4.1 channel. Happy now?). And what does less potassium outside the neuron mean? Yep: the neuron has a lower voltage at rest. The motive is clear: an overly-enthusiastic glia cell is sweeping away far more potassium than it should, making its neuron neighbour depressed, so depressed it bursts when it should not; and this bursting is, it seems, a cause of what we call depression.</p><p>Why is this knowledge even better? Ah, because now we can search for drugs to target the specific mechanism that goes wrong, in those specific types of glia cells, drugs that aim to rebalance potassium around those neurons. Indeed, Hu and team used genetic tricks to bodge or block the glia cell’s mechanism in their mice, and voila! Bursting returned to normal and the mice recovered their elan. And having such a specific drug target is fantastic, as the more precise the tool for the job, the easier it is to avoid unpleasant side effects.</p><p>Caveat emptor. Let’s list all the things that get in the way of this being the best thing since Pop Tarts. For a start, these are rats and mice. It is notoriously tricky to translate findings in rodents into something that works in humans. Very few drugs that work in rodents become successful drugs in humans. The endless failures of clinical trials for Alzheimer’s is proof enough of that. Another blip is that there is evidently a whole other story to play out, of how these glia go wrong in the first place — and how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/jan/08/is-everything-johann-hari-knows-about-depression-wrong-lost-connections">the well-documented roles</a> of stress, life-events, and predisposing genes all contribute. On top of that, ketamine does not work in all people; so this cannot be the cause of depression</p><p>But it seems unlikely that there is one single cause. And the fact ketamine works is hopeful. Hu and team have found wonderfully specific targets to test. If this does not turn out to be a major part of the solution to clinical depression, it gives many ideas of what could be the solution.</p><p>Very little of this work would have been possible without basic science, without science that is not driven by immediate goals of studying disease. Take for example the clues that the lateral habenula could be important. These come from people studying how the brain learns. There is a <a href="https://medium.com/s/theories-of-mind/did-i-do-that-636a7f2b0520">well developed theory</a> for how the firing of dopamine neurons controls learning. This theory prompted major efforts to understand: well, what controls the firing of dopamine neurons? And here was unearthed the lateral habenula, an obscure part of the brain of late, languishing unloved, now risen to prominence. And a few more examples of the contributions of basic science for good measure: the tests of the rats’ behaviour to work out how depressed they were; or how to record the bursting in neurons; or how to test the channel that causes the bursting. All these, and more, come from people driven by curiosity, not by being told to work on a specific disease.</p><p>For we can never know what will be key to unlocking the mystery of a brain disorder. But as Hu and team dramatically demonstrated, when we get a sniff of a clue, we can grab all our accumulated scientific know-how, tricks, and tools and use them to turn one small clue into a sprawling case for the prosecution. The game is afoot.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/542827554/0/oupblogpsychology/">Social media use and disturbed sleep</a></h4>

<p>Are you spending more and more time consuming social media through your computer, mobile phone, video games, and social media apps? If so, you’re not alone. Data from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a> has shown that use of social media among adults has grown from 5% in 2005 to 69% in 2018, with almost 90% of 18–29-years-olds indicating use. Using social media of various forms <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/10/19/peds.2016-2592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">may have some benefits</a>; in addition to entertainment value, social media can also expose us to new ideas and current events, promote community participation, facilitate connection with long-distance friends and family, and enhance access to social networks.</p>
<p>However, social media use can have negative health-related consequences as well. Using social media has been associated with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40675-015-0023-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">important sleep-related outcomes</a> such as a shorter number of hours slept at night and poorer sleep quality. This is noteworthy because the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/bedroompoll/NSF_Bedroom_Poll_Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Sleep Foundation</a> reports that almost half of Americans don’t get the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep on week nights. Because social media commonly involves interactive screen time, it may be more detrimental to sleep than more passive types of screen media, such as watching television. Among other mechanisms, social media use may also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945710001632?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impact sleep directly</a> by displacing sleep and indirectly by promoting emotional, cognitive, and/or physiological arousal. Therefore, our research group has focused on the impact of social media use in particular, rather than screen time more generally, given its relevance to sleep health.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743516000025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">We previously showed</a> that those who use social media more than two hours per day were about twice as likely to have disturbed sleep—including decreased sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep—compared to those who use social media 30 minutes per day or fewer. However, we had not yet examined the impact of the <em>time of day</em> of social media use. While social media use may impact sleep regardless of the time of day, it may be particularly important before bedtime for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>social media use may delay bedtime and displace time available for sleep;</li>
<li>mental activation can hinder ease of falling asleep;</li>
<li>the light from screen-based devices can delay the onset of sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/9/zsx113/3926043" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we recently undertook a study</a> to explore whether social media use in the 30 minutes just before bed was linked with poorer sleep, over and above social media use across the entire day.</p>
<p><strong>Who was involved in the study?</strong></p>
<p>We studied 1,763 young adults between the ages of 19–32 who completed a web-based survey. They were recruited by randomly dialing phone numbers (cell phones and land lines) and by sampling a selection of addresses. The sample assessed in the study represents the young adult population across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>How did we measure social media use and sleep disturbance?</strong></p>
<p>We measured social media use in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>To assess social media use over the entire day, we asked participants to report the typical total number of minutes per day they used social media for personal use.</li>
<li>To assess social media use before bed, we asked participants to answer the question: “How frequently over the past year did you check social media in the 30 minutes before falling asleep at night?”</li>
</ol>
<p>We assessed sleep disturbance using items on a web-based survey that assessed problems with sleep, difficulty falling asleep, whether sleep was refreshing, and sleep quality over the past seven days.</p>
<p><strong>What did we find?</strong></p>
<p>Compared to participants who rarely check social media before bed, those who most often check before bed were about 1.5 times more likely to have more disturbed sleep. This was still true even when we considered how much participants used social media across the entire day.</p>
<p><strong>What </strong><em><strong>doesn’t </strong></em><strong>this study tell us?</strong></p>
<p>Because we assessed social media use and sleep disturbance at the same time, this study can’t tell us whether social media use leads to disturbed sleep, or whether disturbed sleep contributes to social media use. Future studies will need to examine this over time to answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this study matter?</strong></p>
<p>If future work is able to determine that social media in the 30 minutes before bed use leads to disturbed sleep (rather than the other direction), this would suggest that young adults who want to improve their sleep should focus on reducing social media use at this particular time of day. Reducing social media use in the 30 minutes before bed may be more feasible and effective than reducing social media use across the entire day.</p>

<p>Celebrities are people famous for being famous. Have you ever given any thought to how it happens that pop-culture figures become so well-known, even when they have risen to the top upon a wave of interest for which there was not the slightest rational explanation? What is the real root cause of our lemming-like rush to keep tabs on insignificant but famous people? What leads us to share this information on social media? Why do we visit gossip portals and read tabloids, even though they’re totally worthless to us? Partial answers to these questions are given by a trio of researchers via a series of creative experiments that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-32098-001">they’ve reported</a> in <i>Psychology of Popular Media Culture.</i></p>
<p><span id="more-33800"></span></p>
<p>Most of us are afraid of being excluded or ignored. The ability to detect and avoid ostracism likely developed for evolutionary reasons – as humans, remaining in groups enhances our survival. Often, even when the experience of ostracism seems trivial or rationally beneficial, we experience negative consequences. Nicole Iannone at Radford University and her colleagues concluded that the feeling of being “out of the loop” on popular culture may produce similar psychological consequences as partial ostracism – especially less “need satisfaction” (that is, less satisfaction of the four fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control), reduced competence, and more negative moods.</p>
<p>The researchers asked American undergrad participants in a first experiment to view photographs of musicians who they were told are in the news at the moment and that most people in pilot research had recognised. In fact, some were chosen to be highly familiar (like Justin Bieber) and others less so (like Ellie Goulding).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Viewing musicians that were supposedly very famous, but whom the participants did not recognise, led them to report less need satisfaction and a slight increase in negative mood.</p>
<p>A second experiment confirmed these results using a larger sample of students and pictures of actors. In a third experiment the researchers went one step further, finding similar psychological effects for failing to recognise supposedly famous pop culture logos, even among those participants who said pop culture isn’t important. This is surprising considering that people who supposedly don’t care about popular culture should not feel bad when they are unfamiliar with it.</p>
<p>A final study replicated the previous results using a subtler method. The researchers simply asked students to indicate their pop culture preferences using Buzzfeed-style quizzes. Critically, some of the participants were quizzed about highly familiar celebrities and pop topics (movies, books, TV shows etc.) whereas others were quizzed about more obscure people and topics. A control group rated buildings. Even though there was no explicit mention of other people’s familiarity with the quiz items, those participants in the unfamiliar pop culture condition experienced an effect of being more out of the loop, including lower need satisfaction, and more negative mood (in contrast, those in the familiar pop culture condition did not experience a boost to need satisfaction compared with controls). These effects occurred regardless of participants’ beliefs about the importance of pop culture.</p>
<p>The results of these experiments suggest it is highly probable that our participation in pop culture is not due to its attractiveness, but rather the desire to avoid the negative emotions associated with the feeling of being out of the loop – at least among university-age people.</p>
<p>What is most striking is the fact that we do this even when declaring our indifference to pop culture. Our evolved sensitivity to ostracism protects us from social exclusion by directing our behaviours at a lemming-like rush towards shallow pop culture, which very few of us even care about. Perhaps the effects described here explain the shallowness of that culture. After all, it’s enough for us to be familiar with celebrity icons, to have heard about people famous for being famous. We can’t necessarily be bothered with what they have to offer us, and for sure, hearing about them won’t improve our mood.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/headphones-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Unsafe listening</strong></h3>
<p>The World Health Organization has <a href="http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/MLS/en/">warned</a> that millions of adolescents and young adults are at the risk of developing hearing loss due to frequent exposure to high sound levels in noisy entertainment venues and with the unsafe use of personal listening devices.</p>
<p>Smartphones have provided a means by which to download music for free and the ability to listen to this at the maximum volume without sound quality distortion. Subsequently, this means more people than ever are at risk of hearing loss if the necessary precautions are not taken.</p>
<h3><strong>Maximum noise exposure levels</strong></h3>
<p>A number of countries have suggested maximum noise exposure levels for personal listening devices to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, but these have typically applied to occupational noise-induced hearing loss criteria. As an example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has limited the daily safe volume level of any sound to below 85 decibels (dB) for a maximum of eight hours and Canadian federal regulations limit the sound exposure level to less than eight hours at 87 decibels adjusted (dBA).</p>
<h3><strong>Sound pressure levels in smartphones</strong></h3>

<p>To do this, they looked at two models from the three most popular smartphone companies in the Republic of Korea: the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 3, the Apple iPhone 5S and iPhone 6, and the LG G2 and G3. They measured the sound pressure outputs using a sound level meter across the models at the volume prompting the hearing loss risk warning (if present) and at the maximum volume level, across four genres of music.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the first hearing loss warning was prompted at the highest volume on the LG G2 phone at 92.4 dBA and at the lowest volume on the Samsung Galaxy S6 at 84.1dBA. The iPhone 6 had the loudest maximum volume warning at 113.1 dBA and the Galaxy Note 3 had the quietest at 107.03dBA.</p>
<p>Dr Han and Dr Kim also looked at the sound pressure outputs from different music genres, including three genres of K-pop music (dance-pop, hip-hop, and pop-ballad) and the US pop chart and found dance-pop had the highest volume output level at 91.1 dBA on all smartphones.</p>
<p>The study confirms a significant 8-dB difference in the sound pressure levels for six kinds of smartphone at the first risk volume level, indicating the need for an international standard for the safe use of personal listening devices.</p>

<p>PLOS, together with the Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Cell families of journals issued a joint statement that addresses a recently <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-pruitt-proposes-rule-strengthen-science-used-epa-regulations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed rule</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p>PLOS has always been a strong proponent of sharing data to improve the transparency of scientific research, but we recognize that some datasets cannot be made publicly available for ethical reasons. The EPA proposed rule is presented as informed by the journals’ policies. However, insisting on public availability of data would allow the EPA to exclude relevant data simply because it cannot be made publicly available. We believe this could prevent the use of relevant scientific evidence in the regulatory process.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>In 1914, the psychologist Leta Hollingworth’s experiments punctured holes in the prevailing idea that menstruating affects women’s intellect. But a century on, the ovulation cycle continues to interest psychologists, who today focus on how it affects sexual behaviour. A popular evolutionary psychology theory states that during fertile periods, women become more interested in men who use dominant masculine behaviour, as this signals they are likely to provide good genes for any offspring. A University of Goettingen team have now conducted the largest ever test of this idea, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/7g3xc/">published as a pre-print</a> at PsyArxiv.</p>
<p><span id="more-33789"></span></p>
<p>The “good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis” or GGOSH suggests that during fertile phases of the menstrual cycle women should be especially attracted to potential mates who are likely to provide good genes to their offspring. The hypothesis further states that such genes are signalled through men’s sexual assertiveness and confidence, via behaviours like flirting, smiling and directly gazing at women.</p>
<p>The evidence for GGOSH is sketchy. There are two relevant meta-analyses, both published in 2014 – one in <em><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-06327-001">Psychological Bulletin</a></em>, the other in <em><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073914523073">Emotion Review</a></em> – but only the first supported the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Enter the new study, led by Julia Jünger. Employing a stronger design than past research, her team tested the same subjects repeatedly (at different times in their cycle) rather than relying on different participants. They also used larger sample sizes and collected hormone data via saliva samples to validate the self-reports of where the women were on their cycle. The study was also pre-registered and the data made available for other researchers to review.</p>
<p>The 157 participants, heterosexual women aged 18-35, took part twice, in the fertile and the luteal (non-fertile) phases of their menstrual cycle. On each occasion, the women saw a series of 30-second video clips of single men in real interactions with an attractive woman they’d just met (however the woman was not visible in the clips). The men’s behaviour varied in the amount they smiled, the time they spent gazing at the woman’s face, how much they spoke during the clip, and other flirtatious actions.</p>
<p>During the more fertile period of their cycle, the women found the men more sexually attractive – on average, they were more interested in pursuing a potentially short-term and purely sexual relationship with them (a pattern that was mediated by the levels of the hormone estriadol in their saliva: more estriadol correlated with more attraction), and they were more interested in long-term relationships with them too.</p>
<p>This fertility-attraction link confirms a well-established finding, but the GGOSH makes a much more specific prediction – that women will find dominant, flirtatious behaviours in particular more attractive during fertility, and here the data suggested otherwise. Eye contact, confident body language, smiles – none of these mattered more during greater fertility, against the predictions of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>The GGOSH also predicts that good-gene markers will be particularly valued by fertile-phase women who are already in a relationship (the idea is that they already have a safe nest in which to raise a kid, so will not be too fussed that dominant mates with good genes may be less reliable). In fact, the dominant “good genes” behaviours weren’t any more attractive to partnered women during their fertile phase. This is two firm strikes against the hypothesis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, the women’s relationship status did make a difference to their overall levels of attraction in the men – when the researchers conducted their analyses separately for partnered and single women, they found that it was only partnered women whose overall sexual interest in the men increased during the fertile phase of their cycle, perhaps, the researchers suggested, because having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a partner they can rely on to raise a family increases women’s interest in sex (though it would be easy to have come up with an ad-hoc evolutionary explanation for the complete opposite result, so I would suggest waiting for this finding to be replicated before drawing conclusions).</p>
<p>Returning to the GGSOH, while this research reaffirmed that the ovulatory cycle affects women’s interest in sex, thanks to shifts in hormones, it does not support the hypothesis that it swivels their minds towards a different object of desire. So if any aspiring pick-up gurus were hoping to build a creepy philosophy around switching up your style at points in the cycle, they will be disappointed. And women shouldn’t be concerned that during times when their body is amping up sexual desire it is also dictating who that desire should be projected towards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<br /><br /><br />How is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0039" target="_blank" title="knowledge about the meanings of words, objects, and other entities">semantic knowledge</a> represented and stored in the brain? A classic way of addressing this question is via single-case studies of patients with brain lesions that lead to a unique pattern of deficits. <a href="https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/agnosia/" target="_blank">Agnosia</a> is the inability to recognize some class (or classes) of entities such as objects or persons. Agnosia in the visual modality is most widely studied, but agnosias in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726291" target="_blank" title="impairments in sound perception and identification despite intact hearing, cognitive functioning, and language abilities">auditory</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p5563" target="_blank">olfactory</a> modalities have been reported as well. A key element is that basic sensory processing is intact, but higher-order recognition of complex entities is impaired.<br /><br />Agnosias that are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907231" target="_blank">specific</a> for items in a particular category (e.g., animals, fruits/vegetables, tools, etc.) are sometimes observed. An ongoing debate posits that some category-specific dissociations may fall out along sensory/functional lines (the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7885576" target="_blank">Warrington</a> view), or along domain-specific lines (the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907231" target="_blank">Caramazza</a> view).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> The former suggests that knowledge of living things is more reliant on vision (you don't pick up and use an alligator), while knowledge of tools is more reliant on how you use them. The latter hypothesis suggests that evolutionary pressures led to distinct neural systems for processing different categories of objects.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />Much less work has examined how nonverbal auditory knowledge is represented in the brain. A new paper reports on a novel category-specific deficit in an expert bird-watcher who developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_dementia" target="_blank" title="a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of semantic memory in both the verbal and non-verbal domains">semantic dementia</a> (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218301179" target="_blank">Muhammed et al., 2018</a>). Patient BA lost the ability to identify birds by their songs, but not by their appearance. As explained by the authors: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">BA is a dedicated amateur birder with some 30 years’ experience,  including around 10 weeks each spring spent in birdwatching expeditions  and over the years had also regularly attended courses in bird call  recognition, visual identification and bird behaviour. He had extensive  exposure to a range of bird species representing all major regions and  habitats of the British Isles. He had noted waning of his ability to  name birds or identify them from their calls over a similar timeframe to  his evolving difficulty with general vocabulary. At the time of  assessment, he was also becoming less competent at identifying birds  visually but he continued to enjoy recognising and feeding the birds  that visited his garden. There had been no suggestion of any difficulty  recognising familiar faces or household items nor any difficulty  recognising the voices of telephone callers or everyday noises. There  had been no evident change in BA's appreciation of music.</blockquote><br />BA's brain showed a pattern of degeneration characteristic of semantic dementia, with asymmetric atrophy affecting the anterior, medial, and inferior temporal lobes, to a greater extent in the left hemisphere.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Eocmzuwv80/WuacMHg2zeI/AAAAAAAAMhU/UsNSz5_9J9otZlTAw1jnwWC2pEVezal4gCLcBGAs/s1600/BA%2Bbird%2Bcall%2Bbrain.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="514" data-original-width="1600" height="127" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Eocmzuwv80/WuacMHg2zeI/AAAAAAAAMhU/UsNSz5_9J9otZlTAw1jnwWC2pEVezal4gCLcBGAs/s400/BA%2Bbird%2Bcall%2Bbrain.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span><br /><b>Fig. 1 (modified from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218301179" target="_blank">Muhammed et al., 2018</a>).</b> <i>Note that L side of brain shown on R side of scan.</i> Coronal sections of BA's T1-weighted volumetric brain MRI through <b>(A)</b> temporal poles; <b>(B)</b> mid-anterior temporal lobes; and <b>(C)</b> temporo-parietal junctional zones.

Interestingly, he performed as well as controls on tests of famous  voices and famous face pictures.<br /><br />Thus, the findings suggest separate auditory and visual routes to avian conceptual knowledge, at least in this expert birder. Also fascinating was the preservation of famous person identification via voice and image. The authors conclude with a ringing endorsement of single case studies in neuropsychology:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">This analysis transcends the effects of acquired expertise and  illustrates how single case experiments that address apparently  idiosyncratic phenomena can illuminate neuropsychological processes of  more general relevance.</blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: right;"><span>link via <a href="https://twitter.com/utafrith/status/990546566552412161" target="_blank">@utafrith</a></span></div><br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />Caramazza A, Mahon BZ.

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9495">Why I Became a Neuroscientist</a></h4>

I’ve been thinking lately about the question of what leads scientists to choose a discipline. Why does someone end up as a chemist rather than a biologist? A geneticist as opposed to a cognitive neuroscientist?

We might hope that people choose their discipline based on an understanding of what doing research in each discipline involves, but I don't think this often happens. I know it didn't happen in my case. Here, then, is how I became a neuroscientist.



As far back as I can remember,

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/542172078/0/oupblogpsychology/">Supporting grieving students at school following crisis events</a></h4>

<p>Tragic events such as recent natural disasters and shootings at school affect many children and families. Although these events typically receive immediate media coverage and short-term supports, the long-term implications are often overlooked. The grief among children and adolescents experiencing significant loss generally emerges during the weeks and months following such tragic events. Although there are variations in the expression of grief, bereaved children and adolescents often struggle to meet the cognitive demands of school. Professionals at school, including, school psychologists, school counselors, and other mental health professionals have a tremendous opportunity to help identify and support students in need. Such support at school is helpful in facilitating healthy adjustment and coping strategies among bereaved students.</p>
<h3>Understanding grief and mourning</h3>
<p>The term <em>grief</em> refers to an individual’s personal experience, thoughts, and feelings associated with a loss. The term <em>mourning</em> refers to the externalized manifestation of grief. Mourning rituals, such as funerals, memorial services, and commemorative activities can facilitate grief. Culture influences the grieving process, and it is important to consider the vast range of ways that individuals and families mourn the death of others. For example, being sensitive to family preferences surrounding funerals or memorials helps ensure that you’re honoring their beliefs and values. It is also critical to note that some individuals may not feel comfortable expressing their grief at school, and instead prefer to do it privately with family.</p>
<p>Grief is often emotional and can bring up different feelings simultaneously, such as sadness, anger, fear, or worry. Grief is also physical and can be felt in different parts of a person’s body. A child or adult who is grieving may have trouble sleeping, eating, and may experience somatic difficulties such as headaches or stomachaches. Finally, grief can also show up in someone’s behaviors, such as through crying, separating oneself from other people, and having trouble focusing or sitting still. At the same time, other individuals may appear to be less affected, despite the fact that they may still be experiencing many of these symptoms. This is because for some people, depending on their age and ability to deal with their grief, they want to continue to have control over their life and maintain normal routines. This can sometimes be helpful for them to manage their grief, especially while at school or in public. Because of the widespread effects grief can have on an individual’s functioning, it is critical that students, school-staff, and parents obtain effective support when grieving the death of one or more significant person.</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote">
<p>Elementary school children (6-12) are typically able to relate to death more easily than younger children.</p>
</blockquote></div>
<h3>Considerations for schools and families</h3>
<p>Children express grief differently due to a variety of factors, including their age, cognitive abilities, and cultural surroundings. Young children are typically better able to express their grief through play, make-believe, and drawings instead of verbally. They also tend to be more vulnerable to the withdrawal or excessive displays of grief of their caregivers and need consistent love and support. Elementary school children (6-12) are typically able to relate to death more easily than younger children and ask a lot of questions and obtain knowledge to better understand what happened. Within this age range, they understand that death is final and that all living things die. Adolescents (13-18) are sometimes more self-conscious and although they may be spending more time with friends, they may be less likely to share their feelings with their friends. Typically around ages 15-18, they feel more comfortable expressing their feelings and their grief is more similar to that of adults.</p>
<p>Regardless of age, grief can significantly affect children and teenagers in various ways. Because of the variety of symptoms someone may experience when grieving, he or she may be less focused or motivated in school, or appear more withdrawn or tired. Furthermore, because a grieving youth may be experiencing a range of emotions, with some being uncomfortable for that individual, the youth may experience sudden outbursts of either anger or sadness. Families and schools are encouraged to remember that this is to be expected, and that youth need to be supported when experiencing these difficult emotions. However, additional support and follow-up may be needed if the youth is exhibiting a significant loss of interest in daily activities, is chronically absent, and has a significant fear of being alone, among other symptoms. These changes should be significant and not minor.</p>
<p>Additional support and follow-up may occur in a variety of ways, such as having a school-based mental health professional, like a school psychologist or counselor, provide individual or group support to the youth. This will enable the youth to process difficult feelings, have the opportunity to share their story, and talk about positive and difficult memories. When appropriate, receiving support through a grief group can be particularly effective, as it can help normalize their feelings and make the youth feel less alone. Ensuring that teachers and families are knowledgeable about the grief process and how to effectively support grieving youth is also critical. It may be particularly difficult for teachers or families who are also grieving the same death as the youth, emphasizing the importance of self-care and support for adults. Given that most children will experience the death of at least one close or special person prior to high school graduation, and because the vast majority of children ages 7 to 18 attend school on a regular basis, it is essential that school-based professionals be prepared to effectively support bereaved students.</p>

<h4>Ken Dawson-Scully Named Associate V.P. for Strategic Initiatives, Head of Institutional Partnerships at FAU and MPFI</h4>
<p>Florida Atlantic University and Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) have combined forces to form the first jointly supported position between the two institutions. As of May 1, Ken Dawson-Scully, Ph.D., will be newly appointed to the role of associate vice president for strategic initiatives and head of institutional partnerships for FAU and MPFI. Joining FAU in 2008, Dawson-Scully served as associate director of the FAU Brain Institute and most recently as an associate professor of biological sciences and associate dean for graduate studies in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.</p>
<p>“For almost a decade, the close and synergistic partnership between Florida Atlantic University and Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience has been undeniably beneficial for our institutions and Palm Beach County,” said FAU President John Kelly. “This latest initiative will foster tremendous returns on our co-investment for educational and research opportunities, economic development, as well as faculty and student recruitment. Together, we will continue to strengthen our thriving alliance; enhancing recognition and visibility both locally and globally.”<br />
In this joint FAU/MPFI position, Dawson-Scully will work closely with the executive leadership team of both institutions under the direction of Matthias Haury, Ph.D., MPFI’s COO and Jeff Atwater, FAU’s vice president for strategic initiatives and CFO.</p>
<p>“We are excited to further reinforce the flourishing relationship with our partners at Florida Atlantic University. Our joint efforts will continue to facilitate unique collaborative opportunities between our institutions and inspire a vibrant, creative space where groundbreaking innovations in science and technology will prosper,” said David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and scientific director of MPFI. “This collaborative environment will allow us the opportunity to better tackle the areas of focus that are critical to the success of both of our institutions’ missions, goals and aspirations.”</p>
<p>In his new role, Dawson-Scully will be responsible for developing and implementing key initiatives in areas that are crucial to FAU and MPFI. These initiatives will include co-branding programs, enhancing infrastructure, developing new educational programs, identifying and securing joint funding opportunities, conducting research training, building partnerships, and fostering collaboration between academic and administrative units.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the head of this new initiative, Dawson-Scully will act as a liaison for both institutes, developing and sustaining strong relationships with local and international foundations, corporations, government and community groups.</p>
<p>“I am both honored and excited to serve in this new capacity for Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience and Florida Atlantic University. My ultimate goal is to escalate our international reputation and expand our distinguished faculty, recruiting talented students and world-class scientists to our institutions,” said Dawson-Scully. “By combining our expertise, knowledge and resources, our close partnership will generate significant impact, benefitting the local, regional and international communities.”</p>
<p>The most recent joint program, where FAU and MPFI have partnered, is the FAU Max Planck Honors Program. The FAU MPHP is an elite undergraduate program that can be accomplished as an undergraduate student, in either FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College or the College of Science, focused on the John D. MacArthur Campus at Jupiter. Applications for the first cohort for this fall are due April 30, and more information for the FAU MPHP can be found at http://fau.edu/mphp.</p>
<p>Dawson-Scully received his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 2003, and his M.Sc. from Queen’s University in 1998. He currently serves on the steering committee and is a faculty member of the newly formed International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS). A highly accomplished researcher, his work investigates ways to protect the brain from neurodegeneration caused by acute or chronic cellular stress using the genetic model organism, the fruit fly or D. melanogaster. Dawson-Scully has identified a number of molecular targets in the fruit fly nervous system that can rescue the damaging effects of pathological conditions such as high temperature, low oxygen, and oxidative stress. This impactful research opens up new avenues for the future treatment of human diseases such as stroke and epilepsy. His findings, which have been successfully translated from fly, to zebrafish, fresh water turtle, and mouse, have led to the submissions of four novel United States patents for the medical treatment of febrile seizure, migraine, and stroke in humans. Dawson-Scully also serves as the chief scientific officer for Neuro Pharmalogics, Inc., an FAU Tech Runway® start-up company that has licensed his intellectual property for the purpose of creating novel therapeutics aimed at combating brain related diseases.</p>

<p>In the adverts for anti-ageing skin products, everyone is smiling, positively blooming with youthfulness. A canny move by the marketeers you might think – after all, past research has found most of us believe smiling makes people look younger. It’s just that actually, it doesn’t. It makes you look older. That’s according to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1306-8">a new paper</a> in <em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</em> that explores an intriguing mismatch between our beliefs and perceptions.</p>
<p><span id="more-33772"></span></p>
<p>Tzvi Ganel at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Melvyn Goodale at the University of Western Ontario began by asking 40 participants (23 women; average age 24) to estimate the age of 35 women and 35 men from photographs of their faces. Participants saw one of two versions of each model’s face, in which they were either smiling or had a neutral expression. On average, the participants rated the faces as older, by about a year, when they saw them smiling compared with when they had a neutral expression.</p>
<p>Despite this, most of the participants (33/40) stated afterwards that they believed smiling makes you look younger. Also, when asked to estimate the average age they’d given for all of the smiling faces they’d viewed and the average age they’d given to the neutral faces, they thought erroneously that they’d rated the smiling faces as younger (presumably in keeping with their belief that smiling makes you look younger).</p>
<p>These new results are consistent with <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-015-0822-7">an earlier series of studies</a> by Ganel in which he presented evidence that the ageing effect of smiling (on this occasion of one to two years) is due to the way it increases wrinkles around the eyes. For instance, the ageing effect disappeared when he filtered out eye wrinkles or presented only the lower half of smiling faces.</p>
<p>In the this latest research, Ganel and Goodale followed up with a second experiment in which 42 more participants estimated the ages of faces that were either smiling, neutral or looking surprised. Again, the same person’s face was estimated to be older when smiling compared with when holding a neutral expression. Meanwhile surprised faces were rated as younger than neutral faces, perhaps because the facial expression of surprise acts to smooth out eye wrinkles.</p>
<p>When asked to estimate the average age they’d guessed for smiling, neutral and surprised faces, the participants again mistakenly thought that they’d rated smiling faces as younger than neutral faces. On the other hand, they estimated that they’d given the surprised faces the same average age as the neutral faces, seemingly unaware that they’d actually rated them as younger (presumably due to the lack of any specific beliefs about the effects of a surprised expression on appearance).</p>
<p>“The findings show, for the first time, that people can erroneously believe that smiling makes one appear younger, while at the same time rating smiling faces as older than neutral faces,” the researchers concluded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t tell from these findings what part memory plays in the effects, if any. Did participants mistakenly think they’d estimated a younger average age for smiling faces because of the influence of their <em>belief</em> that smiling faces look younger or because they actually <em>remembered </em>the smiling faces as younger? Also, I wonder whether it makes any difference whether a smile is genuine or not – genuine or “Duchenne” smiles are known to involve more crinkling of the muscles around the eyes, so perhaps they have a greater ageing effect than feigned smiles.</p>
<p>These unresolved issues aside, the results suggest that if you’d like to present a more youthful version of yourself on your Twitter or Facebook page, you should delete that grinning selfie and switch for a neutral pose or even a look of surprise. Or you could just dig out an old photo of a younger you!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2018/04/26/mining-data-for-defect-prediction.html">Mining data for defect prediction</a></h4>

<p>Defect prediction relies on data and modelling techniques. Previous work has predominantly been focused to improving the latter. Despite numerous studies exploiting a wide range of machine learning techniques, prediction accuracies improve at a slow pace. On the other hand, the focus on data has somewhat been limited. High-quality data is difficult to obtain and mostly consists of metrics which have been lingering round for a long time. Due to the influx of digital data, other fields have developed some interesting techniques for its analysis. In this journal club I will discuss some of those techniques for data analysis and link them to their possible use in defect prediction.</p>
