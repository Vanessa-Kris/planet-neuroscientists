<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>You may be best advised not to read this article late at night or before you eat. Psychologists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Charles University in the Czech Republic have surveyed a large sample of non-clinical volunteers to gauge their reaction to 24 creatures that are commonly the source of specific animals phobias.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12409">published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em></a>, not only contribute to our understanding of animal phobias, but could prove incredibly useful to horror writers. Among the key findings is that spiders were unique in being both intensely fear- <em>and</em> disgust-inducing in equal measure. The researchers said this may be due to their mix of disgusting properties – including their “quirky ‘too-many-legs’ body plan” – combined with the fact they are “…omnipresent in our homes, often lurking in the hidden dark places and capable of fast unpredictable movement.” In other words, the intense fear arises in part from the prospect of coming into physical contact with a creature perceived by many to be revolting.</p>
<p><span id="more-37399"></span></p>
<p>Jakub Polák and his team recruited nearly 2000 people online and asked them to rate how frightening and disgusting they found 25 creatures, including – alongside the spider – a snail, dog, bull, maggot, cockroach, two kinds of snake (a viper and a grass snake), and ant. See the image above for the full list.</p>
<p>Depicted in photographs on-screen, this particular selection of species – aside from the red panda, which acted as a non-fear-inducing control – was chosen because they are frequently the source of animal phobias.</p>
<p>Categorising the creatures based on the levels of fear and disgust that they elicited, the researchers identified five groupings: fear-relevant, non-slimy small animals, such as cockroaches, ants and wasps; mouse-like animals, such as mouse, rat and bat, which scored low on elicited fear and disgust; snakes and lizards; parasites, such as lice and tapeworm, which triggered high disgust; and finally, farm or pet mammals, such as cat, dog and horse, which generally elicited low fear and disgust.</p>
<p>One explanation for common animal phobias is that they reflect an exaggerated, uncontrolled form of innate fears for certain creatures that we all share, particularly for creatures that imperilled our ancestors, such as spiders and snakes. Consistent with this evolutionary account, spiders and venomous snakes elicited the strongest fear reactions among the participants, while parasites elicited the strongest disgust reactions (consistent with the idea that disgust motivates a form of protective “behavioural avoidance”). However, less consistent with the evolutionary perspective on animal phobias is that 14 of the creatures elicited virtually no fear, including rats, mice and lizards, even though these animals are commonly the source of phobias.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that, similar to spiders, the parasitic creatures like tape-worm and roundworm were both highly disgust-inducing (even more than the spider) while at the same time being rated as highly fear-inducing (even more than, say, the wasp or grass-snake). <span>Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, this combined fear and disgust reaction to intestinal parasites has evolved because they infect us with microscopic larvae meaning we rarely see them with our eyes, yet we are aware they are omnipresent. Once again, as with spiders, we cannot rely only on disgust (and behavioural avoidance) to protect us, and so we also fear unwanted physical contact. The maggot, by contrast, may elicit less fear because it can be seen and avoided more easily.   </span></p>
<p>Some other details to emerge from the study are that women generally gave higher fear and disgust ratings than men, and especially for non-slimy invertebrates and repulsive human parasites – this may be in line with evolutionary theory because “women as a sex with higher reproductive cost need to be extra careful of pathogens threatening not only their health but also the [health] of their children.”</p>
<p>Also, the researchers asked their participants about any past traumatic experiences with animals, such as being seriously bitten by a dog or scratched by a cat. Surprisingly perhaps, they found that fear ratings were <em>lower</em> among people with such a bad experience in their past. However, this correlation makes sense if you consider that people with a greater fear of animals may be be more cautious and less likely to get hurt. “Our results … suggest that fear and disgust could protect subjects against harm even in our modern environment,” the researchers said. In excess, fear can be debilitating and unwelcome, but this last result is perhaps a reminder that it is also there to serve a purpose – including to protect us from the creatures that may bite us while we sleep or infect us from within.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Hearing voices that don’t exist in the outside world is the most common form of hallucination experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related conditions and it can be very distressing. However, there is a growing recognition that hearing voices is not always pathological. Many mentally well people hear voices (or “auditory verbal hallucinations”) – in fact, around 6-7 per cent of adults in the general population report having had such experiences at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>This has led some experts to propose a “continuum model” in which the same fundamental underlying mechanism leads to hearing voices in healthy people and in patients with a clinical diagnosis, but that for various reasons, such as a traumatic past, the experience is more troublesome and distressing for the patients. However, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/45/4/733/5149404">a new open-access paper</a> in <em>Schizophrenia Bulletin</em> challenges the continuum model, finding an important brain difference between patients who hear voices and voice-hearing healthy controls.</p>
<p><span id="more-37393"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Jane Garrison and Iris Sommer, recruited three groups matched for age, education, sex, handedness and overall brain volume: 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related conditions such as nonspecific psychosis or schizoaffective disorder) who hear voices; 50 non-clinical healthy volunteers who hear voices (at least once per week); and 50 healthy controls who do not hear voices.</p>
<p>The researchers scanned all their participants’ brains, specifically looking at the length of a brain structure involved in “reality monitoring” or telling the difference between internally and externally generated experiences. For instance, a typical test of reality monitoring involves asking a person to read or imagine different words, and then asking them to recall which words they’d read and which they’d imagined.</p>
<p>Garrison and her colleagues wanted to test the idea that a problem with reality monitoring contributes to the voice-hearing experience in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy people who hear voices. To test this account, they used the scans to measure the length of a brain structure called the paracingulate sulcus (PCS) – this is the most frontal area of the medial prefrontal cortex and previous research has suggested that it is involved in reality monitoring. For instance, people for whom the PCS is completely absent (up to a quarter of the general population by some estimates) tend to struggle with reality monitoring tasks.</p>
<p>As they predicted, the researchers found that their patient volunteers had a shorter PCS than the healthy non-voice-hearing controls, <em>and</em> a shorter PCS than the voice-hearing healthy controls. In contrast, there was no (statistically significant) difference in the length of the PCS between the voice-hearing healthy controls and the controls who did not have hallucinations.</p>
<p>Garrison’s team believe this result is consistent with there being two routes to auditory hallucinations (see image, above). For healthy people who hear voices, the researchers believe the origin is in hyper-activation of sensory parts of the brain involved in processing auditory information. For patients with schizophrenia, by contrast, they believe there is a sensory component combined with a problem with reality monitoring.</p>
<p>“These findings, together with our previous work, corroborate a model in which part of the mechanism underlying hallucinations is shared between clinical and nonclinical individuals with hallucinations,” the researchers said, “while a second mechanism, compromising [in]adequate reality monitoring, is present in patients only.”</p>
<p>This two-route model could explain some of the differences in the voice-hearing experience reported by patients and healthy voice-hearers, such as the lower frequency and shorter duration of the experience in the latter group. In healthy voice-hearers, hyper-activation of sensory areas is likely to be a relatively exceptional event, and their intact reality monitoring can also suppress the experience. For patients, by contrast, hyper-activation of sensory areas may not need to be so intense, and they may not have the necessary reality monitoring capabilities to inhibit or make sense of their hallucinations – consequently their voice hearing is more frequent and long-lasting.</p>
<p>The new findings also chime with past research that has suggested important differences between clinical and non-clinical voice hearers at a neurobiological level. For instance, patients with schizophrenia have been shown to have heightened synthesis of the brain chemical dopamine, potentially contributing to seeing intense meaning in sensations and experiences (known as “aberrant salience”), whereas non-clinical voice hearers do not show this same abundance of dopamine.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that the new findings – and the two-route model – cannot account for some of the differences in the experiences of patients who hear voices and healthy people who hear voices, such as the more negative (angry, upsetting and controlling) content in the hallucinations reported by patients.</p>
<p>Also, it’s worth noting that, among the healthy voice-hearers in this study, the length of the PCS was intermediary between the patients and non-voice-hearing controls. It’s possible, the researchers admitted, that the reason the difference in PCS length between the two healthy groups was found to be statistically non-significant may have been due to a lack of statistical power. They said that replication of this study with larger samples could clarify this issue, adding that “…further research is [also] needed to to assess the extent to which the present results generalise to other nonclinical populations with hallucinations who may have different etiology and phenomenology of hallucinatory experience.”</p>

<p>There is increasing recognition that while our personality traits are stable enough to shape our lives profoundly, they are also partly malleable, so that our choices and experiences can feedback and influence the kind of people we become. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300825">new study</a> in the<em> Journal of Research in Personality</em> shines a light on a highly consequential behaviour that captures this dynamic – smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>The results add “… to existing knowledge on the implications of smoking by showing that this behaviour is also likely to alter individuals’ characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-37376"></span></p>
<p>It’s already well established that, by virtue of their traits, some people are more disposed than others to take up smoking – namely those who are more extraverted, less emotionally stable and less conscientious. The new research, led by Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier, suggests (but does not prove) that this habit can then feedback and shape smokers’ traits.</p>
<p>Using repeated measures of people’s personality traits over many years, the researchers report that smokers display personality changes that are different from those seen in non-smokers, especially in terms of reduced emotional stability and reduced extraversion.</p>
<p>The data come from five large surveys of middle-aged and older volunteers, four in the US and one in Japan. Ranging in size from just over 600 participants to over 6000, the surveys included information on whether the participants smoked and measures of their personality traits collected repeatedly over time spans from 4 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that smokers showed declines in emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness, relative to non-smokers. However, the precise patterns of change varied across the different samples. The most consistent pattern was for smokers to show relative declines in emotional stability and extraversion.</p>
<p>Stephan and his team also looked to see if stopping smoking had any positive personality consequences. In fact, there was little evidence of this. If anything, stopping smoking was associated with declines in agreeableness. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because of a loss of “smoking-related social interactions”; residual adverse effects of smoking; and due to health-related side-effects associated with smoking cessation, such as “heightened risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes” both of which are known to have unhelpful consequences for personality traits.</p>
<p>The study is impressive for the size of the samples and the use of a longitudinal methodology that followed the same people over time. However, it’s limited by the reliance on participants’ self-reports of their own traits; the lack of information on smoking intensity; the skew towards older participants; and it’s inability to offer insights into why smoking would seem to lead to mostly adverse personality changes.</p>
<p>The researchers speculated that the health-related harms of smoking might be a factor mediating the habit’s apparent effects on personality. Health consequences of smoking such as insomnia, depression and reduced cardio-vascular fitness are known to have negative effects on personality. “Furthermore,” Stephan’s team add, “smoking may alter the energetic capacities needed to maintain emotional stability, the tendency to be exploratory, cooperative and altruistic, self-disciplined and playful, and enthusiastic and active.”</p>
<p>A curious detail in the findings is that, unlike the US samples, differences in personality change were not found among smokers in Japan compared with non-smokers. The researchers said this result may be an extension of what has become known as the “Japanese smoking paradox” – the fact that even though smoking rates are higher in Japan than the US, rates of lung cancer and mortality risk are lower.</p>
<p>Overall, this new research represents “the largest and longest longitudinal examination of the association between smoking and personality change in adulthood,” the researchers said. The results suggest that the “deleterious effects of smoking may extend to detrimental personality changes,” they added.</p>
<p>However, and as the researchers acknowledge, this conclusion, while highly plausible, comes with a hefty caveat – the observational study design cannot prove that smoking causes personality change. It’s possible that another factor or factors, such as stressful life circumstances, both increase the likelihood of people taking up smoking and cause unwelcome long-term personality changes. It’s also possible that pre-existing personality dispositions drive both the uptake of smoking and the later trajectory of personality change over time.</p>
<p>Future research that collects more detailed baseline contextual data on participants may be able to test these possibilities. In the meantime, if you are ever tempted to take up smoking, it is worth considering that it is not just your health you are putting at risk, but quite likely also your personality.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The “learning style” myth – the idea that we each have a preferred modality for learning, usually described as visual, auditory or kinaesthetic – just won’t die. Belief in learning styles endures even though psychologists have pointed out repeatedly the many problems with the concept. Students <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">don’t benefit from learning in their supposedly preferred style</a>, for example, and teachers and their pupils <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/">don’t agree on the pupil’s learning style</a> in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But exactly how believers in learning styles conceive of the concept has until now remained unclear. It could be that people take an “essentialist” view that our learning style is something we are born with, for instance. On the other hand, they may believe that learning styles are more liable to change – a “non-essentialist” perspective. A new study in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/edu0000366">the Journal of Educational Psychology</a> has found that, in fact, both views are common, a result that could have implications for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37366"></span></p>
<p>Shaylene Nancekivell and colleagues at the University of Michigan asked 331 adults who believed in learning styles to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with 15 statements that laid out an essentialist view of the myth. These ranged from suggesting that learning styles are innate (e.g. “In the future, scientists will be able to determine a person’s learning style by examining their genes”) to implying that learning styles can predict success (e.g. “A person’s learning style predicts the kinds of teachers from whom they learn best”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall the participants’ responses were quite inconsistent: for example, they tended to agree that learning styles can be detected in childhood, but disagree that they are inherited from their parents. And the average rating for all statements fell almost exactly in the midpoint of the scale.</p>
<p>However, further analysis revealed two key subgroups hiding in the pool of participants. Based on patterns in their responses, the researchers identified one group they called “essentialisers”, who more strongly endorsed more of the statements, and another group of “non-essentialisers”.</p>
<p>The researchers then ran a second experiment to find out more about the beliefs of the two groups. Participants read a short story about a baby whose biological and adoptive parents had different learning styles (one set of parents were “visual” learners and the other “kinaesthetic”, for instance). The essentialisers indicated that the child was most likely to develop the learning style of their biological parents, while the non-essentialisers rated the learning style of the adoptive parents higher. Essentialisers were also more likely to believe statements relating learning styles to brain differences, such as “Brain imaging can be used to identify a person’s learning style.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results suggest that people’s beliefs about learning styles vary much more than previous studies have recognised, the authors say. Some people appear to believe more strongly than others that learning styles are hard-wired in our brains and genes – and this could potentially make them more resistant to efforts to debunk the myth, the researchers suggest. “The present studies provide a new starting point for research on learning styles and suggest that future research on neuroscience-based myths needs to move beyond merely assessing the rate at which they are endorsed,” they write.</p>
<p>It would be useful to know whether certain individuals are predisposed to being essentialisers, but for now this remains unclear. Neither age, gender nor level of education predicted which participants were in which group. And most dishearteningly, the teachers who took part in this new research were just as likely to take an essentialist view of learning styles as the remaining participants. If essentialist views about learning styles really are more resistant to change, then understanding what makes a person think that way will be important for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Quelle est la part de l’inné et de l’acquis dans l’intelligence, ou plus généralement dans les facultés cognitives ? C’est une question très controversée, en particulier parce qu’elle a une grande portée politique : l’éducation est-elle importante, ou bien tout est-il prédéterminé par nos gènes ? Il est évident que dans le second cas, investir dans l’éducation semble vain ; il devrait plutôt s’agir de faire de la sélection et de l’orientation que de l’éducation.</p>
<p>Il existe une littérature scientifique abondante sur ce sujet, malheureusement ses résultats sont souvent mal interprétés et déformés par des idéologues. Prenons l’exemple d’une <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/les-profs-tombent-dans-le-piege-de-l-adn_2083387.html">récente tribune</a> de l’essayiste Laurent Alexandre dans l’Express :</p>
<p><em>« 64% de nos différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques ; l’école et la famille n’ont malheureusement qu’un rôle marginal face à nos chromosomes ».</em></p>
<p>Je vais supposer que la première assertion est correcte et bien établie scientifiquement. La conclusion est non seulement fausse, mais absurde. Revenons quelques siècles en arrière. Génétiquement, la population était sensiblement la même qu’aujourd’hui. Mais peu de gens apprenaient à lire, donc peu de gens savaient lire. Par conséquent, oui, l’éducation et la famille ont un rôle déterminant dans les capacités de lecture. Par ailleurs, si l’on avait fait la même étude sur la population de l’époque, on aurait trouvé non pas 64% mais une proportion bien plus faible de déterminisme génétique, puisque les capacités de lecture étaient en premier lieu déterminées par la possibilité d’apprendre à lire. Inversement, si l’éducation était la même pour toute, par exemple si on avait institué une école publique pour tous avec des programmes nationaux strictement appliqués de manière uniforme, eh bien on trouverait que très peu de différences de quoi que ce soit sont expliquées par l’éducation, puisque ce ne serait pas un facteur variable.</p>
<p>Une assertion du type « 64% des différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques » est une mesure contextuelle, qui reflète en grande partie la variabilité de chacun des facteurs. En aucun cas elle n’indique un rôle causal faible pour l’éducation ou l’environnement familial. Elle peut tout aussi bien indiquer une certaine homogénéité de l’éducation reçue. Tout ce qu’elle indique, tout ce qu’indique cette littérature en général, c’est que les facultés cognitives sont influencées par des facteurs à la fois génétiques et environnementaux.</p>
<p>Etant donné que l’on ne sait pas lire spontanément mais uniquement après l’avoir appris, il faut une certaine dose d’aveuglement idéologique pour prétendre que l’école y joue un « rôle marginal ». Certes, il faut aussi avoir un cerveau pour pouvoir lire, d’où les facteurs génétiques. Par exemple, un ver de terre ne sait pas lire. Rien n’indique cependant que ces « 64% » de variation d’origine génétique concernent le cerveau. Il faut aussi des yeux pour pouvoir lire, par exemple. Des difficultés de lecture liés à un problème ophtalmologique d’origine génétique seront comptées dans ce total. De même, si (expérience de pensée) l’éducation des enfants étaient biaisée en fonction de facteurs physiques d’origine génétique, alors ce biais apparaîtrait également comme facteur génétique. Ce n’est sans doute pas ce que l’on veut dire par « facteur génétique des capacités de lecture », mais c’est quand même ce qui est mesuré.</p>
<p>La question qui a un intérêt politique, ce n’est pas : quelle part de la variabilité des capacités de lecture dans un contexte éducatif et socioculturel donné peut être expliqué par des variations génétiques (neurogénétiques ou non, purement biologiques ou conditionnés à des facteurs socioculturels) mais plutôt : dans quelle mesure améliorer l’éducation peut-il améliorer les capacités de lecture ? Pour répondre, on peut faire appel à l’histoire plutôt qu’à la génétique, et la conclusion est sans appel : historiquement, plus de gens ont su lire lorsqu’on leur a enseigné la lecture.</p>
<p>En résumé, oui l’éducation a un rôle majeur dans les capacités cognitives comme la lecture, et la science ne dit pas le contraire. Evidemment.</p>

<p>It usually helps to “get a fresh pair of eyes” on a problem, especially from someone with a different perspective than your own. But what if you could find a variety of vantage points from within yourself? After all, each of us has multiple roles and identities in life. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, a team led by Sarah Gaither at Duke University presents evidence that prompting children to think about their own multiple identities boosts their problem-solving skills and increases their flexible thinking.</p>
<p>“Someone can be a woman and White, a teacher and a parent, a girl and a friend,” the researchers write. “Although individuals may not automatically reflect on their multiple identities, here we propose that when they do, it may have positive consequences for their creative problem solving and flexible thinking.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37354"></span></p>
<p>In the first of three studies, Gaither and her team split 48 six- and seven-year-olds into two groups. One was the intervention group and these participants spent time reflecting briefly with a researcher about eight of their various social identities, such as “friend”, “girl” and “reader”. This process concluded with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you are lots of things at the same time.” The other group served as a control and these participants chatted briefly with a researcher about eight of their different physical attributes, such as having two feet and a mouth. Similar to the intervention condition, the control condition ended with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you have a lot of things at the same time.”</p>
<p>Afterwards all the children completed four different problem solving and flexible thinking challenges. One test involved them figuring out how a bear with a bowl of lego could reach honey in a high branch on a tree* (they were told that even stacked together the lego couldn’t reach). Another test involved coming up with novel uses for a gold box. The third involved categorising a collection of photos of 16 individuals in as many ways as possible. The last task involved an interaction with a puppet who made 16 claims about different pairs of items or individuals belonging to the same category, such as a dog and cat being the same kind of animal, or a male and female child being the same kind of person. When the child agreed the puppet was correct, this was taken as a sign of flexible thinking.</p>
<p>The findings were consistent, with the children who reflected on their multiple identities outperforming the children in the control condition on all four of the tests. For instance, half the children in the multiple identities condition solved the bear puzzle, compared with just 12.5 per cent of the control condition children; and the children agreed with the puppets’ broad-minded thinking over six times, on average, compared with under four times on average among the controls.</p>
<p>In two follow-up studies with dozens more children, the researchers showed that reflecting on another person’s multiple identities, as opposed to one’s own, did not have the same benefit; and that some of the performance gains associated with thinking about one’s own multiple identities were greater when these were phrased in a way that made them sound a stable part of the self rather than a transient preference – reflecting on being <em>a helper</em> rather than enjoying helping, for instance.</p>
<p>Past research with adults had already shown benefits to creative thinking of reflecting on one’s own different social identities. This new research builds on those findings by extending them to children, and showing that the benefits are limited to reflecting on one’s own social identities, as opposed to one’s physical attributes, or reflecting on the social identities of others. The new results also jibe with past research showing that travelling abroad and visiting other cultures can increase open-mindedness and creativity. It’s possible that reflecting on one’s own varied social identities helps to activate memories of diverse experiences and perspectives, thus helping trigger more flexible thinking – however, more research is needed to identify the precise mechanisms at play.</p>
<p>The idea that a short, simple intervention could have such seemingly dramatic effects will likely raise the eyebrows of more sceptical readers. Successful replication attempts with larger samples and diverse participants may help alleviate these doubts. Future research could also look into whether the multiple identities intervention would have greater benefits for individuals with more diverse social roles and experiences (for children raised in multicultural or multi-racial homes, for instance), and whether reflecting on social roles that one perceives negatively would still be beneficial.</p>
<p>“Our discovery suggests that anyone–regardless of their racial group or other social identification–may benefit from a multifaceted mindset,” the researchers said. “Something as simple as thinking about one’s identity from multiple angles could increase open-mindedness in a society that is becoming increasingly diverse.”</p>
<p>—<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">Thinking about multiple identities boosts children’s flexible thinking</a></p>
<p>*The answer is by emptying the bowl, inverting it and using it as a step to stand on and reach higher.</p>

<p>Loneliness <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">is a “disease”</a>, associated with an increased risk of death equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Strides have been made in understanding what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/">form of loneliness</a> is damaging<i> </i>(a lack of<i> close</i> relationships with other people, rather than a lack of relationships per se), but ways to tackle loneliness are badly needed. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/">new study</a>, available as a preprint on PsyArXiv, reveals a way in which loneliness seems to be maintained and, therefore, a potential route to an intervention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37348"></span></p>
<p>A popular model of loneliness holds that it is maintained by abnormal processing of the social signals – such as smiles and eye contact – that underlie positive social interactions. One consequence of this abnormal processing could be a failure to automatically mimic other people’s facial expressions – a phenomenon that occurs naturally during most social interactions. To investigate for the first time whether this is the case, Andrew Arnold and Piotr Winkielman at the University of California, San Diego conducted a small, preliminary study on 35 student volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students first completed three scales that measured their loneliness, depression and personality. Based on the loneliness results, they were classed as either lonely or not lonely. Next they had electrodes attached to two pairs of their own facial muscles important for generating emotional expressions – regions of the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles in the cheeks, and also the corrugator supercilii (frowning) muscles in the brow. They were then shown video clips of men and women making facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scales that they were given to complete showed that the lonely and non-lonely students were equally good at distinguishing between facial expressions, and there were no group differences in the strength of “negative emotion” ratings to anger, fear and sadness or “positive” ratings to joy. So the lonely people could recognise and understand emotional expressions just as well as the non-lonely group. However, there were important differences in how their <i>own</i> faces responded spontaneously to the video clips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When members of both groups saw videos of people displaying anger, for example, their own brows moved to automatically mimic this expression. But when the expression in the video was of joy, only the “non-lonely” group automatically smiled in response. The participants’ scores on depression and on extraversion bore no relation to this finding. It was loneliness that made the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers checked that the lonely group could deliberately mimic smiles, as well as frowns (which they could). They also found that the lonely group smiled automatically while viewing “non-social” positive images (such as nature scenes) that also made the other group smile. These images didn’t include people (or if they did, their facial expressions weren’t obvious.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that a failure to mimic other people’s smiles automatically could be playing a role in loneliness. A failure to mimic a smile might send an antisocial signal to others, the researchers note, undermining social connections, and leading to social <i>dis</i>connect. “Indeed, this could be one behavioural mechanism that maintains chronic loneliness,” they add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is a small study, and it can’t speak to the causal direction: does loneliness lead to a problem with smile mimicry or is it the other way around? But it does suggest a new target for addressing loneliness, and for further research into the role it might potentially play in real-world encounters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Given the serious problem of loneliness in society and its danger to health, more research on how it presents in everyday social interactions is useful for greater understanding of and treatment of the condition, ourselves and each other,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life <em>in </em>those years?</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?</h2>
<p>“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.</p>
<p>The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367"><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.</p>
<p>“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.</p>
<p>As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.</p>
<h2>The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease</h2>
<p>Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another longevity project, the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.</p>
<p>Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.</p>
<h2>Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.</h2>
<p>Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live <em>with</em> illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.</p>
<p>It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.</p>
<p>Regardless of their age, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289">research</a> indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?</h2>
<p>In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.</p>
<p>Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p>The older you get the happier you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159"><em>The emotion paradox in the aging brain</em></a>, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.</p>
<blockquote><p>When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why media outlets report scientifically misleading information. But one key site at which this sort of misunderstanding takes root is in the press releases that universities issue when one of their researchers has published something that has a chance of garnering some attention. A <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1324-7">new open-access study in BMC Medicine</a> attempts to change this by intervening in the process directly.</p>
<p><span id="more-37345"></span></p>
<p>Press releases are often misleading in many different ways, but a common flaw is their <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/21/how-much-are-readers-misled-by-headlines-that-imply-correlational-findings-are-causal/">tendency to confuse causal and correlational claims</a>. That is, an observational study will find that (to take a hypothetical), the more wine people drink, the more likely they are to be diagnosed with cancer over a given period. A study like this, reported accurately, doesn’t show that drinking wine <i>causes</i> cancer – it shows that wine consumption is <i>associated with </i>cancer diagnoses. It could be some other factor or factors is/are responsible for the link, like maybe people who drink more wine engage in other behaviours that <i>themselves</i> increase the risk of cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Experimental studies, on the other hand, allow for the more confident drawing of causal inferences. If (again hypothetically) you took two otherwise equivalent groups, assigned one to make no lifestyle changes other than beginning to drink more wine, and then tracked differences in long-term cancer diagnoses, it’s more likely any observed group differences were caused by the experimental intervention.</p>
<p>The way that health press releases often present purely correlational evidence as though it is causal is, to an extent, understandable: “Wine Causes Cancer” is more eye-catching than “Researchers Uncover A Correlation Between Wine Consumption And Cancer That May Or May Not Be Causal.” And because journalists often write stories based entirely on press releases, the end result is that news coverage often lacks nuance.</p>
<p>For the new research, a team of psychologists led by Rachel Adams at Cardiff University and including her colleague Christopher Chambers, the author of “The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology: A Manifesto for Reforming the Culture of Scientific Practice”, asked a bunch of university press offices to participate. The press offices sent the team hundreds of their biomedical and health-related press releases before they went out to the public, and Chambers and his colleagues randomly assigned them to different conditions: some they didn’t touch regardless of their contents or accuracy (the control group), whereas for the others they proposed edits that “aligned” the press release’s headline and content with the nature of the evidence (with experimental evidence allowing for stronger causal claims, and purely correlational evidence presented with cautious language). Then they watched the press releases go into the wild, evaluating how often their more careful approach was carried over into any ensuing national and international press stories – and whether the toned down releases led to less media coverage.</p>
<p>The most important takeaways are that news headlines were more accurate when they were written off more accurate press releases (which shows that journalists really are relying heavily on press releases rather than reading the studies themselves). And as judged by the amount of media coverage each press release generated, there was “no evidence of reduced news uptake for press releases whose headlines and main claims aligned to evidence.” Now, press releases should be accurate for accuracy’s own sake, but this does offer some evidence that honest press-release writers won’t be punished, in terms of reduced media coverage, by doing the right thing. This suggests, as Chambers and his team write in their abstract, that “[c]autious claims and explicit caveats about correlational findings may penetrate into news without harming news interest.”</p>
<p>As the research team further point out, what this study can’t answer is the actual effect of misleading versus appropriately hedged media coverage on news consumers themselves – that is, will their behaviour change on the basis of whether or not they are reading accurate health coverage? That’s a question for future research.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating and important to conduct a study like this on press releases related to psychological findings – another area where it’s been fairly standard <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/08/tetris-related-science-reporting-failure.html">for a while</a> for weak or conflicting findings to be presented in a much stronger, more attention-getting manner in press releases, potentially causing harm to readers.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<h2>When does old age begin?</h2>
<p>We can’t seem to make up our minds, and the older we get, the further we move the goalposts marking the last season of our lives.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/06/29/growing-old-in-america-expectations-vs-reality/">2009 survey</a> of Americans asked participants when they believed someone grew ‘old’.</p>
<p>Young folks in their twenties believed said old age began at 60. Those under 50 put the threshold closer to 70, whereas those 65 and above said that the average person does not become old until turning 74.</p>
<p>Getting old wasn’t nearly as bad as people think it will be. Nor was it quite as good.</p>
<p>On the downside, one in four adults ages 65 surveyed reported memory loss. One in five had a serious illness, are no longer sexually active, or often feel sad or depressed, lonely or have trouble paying bills. One in ten felt like a burden.</p>
<p>On the upside, the same group said they have more time for hobbies, travel, volunteer work, and more financial security. Of all the good things about getting old, the best by far, according to older adults, is being able to spend more time with family members.</p>
<h2>“Am I Old? Certainly not!”</h2>
<p>One of my boys said to me recently he couldn’t imagine me as a little girl and how did it feel to finally be “old”. I told him I feel the same now as I did when I was 10.</p>
<p>“Am I Old? Certainly not!” This was the answer survey respondents gave too.</p>
<p>In fact, the older they got, the younger they said they feel. About half of those under 30 said they felt their age. But those who were 75 and older? Just 35% say they feel “old”.</p>
<p>It seems we remain on intimate terms with our much younger selves — I sometimes wonder how ten-year old me suddenly became forty-three?</p>
<h2>We enter the end of our lifespan with our past woven intimately into our biology.</h2>
<p>From birth, our neural architecture is shaped by life’s ups and downs, the decisions we made, the places where we lived, worked and learned, the meaning we’ve derived, and who we loved, gave life to, and travelled with through time. How we spend our early years will determine how we age.</p>
<p>More and more of us are living to into old age, and there has never been a better time in which to do so. Our large clever human brains have bequeathed us with modern medicine and tools with which we manage our reproductive health, avoid maternal and neonatal death, vaccinate against disease, prevent pain, treat infection and some cancers, and perform surgery if required.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, women lived barely long enough to see out their 50s. A baby girl born today can expect to live to see out the first decades of the 22<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the secrets of exceptional longevity</h2>
<p>On February 21, 1875, one year before the Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, cinema, and on a trip to Paris saw the Eiffel tower being built. When she was 13, Jeanne met Vincent Van Gogh; although apparently, she was less than impressed saying he was ”…very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick…”.</p>
<p>In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf, and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and “alert as a hummingbird” till the end. The French called her “la doyenne de l’humanitè” (the elder of humankind) and she still holds <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11520-2_16">the record</a> for the world’s longest ever living human (although this has been recently <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/">challenged</a>).</p>
<p>In April 2017, the latest longevity record holder, Emma Martina Luigia Morano of Vercelli, Italy, died aged 117. Born in November 1899, Morano was the last known living person who was born in the 1800s. According to the Guinness Book of Records, Morano followed the same extraordinary diet for around 90 years: three eggs per day (two raw, one cooked), fresh Italian pasta, and a dish of raw meat. The current longevity crown belongs to Polish Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal, who celebrated his 113th birthday in September 2017.</p>
<h2>Once rare as diamonds, the oldest of the old are the fastest growing sector of our global population.</h2>
<p>If you were born in 1900, the odds of living till age 100 were less than 1 in a million, and few people lived long enough see out the 1950s. For girls born into wealthy countries today, the odds of blowing out 100 candles on a cake are roughly 1 in 50.</p>
<p>Israel Kristal claims he doesn’t know the secret of his long life.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that everything is determined from above and we shall never know the reasons why. There have been smarter, stronger and better-looking men then me who are no longer alive. All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked her secrets, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that … I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes. Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hard work, raw eggs, biking, and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wait. For death and journalists.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Blue Zones lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>In another longevity project, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner together Professor Michel Poulain famously described five ‘<a href="https://www.bluezones.com/">Blue Zones</a>’ around the globe where the residents live to exceptional old age. Despite being very different parts of the world, there are commonalities to the resident’s lifestyles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their longevity has nothing to do with brute discipline, diets, exercise programs or supplements… In Blue Zones areas around the world, longevity happens to people. It’s the result of the right environment that constantly nudges them into moving more, eating more plants and beans while eating less meat and sugar, socializing with the right people and living out their values. It’s that simple, really.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Residents of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, prioritise friendship and family, and they almost never work extra hours if it means they have to forego a good party. They also foster ‘plan de vida’ or ‘a reason to live’.</li>
<li>In Loma Linda, California, the strong sense of purpose, day of rest, no-smoking policy, and healthy diet practices of the local Seventh Day Adventist community has rubbed off on the health of the whole town.</li>
<li>Residents of the mountainous villages of Sardinia, Italy and the Greek island of Ikaria, nap, fast, grow their own food, and drink wine daily with friends. It’s thought the clean air, warm breezes and rugged terrain of the Mediterranean islands draw locals outdoors to move naturally.</li>
<li>The residents of the Japanese islands of Okinawa, home to the world’s longest living women, are dedicated to family. Okinawans practice ‘Hara hachi bu’, a reminder to stop eating when they’re 80% full, ‘Ikigai’, which roughly translates to “Why I wake up in the morning,” and form ‘Moais’, groups of five friends that remain committed to each other for live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buettner has distilled the lifestyle practices of Blue Zones into lessons for longevity. As he says, to make it to 100 you may have to “win the genetic lottery”, but the average person’s life expectancy can be increased by moving move, prioritising friends, family and social gatherings, eating less, drinking wine, and fostering a sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Sydney Centenarian Study lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>Due to the rarity of extremely old folks, the <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/research-projects/sydney-centenarian-study">Sydney Centenarian Study</a> has partnered with a consortium of centenarian research teams from around the globe to pool their resources and data to enable more powerful conclusions to be drawn. Their data support the Blue Zones observations.</p>
<p>Charlene Levitan, who once headed up the Sydney Centenarian Study says,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is emerging from the global research is that around 30% of longevity is contributed by genetics. The remaining 70% is to do with our lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, exercise, and remaining socially integrated.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest themes to emerge is related to the personality traits of resilience, adaptability and optimism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of our centenarians will report optimism as a life-long personality characteristic.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have healthy vision, there will be a specific region of your brain (in the visual cortex) that responds most strongly whenever you look at faces, and similar regions that are especially responsive to the sight of words or natural scenes. What’s more, in any two people, these face, word and scene regions are located in pretty much the same spot in the brain. However, there is not a specific region for every possible category of visible stimulus – there are no “car” or “shoe” regions, for example (at least, not that have been identified to date). Is that because childhood experience is critical for training the visual cortex – we spend a lot of time looking at faces, say, but not cars? And, if so, in theory, could a lot of childhood time spent looking at a different type of object generate its own dedicated, individual category region?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The answer is “yes”, at least according to an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8">ingenious study</a>, published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour, </i>of people who played a Pokémon game for years of their childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37328"></span></p>
<p>Jesse Gomez led the new study while a graduate student at Stanford University. He was looking for a way to test whether there’s a critical developmental window for the formation of dedicated category regions in the human visual cortex, just as there is in macaque monkeys. He needed a kind of visual stimulus that some adults had been exposed to intensively in childhood but others had not. He thought of how, from about the age of six, he, like many other kids he knew, used to spend countless hours playing a game on his Nintendo Game Boy called Pokémon Red and Blue. It involved identifying hundreds of different Pokémon characters, which look a bit like animals or mythical beasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez realised that if he could find other people who had also started playing the game intensively at about the same age, using the same device, he could explore whether this had influenced the organisation of their visual cortex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He managed to recruit 11 such adults (including himself), and scanned their brains while they were shown images of Pokémon characters, as well as other things, such as faces, corridors and cartoons. Gomez and his colleagues found that within the visual cortex (in the ventral temporal region) of the Pokémon experts, there was a discrete area that was most active when looking at the Pokémon characters. There was no such region in a control group of non-players.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other work has found that the brains of people who become experts at recognising a type of object (like cars) as an adult respond differently to those objects than the brains of novices. But these differences are not in the visual cortex; they’re more often in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attention and decision-making rather than basic visual processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on the work showing the plasticity of the visual cortex in young macaques, “the current finding of a Pokémon-preferring brain region really drives home just how amazing the plasticity of our developing visual system is,” write Daniel Janini and Talia Konkle of Harvard University in a news comment on the paper, published in the same issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez and his colleagues also found that – as with face-processing or word-processing regions – the “Pokemon region” shared a similar location in all of the experts’ brains. They think that the physical size of an object’s image on the retina is important in determining where, in the brain, the category region forms. The image size of a Pokémon character viewed on an old Game Boy screen by children is consistently smaller than that of someone’s face – and a lot smaller than that of a landscape, for instance – which could have a lasting effect on the way visual representations are handled in the adult brain, the researchers think.</p>
<p>As well as being fascinating, the study has potentially important practical implications. “Our data raise the possibility that if people do not share common visual experiences of a stimulus during childhood, either from disease, as is the case in cataracts, or cultural differences in viewing patterns, then an atypical or unique representation of that stimulus may result in adulthood, which has important implications for learning disabilities and social disabilities,” the researchers write. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Consider autism, for example, which is associated with difficulties recognising faces and an aversion to eye contact. If kids with autism grow up looking at faces differently from how most children do, perhaps this explains the <a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/ffa-fusiform-facial-area-neurons-autism-recognition/">observed deficits</a> in the function of the face-sensitive region of their visual cortex, and in turn this could contribute to the social difficulties that autistic children experience. If this account is correct, then finding out how long the window of visual cortical plasticity lasts will be critical for designing effective interventions for autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<h4>How brains learn diseases, and their cures</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/1*slNjzwmTKuHo03_bW86V-Q.png" /></figure><p>My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.</p><p>Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are <em>cells</em>, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.</p><p>Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-to-unlearn-a-disease">epileptic patients report</a> that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-dostoevsky-epilepsy-was-a-matter-of-both-life-and-literature">aura</a>’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.</p><p>SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012372">Rivlin et al., 2013</a>). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517513/">Giaccia, Simon, &amp; Johnson, 2004</a>). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705794">Kemp &amp; Peers, 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728482/">Nei, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821532/">Richerson, 2010</a>). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897710">P-Codrea, et al., 2005</a>), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468748">Takano et al., 2007</a>). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.</p><p>The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one <em>learned</em> by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.</p><p>The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol><li>Interestingly, SUDEP is more prevalent among males, and males tend to be more sensitive to hypoxia, suffering worse outcomes. This has been found true both in clinical studies and in studies involving multiple animal models (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474588">Hill &amp; Fitch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542909">Mayoral, Omar, &amp; Penn, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889641">Mirza, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149081">Pérez-Crespo et al., 2005</a>). This sexual dimorphism may be due, in part, to the gene G6PD, an X-linked gene related to oxidative stress, which has been implicated in hypoxia-induced damage (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063801">Chettimada et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225644">Gao, L., et al., 2004</a>). It’s also worth noting that in a rodent model, sleep apnea-induced plasticity of the breathing circuit was normalized with antioxidant treatment, which may similarly show a protective effect in high SUDEP risk patients. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress may play an important role in detecting and preventing SUDEP.</li><li>Some researchers believe that SUDEP is related to another medical mystery, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the best known risk factors for SIDS is prenatal nicotine exposure, and nicotine exposure is known to alter receptor expression in oxygen-sensing neural circuits; therefore both diseases may result from plasticity of the brain areas responsible for controlling breathing.</li><li>SUDEP has also been associated with a variety of genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as well as several anti-convulsive drugs that also make patients prone to arrhythmias (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372310">Klassen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989471/">Glasscock, 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>). However, genes do not deterministically dictate SUDEP risk. Given that genetic tests are costly, and only suggestive of susceptibility, a functional measurement such as apnea would likely be a more effective biomarker.</li></ol><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ced1cb1b3545" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/thoughts-on-a-medical-mystery-ced1cb1b3545">Thoughts on a medical mystery</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You should take just under two-and-a-half minutes to finish reading this blog post. That’s going by the findings of a new review, which has looked at almost 200 studies of reading rates published over the past century to come up with an overall estimate for how quickly we read. And it turns out that that rate is considerably slower than commonly thought.</p>
<p>Of the various estimates of average reading speed bandied around over the years, one of the most commonly cited is 300 words per minute (wpm). However, a number of findings of slower reading rates challenge that statistic, notes Marc Brysbaert from Ghent University in Belgium in his new paper <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/">released as a preprint on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37321"></span></p>
<p>Brysbaert searched for all studies measuring reading rates in participants aged between 17 and 60 and in languages that use the Latin alphabet. The exact nature of the studies varied a lot: for example, in some, participants had to read a long passage before answering multiple choice questions about the text, while in others they read single sentences while their eye movements were measured. But Brysbaert included only those studies in which participants read for fun or comprehension, and excluded others that require memorization or other challenges. Altogether, he found 190 suitable studies conducted between 1901 and 2019, collectively involving 17,887 participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The average reading rate across all these studies turned out to be just 238 wpm – much slower than the popular 300 wpm estimate. However, there was quite a lot of variability between studies, particularly those that used very short passages, where the slowest rate was just over 100 wpm and the fastest nearly 400 wpm. With longer texts, the rates fell more closely around the average, suggesting that longer reading tasks might be a more reliable measure.</p>
<p>Although the number of studies involving non-English languages was too small to draw any firm conclusions, there seemed to be a hint of differences between languages. For example, reading rate in the five Spanish studies was considerably faster than the average, at 278 wpm, while the average rate for the 144 English-only studies was 236 wpm. And while the meta-analysis only included participants under the age of 60, Brysbaert notes that other studies have found that reading rate declines in older age groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Knowing that reading rates are closer to 240 than 300 wpm might seem fairly inconsequential. But it does have real-world implications. These kinds of thresholds are used by educators to determine whether someone is a slow reader and in need of remedial help – so honing in on a precise number is important. “Setting the target reading rate at 300 wpm is unrealistic for the majority of people and likely to result in disappointment of what can be achieved,” writes Brysbaert.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis of past reading-rate estimates is arguably the most interesting part of the new preprint – but in fact the manuscript encompasses a lot more. If you want to find out more about the long history of reading research<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or what the fastest possible reading speed is, go and have a look at the paper. But set aside some time: at more than 19,000 words long, it will take you about 80 minutes to get through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Picture in your mind a futuristic, technologically enhanced human. Perhaps you imagined them with a subcutaneous device in their arm for phone calls and browsing the internet. Maybe they are wearing smart glasses for augmented reality. What I’d wager you didn’t think of is the presence of an artificial sixth digit attached to each hand. However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10306-w">a breakthrough open-access study in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> – the first to study the physiology and sensorimotor mechanics of polydactyly volunteers (people born with extra fingers) – shows the feasibility and practical advantages that would be gained from such an extra appendage. The results also have implications for the medical treatment of polydactyl people, who often have their extra finger removed at birth on the presumption that it will be of no benefit to them.</p>
<p><span id="more-37317"></span></p>
<p>Carsten Mehring and his colleagues conducted various tests with two polydactyly volunteers, a 17-year-old boy and his mother, both born with an extra fully formed finger between their thumb and index finger (known as preaxial polydactyly). The researchers note that polydactyly is “not rare”, with an incidence of around 0.2 per cent in the population. However, fully formed preaxial polydactyly is a rarer subset of that group.</p>
<p>Using MRI of the volunteers’ hands, the researchers established that the extra finger has a saddle joint, similar to a typical thumb, and that it is innervated by its own dedicated nerves. Further tests established that the volunteers had independent control of their extra finger and that they were able to use it to perform a pinch grip with each of their other fingers.</p>
<p>An MRI of the volunteers’ brains further showed that the extra finger was represented in the brain independently of the other fingers. Another test, that involved concealing the extra finger and asking the volunteers’ to identify landmarks on it, showed that they had an accurate mental representation of their extra digit.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers used video motion capture to observe the volunteers manipulating various objects. This showed that the volunteers engaged in a “rich ensemble of movement patterns” and that they frequently used their extra finger in coordination with both their thumb and index finger (it was not simply used as a substitute for these digits). “Taken together these results demonstrate that the movements of the six fingers of our two subjects had increased complexity relative to common five-fingered hands,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>But do these extra movement capabilities provide any functional advantage? Mehring and his team devised a video game that required coordinating key presses to respond to six boxes oscillating progressively faster up and down onscreen. A different key press was required to respond to each of the six boxes, so people with normal five-fingered hands would need two hands to succeed at the task, the researchers note. Critically, the polydactyl volunteers were able to achieve the same impressive game performance with one hand as with two.</p>
<p>Neuroscience and psychology have studied extensively the profound neural consequences for humans of losing a limb or other appendage, including documenting the pain caused by the phantom limb effect (usually explained as due to reorganisation of the brain’s representation of missing part). However, this new study represents the first neuroscientific exploration of having an extra body part, finding “… that the human nervous system is able to develop, embody and control multiple extra degrees of freedom and integrate them into coordinated movements with the other limbs, without any apparent deficits or conflicts in the sensorimotor or mental representations.”</p>
<p>This has immediate implications for the medical response to polydactyl, suggesting the need to “…thoroughly evaluate the functionality of [the extra digit] in polydactyl infants before deciding whether to remove it.” Also, from a cyborg perspective, the results “…suggest that it may be of value to augment normal five-fingered hands with an artificial supernumerary finger,” the researchers said. In fact this new research paves the wave for an entire new research endeavor. “Polydactyl individuals with functional [extra fingers] offer a unique opportunity to investigate the neural control of supernumerary limbs, analyse internal representations of body and the limits of sensorimotor capabilities in humans.”</p>

Now that final Plan S guidelines were released, the chemists publish this Open Letter expressing their worry about a possible dystopian OA future.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/602950398/0/oupblogpsychology/">When narcolepsy makes you more creative</a></h4>

<p>At night, the surrealist poet Saint-Pol-Roux used to hang a sign on his bedroom’s door that read: “Do not disturb: poet at work.” Indeed, may sleep increase our creativity? The link between creativity and sleep has been a topic of intense speculation, mainly based on anecdotal reports of artistic and scientific discoveries people have made while dreaming. Dmitri Mendeleev supposedly came up with the arrangement that became the periodic table while asleep. Yet, scientific proof of such a relationship remains scarce. To investigate the long-term effect of sleep on creativity, clinicians and scientists from Sorbonne University, Paris, France, and Bologna University, Italy, called upon experts of sleep and dreams: patients with narcolepsy.</p><p>Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder characterised by uncontrolled sleep attacks. These naps are special, as they often start immediately with a specific sleep stage named rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas healthy subjects need to sleep for roughly one hour before entering REM sleep. Therefore, patients with narcolepsy have a swift access to REM sleep, a stage associated with robust dreaming activity. They also present many symptoms showing that the boundary between wakefulness and REM sleep is blurry. For example, most narcolepsy patients are lucid dreamers, meaning that they are conscious of dreaming while dreaming, to the point of sometimes having control over their dreams. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130">It has also been shown that naps containing REM sleep are followed by a period of increased mental flexibility, in turn favouring problem solving</a>. Given their life-long privileged access to REM sleep and dreams, may patients with narcolepsy have developed over time higher creative abilities than average?</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awz137">To answer this question, the authors compared the creative abilities of patients with narcolepsy with healthy subjects</a>. Defining and measuring creativity is not an easy task. In this research field, creativity is commonly defined as the ability to produce work that is both original and adapted to constraints. In order to obtain a picture of creativity as detailed and complete as possible, the authors asked participants to complete various tasks.</p><p>First, 185 patients with narcolepsy and 126 healthy subjects completed two questionnaires on creativity. The first questionnaire explores your creative profile and score, through 57 questions, and concludes whether one is innovative, imaginative, or a researcher.  Then, in the second questionnaire subjects report creative achievements (from being a complete beginner to being a national star) in various domains of arts and sciences, including writing, theatre/film, humour, inventions, or culinary arts. The results of these two questionnaires provide a subjective measure of creativity. Next, researchers tested the creative performances of 30 patients with narcolepsy and 30 healthy subjects during a face-to-face two-hour long test of creativity, named the Evaluation of Creative Potential. The divergent-exploratory thinking, a thought process used to generate creative ideas, was tested by finding the greatest number of solutions to a problem (e.g., “Invent the maximum of shapes using two triangles”). The convergent-integrative thinking, the ability to give the correct answer to questions that do not require significant creativity, was tested by combing several elements into a coherent pattern (e.g., drawings a scene based on seven shapes, or writing a story that includes an animal, an old man, the suburb and three cars).</p><p>Globally, subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher creative scores than the healthy subjects, for both the subjective and the objective measures, and in all forms of creative profiles. Most symptoms of narcolepsy (sleepiness, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, but not treatments) were also associated with higher scores of creativity.</p><p>This increased creativity may be a result of more frequent opportunities for patients with narcolepsy to incubate ideas during daytime naps (with REM sleep). Moreover, the high dream recall frequency observed in narcolepsy may also provide them with a high pool of inspiring new ideas.</p><p>For the first time, an increased creativity is demonstrated in subjects with narcolepsy, providing a silver lining to this disastrous disease. These young adults are often considered lazy, but it appears their proficient lucid dreaming and creative abilities may help researchers better understand the role of dreaming in everyone’s life.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Grayscale photo of sleeping woman lying on bed” by Kinga Cichewicz.

AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a><span style="color: black;"> – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Heeded and acted upon?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11">rumour on Twitter</a><span style="color: black;"> is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (</span><span><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge">GLOALL</a><span style="color: black;">). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  </span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.</span><br /><a name="more"></a><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span><a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm">BBB definition</a></span><span>” of open access.

Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions.

In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina.

However, in the process of change control needs to be transferred to academia – to academic institutions, to universities, to academic associations, and to other stakeholders whose focus is on the development of science rather than promoting private commercial interests.

                <h4><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html">Why did Riksbankens Jubileumsfond decide to leave cOAlition S?</a></h4>

<span>Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>Plan S</span></a><span>. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.</span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Simeon87 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG">CC BY-SA</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><br /><span></span><span>Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home">a petition</a> of protest being launched. <span>  </span></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/">revised guidelines</a> last week (31st May). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “</span><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s"><span>welcomed</span></a><span>” them, as </span><a href="http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/"><span>have</span></a><span> open access advocates.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were </span><a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/"><span>10 funders</span></a><span>; today there are still only </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>19</span></a><span>. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the </span><a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php"><span>two largest producers of research papers in the world</span></a><span> – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.</span><br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en"><span>RJ</span></a><span>) to leave the coalition. RJ</span><span>’</span><span>s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>How, when and why did RJ leave?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 6<sup>th</sup> March RJ published </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an open letter</span></a><span> addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Leave or remain?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day (7<sup>th</sup> March) RJ posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20"><span>tweet</span></a><span> saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/"><span>a note</span></a><span> on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (</span><span>May 28</span><sup>th</sup><span>) RJ </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that it had left the coalition.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Confusingly, although the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6<sup>th</sup>, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7<sup>th</sup> March.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin">Marika Hedin</a>. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1<sup>st</sup> February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “</span><span>No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Evolved</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6<sup>th</sup>letter. It is also</span><span> not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">10 Plan S Principles</a><span>– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More puzzling perhaps, the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>When I </span><span>asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and </span><a href="https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/"><span>Head of Open Research</span></a><span>at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31<sup>st</sup> May).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? </span><span>“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until <i>after</i> the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;A. She replied, “</span><span>Thank you, but I have no further comments.</span><span>After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Openness and transparency</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm. And this change appears to date from<a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html"> the point at which funders began to take up the cause</a> and started introducing ever more oppressive OA mandates. Increasingly, decisions are taken behind closed doors and new rules are imposed on unwilling and hapless researchers.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And is there not a hint of hypocrisy here? Principle 5 of Plan S insists that publishers must be transparent about their pricing and processes, including their </span><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/journal-transparency-rules-help-scholars-pick-where-publish"><span>editorial policies, their decision-making, their acceptance rates and their review times</span></a><span>. Researchers, meanwhile, face ever more bureaucratic scrutiny in order to ensure compliance and are threatened with sanctions if they fail to comply.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Should we not expect cOAlition S members to live by the same rules of responsibility and transparency that they seek to force on publishers and researchers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Is it not therefore incumbent on RJ to explain in more detail what it thought it was signing up to, why it signed up if it did not understand the implications of doing so, and why it subsequently chose to leave, despite apparently having had its demands met – that is, both the timetable and the implementation of Plan S were adjusted to become more flexible? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Should we not also expect decisions about open access to be decided in a democratic and open manner? How, for instance, did signatory funders make their decisions about joining Plan S and how open to scrutiny is that decision-making process?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 27<sup>th</sup> February I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1100679321868554240"><span>invited</span></a><span> all members of cOAlition S to send me a link to, or copy of, the minutes of the meetings of the board (or similar) where it was agreed to join the coalition. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Only three funders responded and not one pointed me to any minutes. Of those who responed, two were private funders – the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation – and one a public funder, Formas. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In responding for Wellcome, Kiley <a href="https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1100168492848951296">said</a> that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been taken by the </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/executive-leadership-team"><span>Executive Leadership Team</span></a><span>. This might seem to suggest that the </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/governance/board-governors"><span>Wellcome Board</span></a><span> (which has ultimate responsibility for Wellcome’s activities) had not been consulted. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Formas </span><a href="https://twitter.com/pressformas/status/1111600447628955648"><span>replied</span></a><span> that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been made by the Director General, with no mention of the Formas </span><a href="https://formas.se/om-formas/sa-styrs-formas/forskarradet.html#Innehall"><span>Scientific Council</span></a><span> having been asked to give approval.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And the minutes of the Board meetings of the Research Council of Norway posted on the Web suggested that the funder did not discuss Plan S until three months after it had signed up. (The minutes of the meeting appear now to have been </span><a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Saklister_og_referater/1195592857784"><span>taken down</span></a><span>). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Apart from the embarrassment of signing up to an initiative like Plan S only to have the decision later overturned by the Board, this kind of executive power grab is out of tune with the open, transparent and democratic principles that the OA movement was built on. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In its letter of March 6<sup>th</sup> RJ makes </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an important point</span></a><span>: it says that by seeking to force Plan S on researchers without adequate consultation the <i>modus operandi</i> of Plan S, “has succeeded to turn researchers who have been in favour of Open Science and Robert Merton’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms"><span>CUDOS principles</span></a><span> against these positions. This is an unfortunate development.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>That perhaps is the key issue: forcing oppressive OA mandates on researchers may turn out to be counterproductive. Perhaps that is the real reason why RJ left cOAlition S: the failure to get researcher buy-in <i>before </i>announcing the initiative. But then why did RJ’s CEO sign up in the first place? Why did RJ not express concern until six months later? And why is it not willing to talk openly and publicly about what happened? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>After all, if RJ’s concerns about the dangers of seeking to force open access on researchers are valid then the issue is of wider significance than Plan S alone. It is of relevance to the very future of open access and how it is (or is not) achieved. </span></div><br />

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</a></h4>

<p>There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">critique of the neural coding metaphor</a>, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a <em>primary</em> representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a <em>secondary</em> representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/">Mark Bickhard</a>.</p>
<p>The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">subjective physics</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural coding essay</a>, and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">in my response to commentaries</a> (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/">problematic aspects</a> with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.</p>
<p>With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons <em>is</em> the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.</p>

<p>Germany’s Max Planck Society, the research powerhouse that includes the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, has been ranked as the top biomedical nonprofit organization in the world by Nature Index. <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/supplements/nature-index-2019-biomedical-sciences/tables/npo-ngo">The rankings</a> examine prominent research institutions and scientists across the world whose publications profoundly impact biomedical research. In addition to taking the top spot among nonprofit/NGO institutions, the Max Planck Society ranked fifth overall when compared to all research organizations, including major universities and government health agencies.</p>
<p>“The Max Planck Society’s unique ‘science-first’ core values create an environment for unparalleled research excellence. We are proud to be a part of the leading nonprofit research organization in the world, and to represent the Max Planck Society in the United States,” said David Fitzpatrick, CEO and Scientific Director of the Max Planck Florida Institute.</p>
<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is the only Max Planck Institute in North America. Besides the one in Jupiter, Florida, the Max Planck Society operates another 83 institutes, most of them in Germany, one in Luxemburg, two in Italy, and one in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1948, 18 Nobel laureates have emerged from the ranks of its scientists. As its first U.S. institution, MPFI brings together exceptional neuroscientists from around the world to answer fundamental questions about brain function and development and to advance new technologies that make groundbreaking scientific discoveries possible. Their research is shared publicly with scholars, universities and other organizations around the globe, providing the necessary foundation of knowledge to develop treatments and cures for brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<h2>Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</li>
<li>Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</li>
<li>Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.</p>
<p>Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions girls experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A novel optimization algorithm, called the Magnetic Optimization Algorithms (MOAs), is proposed in this paper which is inspired by the principles of magnetic field theory. In MOA, the possible solutions are some magnetic particles scattered in the search space. In this respect, each magnetic particle has a measure of mass and magnetic field according to its fitness. In this scheme, the fitter magnetic particles are more massive, with stronger magnetic field. In terms of interaction, these particles are located in a structured population and apply a long range force of attraction to their neighbors. Ten different structures are proposed for the algorithm and the structure that offers the best performance is found. Also, to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm, several operators are proposed: a repulsive short-range force, an explosion operator, a combination of short-range force and explosion operator and a crossover interaction between the neighboring particles. In order to test the proposed algorithm and the proposed operators, the algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms on 21 numerical benchmark functions. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the existing algorithms.</p>

O. and Silverman B.W, 2002)</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has seen rapid development over the last two decades. FDA refers to a collection of methods for analysing data over a curve, surface or continuum. It is very much involved with computational statistics. FDA has been applied to quite broadly in medicine, business and engineering.</p>
<p>In this talk, Yi will introduce the basic idea of FDA using a case study presented in the paper: zooming in on human growth.</p>
<p>“Human growth is not at all the simple process that one might imagine at first sight… Collecting records is time-consuming and expensive, because children have to be measured accurately and tracked for a long period of their lives.</p>
<p>[We] consider how to make this sort of record into a useful functional datum to incorporate into further analyses. A smooth curve drawn through the points is commonly called a growth curve, but growth is actually the rate of increase of the height of the child. In children this is necessarily positive… [We] develop a monotone smoothing method that takes this sort of consideration into account and yields a functional datum that picks out important stages in a child’s growth."</p>

<p>Long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses plays a principal role in learning in the cerebellum, which acts as a supervised learning machine. Recent experiments demonstrate various forms of synaptic plasticity at different sites within the cerebellum. In this article, we take into consideration synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses as well as at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and propose that the cerebellar cortex performs reinforcement learning, another form of learning that is more capable than supervised learning. We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.</p>

<h2>Stress is an inevitable part of life.</h2>
<p>We feel ‘stressed’ when real or imagined pressures exceed our perceived ability to cope. If things all feel ‘too much’, we experience the sensations of ‘stress’.</p>
<p>But feeling stress is not always a bad thing. When stress is short-term and manageable, it motivates and facilitates learning and change. Stress only becomes toxic when it’s excessive or long-lasting.</p>
<p>Long-term low level ‘hum’ of stress or short-term excessive stress can increase our risk of developing serious medical conditions such as high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>To enable the nuanced and very human responses to the diverse challenges that might come your way, the brain produces a highly coordinated and complex stress-response.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Brain Healthy and Happy?</h2>
<p>The health and happiness of our brain are our influenced by multiple interacting factors including biology, the world around us, and our thoughts, feelings and mindset.</p>
<p>One useful way to understand how our brain is influenced by so many complex factors is using the <strong>Bottom-Up, Outside-In,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Top-Down Model of Brain Health.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It’s also a useful framework to find discover different ways to buffer stress. <img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-5906" height="684" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NSA_BottomUpOutsideInTopDown-1024x778.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<li><strong>Bottom-Up</strong> elements are the biological or physiological determinants of brain health and include genes, hormones, the immune system, nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices.</li>
<li><strong>Outside-In</strong> elements include social and environmental factors, stress, life events, education, current circumstances, and family background.</li>

<p>Using the Bottom-Up Outside-In Top-Down model, here are six practical strategies that allow you to find peace of mind amidst your challenges.</p>
<h2>Bottom-Up Approach: Change your biology</h2>
<h3>1. Get a good night sleep and indulge in a nap</h3>
<p>Sleep is the cornerstone of good brain health. While we sleep, the brain consolidates memories and goes through an amazing <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/research/research-impact/sleep-the-new-frontier-in-dementia-prevention.html?fbclid=IwAR2-_vCcGtV9BH936jTs4d5Sf24qoVKGldqt0BOuGSXszIe0dZtu_N9U7Z0">‘cleaning up’ process</a> that appears to protect us from developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. Sleep also helps us manage stress by assisting with emotional regulation and the management of cortisol levels.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Sleep Action Tip</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Getting around 7 to 9 hours sleep each night is believed to be what is required for good health. One of my favourite stress reduction (and productivity) strategies is to also <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/my-tedx-talk-indulge-your-neurobiology/">take an afternoon nap</a>. Napping is a great way to “reset” from the stressors of the day, while also smoothing out emotions and increasing clarity.</p>
<h3>2. Get moving</h3>
<p>Tight shoulders, shallow breathing, tension headaches and feels of overwhelm? Exercise can help reverse the effects of stress by releasing muscle tension, increasing oxygen levels, boosting feel-good hormones (endorphins), while also using up excess adrenaline and cortisol released as part of our stress response.</p>
<p>I find exercise one of the easiest ways to reduce my stress levels, definitely easier than thought-based or mindfulness strategies. For many people, exercise becomes an effective<em> meditation in motion</em>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23795769">Exercising outside and with others has also been linked to increased mood.</a></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Move Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">When you are feeling stressed, get moving in a way that you enjoy — go for a walk, hit the gym, swim in the ocean, take a dance class, even housework can get your heart rate up!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Outside-In Approach: Change your environment to reduce stress</h2>
<h3>3. Time in nature</h3>
<p>Sunshine, light and fresh air are nature’s way of helping us chill out and gain perspective. Time in nature helps to improve mood, reduce blood pressure and can increase our ability to concentrate. Exposure to daylight can also help us sleep better, as light regulates our natural wake and sleep cycle (circadian rhythm).</p>
<p>While we have to be sun-wise (especially here in Australia!), getting some sunshine can make us feel better and improve our mood, thanks to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680471">mood-boosting effects of vitamin D</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480364">serotonin</a>, both of which increase with sun exposure.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Nature Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Head outside to get some fresh and clear your head if you feel stress rising. Incorporate time in nature during your week to keep your stress in check —try a walk by the beach in the morning, a bushwalk on the weekend, watching a sunset or sunrise, spending time in the garden.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4. Connecting with others</h3>
<p>Our brains are wired for connection. We are born as social animals and have a fundamental need for human warmth and connection, especially when we are stressed.</p>
<p>When we connect with friends and loved ones, the bonding hormone oxytocin is released in our brain. Oxytocin not only makes us feel good, but it also lowers our stress and counteracts the effects of cortisol.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Connection Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">While it can be hard to find the time (or mental energy) to socialise when we are feeling stressed, making time to have a coffee or dinner catch up with friends or family is an effective (and fun) way to take the pressure off and keep stress under control.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Top-Down Approach: Change how you think to reduce stress</h2>
<h3>5. Mindfulness</h3>
<p>When we fixate on a problem in the future or regret from the past, worry and rumination can take hold and cause stress and anxiety. Mindfulness practices train our brain to stay in the here and now.</p>
<p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837"><strong> have been seen to be effective in buffering against stress.</strong></a> By bringing our attention back to the present moment, tuning in to our senses and using our breath to slow our heart rate, we can deactivate our stress response.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Mindful Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Slow, deep-breathing exercises evoke the relaxation response. One useful way to practice deep breathing is to use the ‘box breathing’ technique: Breathe in for four seconds. Hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds. Then pause for four seconds before taking your next breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>6. Re-think your stress response</h3>
<p>How we think about stress has a considerable effect on our body. In her TED talk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en">Make Stress Your Friend</a><em>, </em>health psychologist Kelly McGonigal explains how the belief that stress is harmful is what makes stress unhealthy, not the stress itself.</p>
<p>The negative perception of stress causes the body to change in ways that have been linked to disease and a reduction in life expectancy. However, seeing the stress response as helpful and preparing us for the challenge ahead, can stop our body responding with further stress and making us unwell.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Re-thinking Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Next time you feel stressed, notice the symptoms of stress (the racing heart, the sweaty palms), and see if you can re-frame these sensations. Can you re-think the sensation of stress as the sensation of energy, excitement or anticipation?</p>
<hr />
<p>Stress is something we all face and it can’t be avoided, and nor should we try. By working with the three core influencers of brain health, we can learn to ‘switch off’ our stress response and ‘switch on’ our relaxation response, promoting mental health and physical wellbeing.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9894">Premature Commercialization in Suicide Prediction</a></h4>

A Swedish company called Emotra make a device to detect someone's risk of suicide based on measuring the body's autonomic responses to certain sounds. It's called EDOR®.



I've been blogging about this machine for the past 18 months (1, 2, 3) because such a product, if it worked, would be very important. It could help save countless lives. Unfortunately, I don't think EDOR® has been proven to be effective. As I've argued in my previous posts, the evidence just isn't there yet.

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8<sup>th</sup> annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”</p>
<p>Wait…<em>Zombies?</em></p>
<p>While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about <span>learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.</p>
<p>“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/600918064/0/oupblogpsychology/">Explaining Freud’s concept of the uncanny</a></h4>

<p>According to his friend and biographer Ernest Jones, Sigmund Freud was fond regaling him with “strange or uncanny experiences with patients.” Freud had a “particular relish” for such stories.</p><p>2019 marks the centenary of the publication of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf">Freud’s essay, “The ‘Uncanny”.</a> Although much has been written on the essay during that time, Freud’s <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article/59/1/51/5085234">concept of the uncanny </a>is often not well understood. Typically, Freud’s theory of the uncanny is referred to under the heading of “the return of the repressed.” But Freud also offered another, more often overlooked, explanation for why we experience certain phenomena as uncanny. This has to do with the apparent confirmation of “surmounted primitive beliefs.”</p><p>According to this theory, we all inherit, both from our individual and collective pasts, certain beliefs in animistic and magical phenomena—such as belief in the existence of spirits—which most of us, Freud thought, have largely, but not totally, surmounted. “As soon as something <em>actually happens</em> in our lives,” Freud wrote, which seems to confirm a surmounted primitive belief, we get a feeling of the uncanny. Not only must the phenomenon be experienced as taking place in reality, however, it must also bring about uncertainty about what is real. As Freud put it, the phenomenon must bring about “a conflict of judgement as to whether things which been ‘surmounted’ and are regarded as incredible may not, after all, be possible.”</p><p>Consider some examples. Apparent acts of telepathy and precognition can appear to confirm belief in the omnipotence of thoughts. Waxworks and other highly lifelike human figures can appear to affirm belief in animism—the doctrine that everything is imbued with a living soul.</p><p>A remarkable illustration of Freud’s theory can be found in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/stream/MemoriesDreamsReflectionsCarlJung/Memories,%20Dreams,%20Reflections%20-%20Carl%20Jung_djvu.txt">Carl Jung’s autobiography</a>. In 1909, during a meeting between Jung and Freud, Jung “had a curious sensation,” as if his “diaphragm were made of iron and were becoming red-hot—a glowing vault.” “And at that moment,” Jung wrote, there was such a “loud report” that came from the bookcase that was standing next to them that he and Freud “started up in alarm, fearing the thing was going to topple over.” Jung said to Freud: “There, that is an example of a so-called catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.” “Oh come,’” Freud replied. “That is sheer bosh.” “You are mistaken, Herr Professor,” said Jung. “And to prove my point, I now predict that in a moment there will be another such loud report!” Jung wrote that no sooner had said these words “than the same detonation went off in the bookcase.”</p><p>“To this day I do not know what gave me this certainty.” Jung wrote. “But I knew beyond all doubt that the report would come again. Freud only stared aghast at me.”</p><p>Following the incident, Freud wrote a letter to Jung advising him to keep a “cool head.” Freud was first inclined “to ascribe some meaning” to the noise. But he subsequently made some investigations, and numerous times had observed the same noise coming from the bookcase, yet never in connection with his thoughts. “My credulity,” Freud wrote, “or at least my readiness to believe, vanished along with the spell of your personal presence.”</p><p>Freud’s theory of surmounted primitive beliefs provides an explanation for why Freud experienced the sounding bookcase uncanny. It also provides an explanation for why the event had a different effect on Jung. For Freud causal connection between Jung’s thoughts and the noise was impossible. For Jung, it merely affirmed his belief in the reality of the “catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.”</p><p>Can this theory of Freud’s be used to explain all uncanny phenomena? This does not seem likely. For a start, one may have qualms about Freud’s characterisation of primitive beliefs. It also does not seem plausible that in order to experience something as uncanny one must first have held and then surmounted a belief in its reality. What if I had never believed in the existence of ghosts, does that mean I cannot experience a ghost-like apparition as uncanny?</p><p>Can these problems with Freud’s theory be overcome? That is a task for another occasion.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Early morning in NZ” by Tobias Tullius.

The brain became a celebrity this week when Ariana Grande shared the results of a scan of her brain seemingly showing signs of severe PTSD:



Is there any science behind this?

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans. If it is an Amen scan, then the 'blobs' seen on Grande's brain represent areas of increased or decreased cerebral blood flow (C

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.</p>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Reporting on the scholarly publishing world can be a frustrating business these days, not just because the business model for journalism has all but collapsed but because scholarly publishers seem to be becoming increasingly reluctant to engage with reporters in a meaningful way, especially where the topic is open access. Their clear preference is to communicate by press release or managed events like webinars.</span><span> </span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s1600/SwatchSkinFront.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1028" data-original-width="1116" height="183" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s200/SwatchSkinFront.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In fact, this has been the favoured model of commercial legacy publishers for quite some time now. The pity is that it appears to be becoming the <i>modus operandi</i> for non-profit OA publishers and OA initiatives too. Since the <i>raison d’être</i> of OA is openness and transparency this is unfortunate. If nothing else, it smacks of hypocrisy.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>PLOS has been guilty of this in the past – see for instance </span><span><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/05/13/plos-stakeholders-and-shareholders/">this</a> from 2013. </span><span>On another occasion in 2011, when PLOS ONE published a controversial paper, I emailed a list of questions to the editorial director (after being invited to do so) only to later receive a message from the publisher saying that it had been decided not to respond to those questions. (As outlined in </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/03/plos-one-open-access-and-future-of.html"><span>this article</span></a><span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Until recently, I had assumed that <i>eLife </i>at least was fully committed to openness. In 2016, for instance, it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication"><span>posted details</span></a><span> of its publishing costs. But now I am not so sure.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I will preface my further remarks by saying that <i>eLife</i> is a frequent publisher of </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press"><span>press releases</span></a><span>, and routinely emails me copies of them. In response, I am assiduous in posting details of these releases on social media. As I see it, the relationship between <i>eLife</i> and reporters like me is a two-way thing: I publicise their press releases; they answer my questions. Simples!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, it would seem <i>eLife</i> may not see it in the same way. Let me explain. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /><a name="more"></a><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Signalling something important?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Last month, I was invited to take part in a press briefing webinar with the new <i>eLife</i> Editor-in-Chief </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen"><span>Mike Eisen</span></a><span>, who has replaced the founding EiC </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman"><span>Randy Schekman</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>During the briefing, practically all the questions posed by journalists were about business models and APCs. These did not seem to me to be questions best directed at an EiC, and in fact, Eisen had little to say in response other than that he believes APCs to be problematic and in any case the focus should be on achieving open access, not worrying about the details of business models. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In subsequently reflecting on the event it occurred to me that the appointment of Eisen is not simply the replacement of one EiC with another Rather, <i>eLife</i> is surely signalling something important about its future. So far as I am aware this point has not been made by <i>eLife</i> however, and it was not something explored in the press briefing, or indeed in subsequent reporting of the appointment (so far as I am aware).  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Maybe I am wrong, but that seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion to reach if one considers that Eisen’s OA advocacy in recent years has been almost exclusively focused on the need to move beyond the journal in favour of preprint archives and post-publication peer review, which is not what <i>eLife</i> is about. As Eisen </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>put it</span></a><span> in a recent Reddit Q&amp;A, “I would advocate doing away with ALL journals – not just for profit journals. The issue is that the idea of a journal as an entity that accepts or rejects papers and ‘publishes’ them is antiquated.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Eisen outlined his ideas on this in a post last year where he </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise"><span>described</span></a><span> what he calls an APPRAISE system.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>By contrast, <i>eLife</i> has (so far as I am aware) always positioned itself as a high-quality OA competitor to <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>. (I.e. a kind of OA mirror image of those journals). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Moreover, when pressed by its funders to become sustainable, <i>eLife </i>chose not to try something new and different, but simply emulated other publishers by introducing APCs (</span><span>$2,500 per article). It has yet to achieve sustainability, but in February the outgoing EiC <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">appeared to indicate</a> that the objective and approach remained the same, with sustainability expected to be achieved (in the next two or three years) by a doubling of the number of submissions to <i>eLife</i>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As I say, this seems very different to Eisen’s view of the world. And that is why I am inclined to conclude that his appointment suggests that <i>eLife</i> is planning to reinvent itself. Either that or there is some kind of misalignment between <i>eLife’s</i> world view and that of its new EiC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is just speculation because, as far I am aware, <i>eLife</i> has not stated that it is planning to reinvent itself. Anyway, I was by now sufficiently intrigued that </span><span>when <i>eLife’s</i> press officer contacted me after the briefing, I responded with some questions. And when it seemed that I was not making much progress that way, I suggested doing a formal Q&amp;A with <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director Mark Patterson. I was told that he was happy to do this and so emailed over the list of questions below. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Unfortunately, in a strange echo of my experience with PLOS, a week later I received an email saying, “We’ve reviewed the questions that you sent over, and there’s not much more that we’re able to add in response at this stage.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In a subsequent email I was told, “The answers to the questions we have not already addressed will become clear in time, and we’ll be happy to share more information as it’s available. Having seen all your questions, it’s simply that we’re not prepared to answer them all right now.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Out of sync?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I get that if <i>eLife</i> is in the middle of a strategic review it might not want to provide detailed answers to one or two of my questions, but for Patterson not to answer any of the questions I sent below seems out of sync both with <i>eLife’s</i> claimed commitment to openness and transparency, and with the unspoken contract I believe should exist between organisations and those like me who report on them: I publicise their news and developments; they answer my questions. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Either way, I have to wonder why <i>eLife</i> was not willing to answer some of the questions. Why, for instance, was it not prepared to say whether Eisen has ever had an EiC position before.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Likewise, why seven months after the initiative was announced was <i>eLife </i>not prepared to share with me its views on Plan S, why was it not prepared to say how many APC waivers it is granting, and why was it not prepared to rehearse for me the results of the peer review trial it held last year? Why also was it not prepared to say whether it believes Read-and-Publish agreements will prove cheaper than the traditional Big Deal, and what impact these agreements might have on small publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>More puzzlingly, why if he was unwilling to answer any of the questions I sent him did Patterson agree to do an interview in the first place?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is all the more baffling to me given that the day before <i>eLife</i> emailed to say it was not prepared to answer my questions, Eisen was introducing himself on Reddit by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>saying</span></a><span> that his objective is “to build a new ecosystem of scholarly publishing based not on journals, but on immediate, author-driven publication coupled with post-publication peer review and curation, and the role I envision <i>eLife</i> will play in this new ecosystem”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In that Q&amp;A he also said, “F1000Research isn’t, at least not yet, interested in doing anything beyond technical peer review of papers. They do an excellent job of this, but it’s a different problem than what I was thinking with APPRAISE, and now what I want to do at <i>eLife</i>, which is to help organize the literature, to help people find what’s interesting and important to them, and to help contextualize works for readers, and to help authors and people potentially interested in hiring, promoting or funding them to know what the community thinks of the quality and impact of their work.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Could not <i>eLife</i> have responded to my questions about its future strategy by at least saying something similar to that?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Financial models?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is worth noting that the very </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise#comment-155"><span>first question</span></a><span> posted in response to Eisen’s outline of his APPRAISE idea was, “Fascinating stuff, but what’s the financial model here?” – a question to which Eisen did not respond. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Certainly, if the new strategy of <i>eLife</i> involves making APPRAISE a reality some kind of a financial modelling will be necessary, not least because if the publisher is still not sustainable and its funders expect it to become so in the next few years, it will presumably need to find additional resources from somewhere. In other words, while business models may not be something Eisen is concerned about, someone at <i>eLife</i> needs to take an interest in them. It was partly in order to gain some understanding of this that I invited Patterson to do a formal Q&amp;A. And I asked him specifically because as <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director I assume that is his bag. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Doubtless the open source </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/33e4127f/elife-introduces-libero-a-new-open-source-tool-for-publishing"><span>Libero</span></a><span> products that <i>eLife</i> is co-developing are relevant here too. And I was again puzzled that <i>eLife</i> was not prepared to answer my question about its open source activities even though it has been giving webinars on the topic (e.g. </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/f8226477/in-publishing-the-latest-on-the-open-source-publishing-platform-libero"><span>here</span></a><span>). I can only conclude that while <i>eLife</i> is happy to broadcast press releases and organise managed events, it is reluctant to answer specific questions from reporters outside of these managed events. A cynic might think that this is because reporters tend to ask probing questions – questions like, “Was that a wise decision you made?” and “Where is the business model here?”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is also worth pointing out that in the webinar linked above <i>eLife</i> <u>was</u> asked about business models. The reply was that business models are not relevant to non-profits, which have only to achieve sustainability. This seems to me to miss the point that in order to achieve sustainability some kind of financial model is necessary – as Knowledge Unlatched </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html"><span>discovered</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The fact is that regardless of any new development work Eisen might be hoping to see at <i>eLife</i>, 30% of its expenditures are already going towards “technology and innovation”. Moreover, <i>eLife</i> has made it clear that Libero Publisher is being developed as a post-peer-review publishing platform, not some kind of preprint APPRAISE solution. If those authors (and/or their institutions) who are now having to pay <i>eLife</i> APCs find themselves having to subsidise a growing number of technology projects, they might start to feel a little aggrieved.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Presumably, <i>eLife</i> hopes that at some point it will be able to earn revenue from providing software-as-a-service solutions around Libero – much as </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/"><span>Public Knowledge Project</span></a><span> does with its </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/"><span>Open Journal Systems</span></a><span> platform. The challenge, of course, is that developing new publishing workflow systems is neither easy nor cheap, as PLOS <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/">discovered</a>.

I think we can see the same trend evident in the way in which Plan S was developed and proposed.

As I understand it, <i>eLife</i> was founded in 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust as a high-quality open-access journal intended to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/infographic-how-is-elife-measuring-up">compete with</a> </span><span>prestigious subscription journals like <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i> and <i>Cell</i>. Its first Editor-in-Chief was the besuited, suave Nobel prize winner Randy Schekman. Eisen is the rumbustious T-short wearing co-founder of PLOS. It was PLOS that in 2003 pioneered use of the article-processing charge (APC) and it was PLOS that in 2006 launched PLOS ONE, which is committed to publishing any paper deemed to be <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines">technically rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record</a>.  </span><span>The PLOS ONE </span><span>model has been characterised by some as <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html">bulk-publishing</a></span><span>. Eisen is also a firm <a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise">advocate for preprints</a></span><span> and in 2017 <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2017/10/q-with-plos-co-founder-michael-eisen.html">said to me</a>,</span><span> “We should all publish in bioRxiv and review papers outside of journals. It’s the only way forward.”</span><span> This would seem to be a very different view of scholarly publishing to the one that has been espoused by <i>eLife</i> to date, and so must signal a change of direction for <i>eLife</i>. How would you characterise that new direction?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Has Mike Eisen ever worked as an Editor-in-Chief before?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> was wholly subsidised by funders for the first five years, but in 2017 it introduced an APC of $2,500. It has, however, yet to become sustainable. Doubtless, that is why during the press call that Eisen gave on March 5<sup>th</sup> all bar one of the questions asked by journalists were about business models and APCs. Responsibility for business models and financial matters at <i>eLife</i> is not in fact part of Eisen’s job description. Who is responsible to the <i>eLife</i> Board for business models, financial sustainability and strategy? You as Executive Director perhaps?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>When pushed on APCs during the press call Eisen said that he views them as problematic. He did not, however, propose </span><span>any alternative way of funding <i>eLife</i>. Instead, he said that since there is enough money in the current subscription system the research community should simply focus on achieving OA rather than worrying over the details of business models. All that is needed, he said, is to reallocate subscription money to pay for OA. Leaving aside the problem of how one does that, I am wondering if the claim holds up. One of the primary reasons why librarians have been calling for open access over the past 20-odd years is that they say they cannot afford the subscription model, which they believe to be unsustainable. Their assumption has always been that open access will be cheaper and so can solve their affordability problem. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated that OA is cheaper. Nevertheless, librarians continue to insist that they should pay publishers less money. One of the reasons UC gave for walking away from its negotiations with Elsevier recently, for instance, was that the publisher was not prepared to reduce what it charges the university. As Jeff MacKie-Mason <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/02/28/why-uc-split-with-publishing-giant-elsevier/">has explained</a>,</span><span> UC set two goals when it began the negotiation: “a reduction in costs and default open access publication for UC authors”. At the same time, we could note that the <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/all-corporate-news/wiley-and-projekt-deal-partner-enhance-future-scholarly-research-an">Wiley/Project DEAL Read-and-Publish agreement</a></span><span> is not expected to be any cheaper than a traditional Big Deal. Do <i>you</i> think open access will reduce the costs of scholarly publishing? If not, will there not continue to be an unresolved problem in an OA world?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>As noted, despite introducing an APC, <i>eLife</i> is still not sustainable. The funders supporting the publisher say they want it to do so in the near future. In an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">interview</a></span><span> he gave to <i>Nature</i> in February, Randy Schekman said, “The journal still receives income from charitable funders, as well as from article-processing charges. But we hope for <i>eLife</i> to be self-sustaining within two or three years. The financial models we have drawn show that it can be done.” He added, “We believe that <i>eLife</i> has the bandwidth to grow maybe two-fold in submissions — and if we do this, we can sustain ourselves without charitable funding.” Eisen seemed unaware of this financial modelling at the time of the press call. Can you say more about it? Is it </span><span>enough (and even possible) to double submissions in the next two or three years? <i>eLife’s </i><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/50d52087/annual-report-looking-back-on-2017">2017 annual report</a></span><span> indicated that submissions fell after the introduction of an APC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In that same report, <i>eLife</i> said that around half of its submissions did not attract a fee. </span><span>I think this was partly because APCs were <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication">introduced during the reporting period</a>. </span><span>However, <i>eLife</i> does also offer <a href="https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#waiver">waivers</a></span><span> for “labs under financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or a lack of funding.” What percentage of the papers <i>eLife </i>is currently publishing are attracting a waiver, and how do you see this changing over time?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> operates a novel open and consultative peer review system. Last year it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2905802e/peer-review-elife-trials-a-new-approach"><span>announced a trial</span></a><span> to test the feasibility of what it called “a radical form of peer review” in which “once an editor has invited a manuscript for full peer review, the journal is committed to publishing the work along with the reviewer reports, the decision letter, and the author response.” Some initial results of that trial have been published </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/262c4c71/peer-review-first-results-from-a-trial-at-elife"><span>here</span></a><span>. But how would you summarise these results and how do you envisage peer review developing in future, both at <i>eLife</i> and generally in scholarly publishing, particularly in light of the growing preprint movement and Eisen’s view that peer review ought to take place “outside of journals”?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>I may have missed it, but I do not believe <i>eLife</i> has published a response to Plan S. I do know that when Schekman was </span><span>asked about Plan S in February, he <a class="" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">commented</a></span><span>, “I’m very supportive of this. Open access is the future. Commercial journals have been fighting against this very hard because it poses a clear danger to their profit margin … There will be a shakedown in the business. Some journals will lose out.” Is that <i>eLife’s </i>official position? If not, what is its position?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In light of the Project DEAL/ Wiley agreement, I am thinking that this model (and/or the Read-and-Publish </span><span>one) is likely to become the norm going forward, and I assume such deals will eventually be done with Elsevier. The problem for <i>eLife</i> I would think is that these are essentially new-style Big Deals, a model that inevitably favours large commercial legacy publishers and by its very nature tends to elbow aside small publishers like <i>eLife</i>. Unable to cut such deals with libraries, funders and/or consortia might it be that <i>eLife </i>will be one of the journals to lose out (as Schekman puts it)? How can it best adapt to the kind of changes that initiatives like Plan S are likely to introduce?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> has been actively collaborating with third-parties</span><span> (including the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation, <a href="https://coko.foundation/">Coko</a></span><span>) to build open source publishing solutions.

Can you say something about these innovative initiatives and how they fit into <i>eLife’s</i> strategy going forward?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>There has been a lot of interest in the past couple of years in developing funder publishing platforms – </span><span>primarily by using F1000 Research technology. More recently, we have seen Elsevier moving into this space too. For instance, it just announced that it has </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/journals-published-by-arab-research-community-set-to-benefit-from-greater-global-visibility-809890046.html"><span>reached agreement</span></a><span> with the Association of Arab Universities to use its proprietary platform Digital Commons (bepress) to eventually publish 1,000 Arab journals. What does this tell us about the future of scholarly communication, and where does <i>eLife</i> fit into this development? Does it?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Why is it that the topic of open access seems </span><span>only ever to be able to be discussed in terms of wide-eyed uncritical faith in “the cause”, or bad-tempered complaints about the kind of changes it is leading to – i.e. APCs, mandatory open access policies, predatory publishing etc. Can we ever expect to see a consensus over open access?

<p>Na Helian's journal club session, where she will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf">OPTICS Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (Mihael Ankerst et al, 1999)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-datasets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to thedensity-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.</p>

<h4>TL;DR talk to current students &amp; trust your instincts</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1sJEGa_4vSgBEHSvfrFn0g.jpeg" />Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/">Tony Webster</a> (Flickr Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0))</figure><p>Recruitment season is finally over, and you have a couple of weeks to decide where you’d like to spend the next chunk of your life. After several weekends spent explaining your research in 10-minute segments to complete strangers, you’re hoping to ultimately have a place to call <em>lab</em>, and a city to call <em>home</em>.</p><p>As you look back on your visits, it’s a whirlwind of graduate students, science, faculty members, walking, and beer. How, in Carl Sagan’s name, are you supposed to choose one school over another? To complicate such decisions, opaque ranking systems are putting dubious numerical values on your hodgepodge of memories and tired feet.</p><p>I’m no expert on choosing graduate schools or advisors — after all, I’ve only done it once. However, I’ve witnessed my colleagues disperse in all sorts of directions as far as institutions and advisors, some for better, and some for <em>ehh </em>not so good.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*7HIduiCLF0tvZAuo.gif" /></figure><p><strong>Who are you? </strong>Before comparing programs, it’s a good idea to do some personal reflection. It’s impossible to know how you’ll feel at the end of graduate school, or even in a year, but your current decision depends on how you feel now. Check in with yourself:</p><ul><li>Why are you going to graduate school?</li><li>What do you see yourself doing after graduate school?</li><li>With those two answers in mind, how long would you like to spend in graduate school?</li><li>Based on prior work experience, consider the kind of leadership you work well with. Do you prefer supervisors to be hands-off, or very involved in your daily activities?</li><li>Consider taking <a href="http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/">this comprehensive survey</a> sponsored by AAAS to help identify your needs, strengths, and weaknesses, as well your career options.</li></ul><p>Now, young reckless Jedi, ready are you?</p><h4><strong>Did you like the students?</strong></h4><p>This is a major aspect of visiting the campus. Did you meet people you can see being scientifically as well as socially supportive? Were they, in general, pleasant? The emotional state of students (especially those past the third year) is incredibly indicative of the health of a graduate program. Think about the kind of people you want to be surrounded by for the next five years; even if the individuals change, the ethos of the program is unlikely to change that quickly.</p><h4><strong>All together now.</strong></h4><p>Science thrives in a collaborative and cohesive environment built on personalities that promote these characteristics. Ask students if they would feel comfortable asking another student in the program for experience or insight on a particular project or technique. In most of the places I’ve worked, people readily email around to borrow reagents or equipment and research moves quicker as a result. An institution that promotes collaboration across students and labs is likely to be a happier and better place to do science.</p><h4><strong>Make sure there are five advisors you can imagine yourself working with </strong>(applicable for programs with research rotations).</h4><p>Hopefully, you’ve heard this already: do not choose an institution for <em>one</em> star faculty member. Yes, you interviewed with them and the research is absolutely jaw dropping, but you should not depend on one person unless you have an explicit agreement with them or extensive prior experience with the lab.</p><p>Make sure there are 2–3 people you’re confident would be a good fit, with at least another 2 that you see as very strong possibilities. Reflect on your own goals for the type of research you hope to do (behind a computer or a lab bench?) and make sure the institution has several faculty members in each corner of your comfort zone.</p><p>Lastly, compare your expectations for the length of your PhD to the program’s average as well as the labs that interest you. Some advisors regularly have graduate students for 7+ years, whereas others are known for graduating students much earlier. You might not mind sticking around for 7 years, but it’s a good thing to know in advance.</p><h4><strong>Ask ahead of time about funding.</strong></h4><p>If you’re not coming in with your own funding, make sure the program will fund you for at least the first year. It is a very good sign if the program has <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants">an institutional training grant</a> (hint: you can search for your institution/organization on <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/">NIH RePORT</a>).</p><p>If you’re worried about funding in a particular lab, it is definitely okay to ask if they will be able to fund you. Funding is a fact of life in science; the earlier you have those open conversations, the better off you’ll be.</p><h4><strong>Ensure there is administrative infrastructure for student support.</strong></h4><p>You want an administration that will help structure your experience in graduate school, elicit and implement your feedback, as well as springboard you into the next phase of your career. Graduate school can be quite amorphous without some structure; although this is okay for some students, it can be unmanageable for others.</p><p>Some programs involve students on executive committees and schedule yearly feedback meetings. Not only does this demonstrate that the program cares, but also that it is organized enough internally to seek external advice. It’s definitely a plus if the department takes the time and money to plan seminar series and social events for students.</p><h4><strong>It’s not <em>all </em>about the science.</strong></h4><p>Of course, you want to attend a university with an abundance of top-notch research, but you also need to be in a place where you can be a happy person. It is not shallow or unprofessional to choose a place where you think you’ll feel safe and at ease. You might decide that you’d prefer to be in a bustling city versus a quiet suburb, or in a place that offers cultural and social opportunities that fit your needs. You’ll spend long hours in the lab, but you also need long hours relaxing and doing things that you love, like <a href="https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/the-picnic-guidelines-re-written-1a8a9ef0841c">having picnics</a>. After all, your life outside of the lab enhances your ability to do good science.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TtUmE7IrPaTvTrij3avIjA.jpeg" />It’s totally reasonable to choose a program simply because of the presence of palm trees. Too far? Too far. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)</figure><p>If you’re currently making a choice between schools, don’t hesitate to ask additional questions of your host, other graduate students, or faculty you spoke to. This is your chance to gather as much information as you can so that you can feel confident in your decision. If they don’t answer your concerns, you may have your answer right there.</p><p>Spend a week pretending you’re going to one school. Take the next week and pretend you’re going to another school. Dwell on those indescribable responses to how it feels, remain open to unforeseen opportunities, and trust your intuition. As Richard Feynman aptly said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”</p><p>This was originally posted on <a href="https://neuwritesd.org/2014/03/20/you-interviewed-now-what/"><em>NeuWriteSD</em></a><em> </em>and has been edited to update its content.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist?

<p>What’s on your “to-read” list this year?</p>
<p>Here are a few books that I’ve read (or plan to in 2019) chosen based on research rigour, chosen, publication date (the last year or two) and practical application.

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/28/the-compatibility-of-stem-and-spirituality/">Making Space for Spirituality</a></h4>

<p>Having been raised Catholic, I have a confession to make: I have found it difficult to make room for spirituality and religion in a STEM-focused society. Not in my personal life exactly, but in my community and conversations. I think it’s partly because people have such varying conceptions of spiritual life, God, or gods. And because we don’t talk about it freely, when someone does bring up anything related to this subject, it’s easy to become immediately wary: is this person trying to convert me or take my money?</p>
<p>How about a third option: what if that person is trying to tell you about a powerful experience they had, which they cannot fully explain using known, familiar concepts or which seems to be at least partly outside of human control?</p>
<p>I think, for a lot of people, it’s actually something closer to this third idea that motivates us to talk about spirituality and God. And that may be the key to why it’s hard to discuss these things in certain STEM communities. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are about curiosity, innovation, achievement – rewarding for sure – but they are also often about control and precision, human definitions and limitations.</p>
<p>In my view, if you need to know that something is conceptually possible with a certain regard for grace and beauty, you may be a mathematician. If you need to know something well enough to be confident that it will work reliably and consistently – and that you can fix it when it goes wrong – you might be an engineer or doctor. If you need to examine every little detail, control every factor and condition, and measure everything precisely and then report your findings in a strictly structured format, you are probably a hard scientist. Given each of these approaches to inquiry and the effect they may have on your world view, your conception of God is likely to be quite different.</p>
<p>You might also still feel that sense of wonder and awe that some folks ascribe to religion and spirituality. Except, instead of feeling that sense when you enter a religious venue or contemplate a starry sky, perhaps you feel that sense in the infinite combinations of factors that your experimental setup can produce. And I’m not speaking cynically of electrical noise or undetermined behavioral influences that plague experimental scientists. I mean the vast space of possibility associated with randomness, Brownian motion, genetic mutations and the like.</p>
<p>I believe that one acceptable definition of God to say God is in the things we don’t understand, in the concepts and people that we value but have not figured out. In this way, the concept of God is compatible with a fully formed and intricate understanding of biology, astronomy, natural history, and human relations. Being a generally warm-hearted and optimistic person, I also think of God as a force for love, growth, and connection between persons, nature, and other living things.</p>
<p>Beyond the concept of God or spirituality, there is also the concept of religion: the specific ways in which we worship or view God. Sometimes it may seem that science and religion are incompatible, or are less compatible than science and spirituality. However, the domains of each are largely separate. To the extent that they overlap, it is worth exploring how each can benefit the other. For example, can science or medicine instruct us as to how to safely heal spiritual injuries? Or can religious traditions and rituals point us to some fundamental biological truth or natural observation? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/sunday/science-religion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perhaps so</a>.</p>
<p>I have actually experienced the healing of a spiritual injury in myself by someone with a scientific background. It had not been an experience I was expecting, nor one that I had even considered possible. But it happened and was a remarkable experience that felt very intense and difficult to describe to most people. After it happened, I felt quite strongly that something about my spiritual state had been altered. I have often contemplated the scientific basis for the sensations and feelings that occurred in me during this healing process. I do believe there are some, although I am unsure whether it is wise and necessary to delve far into the intricate details of my brain state, or whether that endeavor would be akin to chasing the biological basis for free will.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I am becoming aware of just how little I discuss anything religious or spiritual. I feel that it is an awkward conversation to have, mostly because I assume everyone rushes to judgment about a religious speaker, as I do sometimes. I think the problem is also because I am out of practice discussing religion and spirituality. It is not a conversation that I hear or participate in often. I find myself hesitant to bring it up, not knowing where other people stand. And I feel uncomfortable to bring up a topic that almost no one else in my current environment discusses.</p>
<p>It would be easy – and wrong – to pin my dilemma on my STEM community. This topic has been difficult for me to discuss even among members of my church community, people with whom I supposedly share a similar worldview, spiritual outlook, and religious foundation. In an article noting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/sunday/talk-god-sprituality-christian.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the difficulty of talking about God</a> in this modern and busy world, author Jonathan Merritt observed that the decline in our spiritual vocabulary and proficiency has real consequences for the spiritual life of the community. Those consequences are negative and undesirable for the community, whether or not you believe in spiritual power or religion. And so, out of respect for the humanity and potential of our communities, I believe it is worth exploring how we can include a vocabulary of spirituality and religion in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/vocation-college-higher-ed.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academia generally and STEM fields specifically</a>.</p>

<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum</h4>
<p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in a better way.</p>
<p>Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right" id="attachment_5698" style="width: 310px;"><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5698" height="350" src="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Sensory enhancement is encoded in the presynaptic activity level of Climbing Fibers.</strong> Comparison of the sensory enhancement of calcium event amplitudes in Climbing Fibers compared to observations in Purkinje cells, measured in separate experiments. The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.</p></div>
<p>“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”</p>
<p>To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.</p>
<p>“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.</p>
<p>Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.</p>
<p>“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing fiber is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “</p>
<p>“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”</p>

<p>Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.</p>
<h4>Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?</h4>
<p>I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.</p>
<h4>How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?</h4>
<p>Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.</p>
<h4>What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?</h4>
<p>My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?</h4>
<p>I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>Often times in academia, there is a tendency to branch out on more and more tangents. This can be a good thing, in terms of intellectual freedom, boundless creativity, fresh material for the continual grant application. However, it also seems to be a way of escaping accountability, of rendering academic research one giant project in busywork.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of research if not to apply it (eventually)? Sometimes it is just fun to be curious and learn something that may someday be useful or is perhaps just interesting or fun to observe. But there are also many fields in which aimlessness is celebrated or encouraged. That is one of the beautiful parts of science, which can also allow for exciting discoveries to be made that later turn out to have highly significant effects. There are also fields in which abstraction or unapplicable revelations can stand on their own and are celebrated or mined for value: mathematics, philosophy, other arts and humanities are just as capable of producing this type of academic output.</p>
<p>If we get rather granular about the output of our field of research, the beauty and futility of it can become apparent and even coexist together. I had such an experience while working on my PhD project, a detailed computer model of a small part of the brain involved with memory. I wanted to base my model on the biology of the network as best I could. There were quite a few articles already published by anatomists, detailing the intricate studies done to count the numbers and types of neurons (brain cells) in that part of the brain. Those same scientists had also done meticulous work dying brain cells and characterizing their exact shape, size, and numbers of contacts with nearby cells. After sorting through all this published experimental data, which had taken years and years of work by dozens or hundreds of (mostly Hungarian) anatomists, I had a thought: what are we actually doing with this data? I wanted to use it to build a biologically realistic computer model, but might someone else want to use the data as well?</p>
<p>And if someone else wanted the data too, might it be worthwhile to somehow collate the data into a usable format that incorporates as much similar data as possible into a single product that can be used for reference?</p>
<p>I ended up doing just that, in a project that I now refer to as the <a href="https://www.sporadicsynapse.com/scientific-projects/quantitative-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative assessment</a>. This project then was able to form the basis for my larger research product, the detailed model and its resulting simulations. However, I also like the quantitative assessment on its own. I like how it makes use of the published literature, how it highlights and makes accessible a large body of mildly neglected facts that were gathered over years and years.</p>
<p>Much of the work in the published literature seems to lie around untouched, gathering dust, so I am always excited to hear about applications, databases, large review-type projects, and other methods to integrate or apply published data. Without such initiatives, we risk turning academia and especially science into a closed-loop system that is inaccessible to the broader public and to human-relevant progress and clinical applications.</p>
<p>With those concerns in mind, I was excited to stumble across a relatively new initiative by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that seeks to make use of the large body of published literature in the service of human health. The NIH’s <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dtr/adult-psychopathology-and-psychosocial-interventions-research-branch/computational-psychiatry-program.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computational Psychiatry</a> research funding initiative respects the significant amount of data available about psychiatric conditions and treatments, and it encourages scientists to apply algorithms to those information resources to multiple or exponentially increase their diagnostic and clinical value. It’s an example of a novel emphasis on existing literature that has a direct benefit to humankind in a relatively short time frame. In short, it’s an effective way of capitalizing on a large body of work already done, a smaller extra investment of time that can amplify the impact of the time already spent building the literature foundation for psychiatric conditions and treatments.</p>
<p>Our understanding of psychiatric conditions has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/preventing-mental-illness.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more sophisticated</a> and respectful of the whole person, with the advent of concepts such as formulation (instead of diagnosis) and the greater appreciation for contribution of a person’s life experience to the state of their brain and mind. The new emphasis on computational psychiatry complements this growing interest while also harnessing the power of our expanding computational infrastructure.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that the brain retains its capacity to form and remove whole synapses in adulthood.
This type of plasticity, termed structural plasticity, is capable of altering connectivity, and therefore function, of neuronal networks of the brain over periods of days and months.
Although reports of disruptive effects of structural plasticity remain scarce, a number of lesion experiments have described the time course of synaptic structures during network reorganisation by homeostatic structural plasticity in great detail.
The underlying mechanisms that drive these changes, however, are yet to be explained.
To investigate the dynamics of synaptic structures reported in these lesion studies, we replicated a peripheral lesion in a biologically plausible spiking network model that exhibits cortical asynchronous irregular firing.
Here, we present results from our computational modelling study.</p>
<p>Results from our simulations suggest that for activity to be restored to deprived neurons in the lesion projection zone (LPZ), excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic structures must exhibit opposite activity dependent growth behaviours.
Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they contribute to the maintenance of optimal activity levels in individual neurons.
Where a reduction in neuronal activity results in the sprouting of new excitatory post-synaptic structures, it is accompanied by the retraction of their inhibitory counterparts.
Extra activity is similarly countered by a retraction of excitatory post-synaptic structures and sprouting of inhibitory ones.
Our simulations also reproduce the ingrowth of excitatory axons into, and the outgrowth of inhibitory axons out from the LPZ that have been observed in lesion experiments.
We find that the ingrowth of excitatory axons requires that sprouting of excitatory pre-synaptic structures be stimulated by extra excitatory neuron activity.
The outgrowth of inhibitory axons, on the other hand, necessitates the sprouting of inhibitory pre-synaptic structures to be prompted by a loss in inhibitory neuron activity.
In conclusion, by modelling repair following deafferentation that is faithful to experimental findings, we make testable predictions on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/21/safe-spaces-versus-confronting-reality/">Safe spaces versus confronting reality</a></h4>

<p>One debate about college environments that keeps coming up is that of free speech versus safe spaces, how to balance the basic expectation of civility and respect that students have when they attend university  with the need to be pushed out of our safe spaces to produce the growth and education that universities are called to give students.</p>
<p>Not being a minority in any sense of the word, I’m not going to attempt to tackle in this post how we could balance our duty to provide underrepresented students the same level of stability and basic comfort and respect that the rest of us already expect when we move throughout our campus communities. But what I do want to talk about today is what we can do after someone’s comfort zone has been breached.</p>
<p>Because we know it’s going to happen. And it will happen for all of us at some point during our college careers, hopefully more than just once. Those times of discomfort are necessary for growth, if we know how to care for them and use them to our benefit when they arise. So, I think the focus of the discussion about safe spaces and triggers can be shifted slightly to make the discussion more fruitful.</p>
<p>What I would discuss instead is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we identify when someone is experiencing one of these, or recognize when we ourselves are in one of these events?</li>
<li>How can we turn one of these events into an opportunity for constructive growth, meaning furthering education about the world or acquiring greater self knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first goal involves being aware of the internal feelings and assumptions of ourselves and others. This means being able to tolerate, to some extent, the discomfort of bodily feelings. It also means being proficient at reading other people and having some knowledge of their goals, values, and assumptions prior to the event. It requires a certain level of confidence and a sense of self and knowledge of the ability to tolerate extreme and unanticipated stress.</p>
<p>The second goal requires a knowledge of the resources available to us and others. This may include counselors and other therapeutic healing practices, as well as various forms of communication.</p>
<p>We also need to determine what is an appropriate level of discomfort or trigger. This is where things get very controversial. In general, at the college level especially, there is no one appropriate level of intellectual offense beyond which a line has been crossed, as long as we’re discussing communicating ideas  via legal and appropriate means such as via text books, civil discussion and lectures, movies, homework and class projects.</p>
<p>The usefulness of a lesson is lost if it traumatizes the student. Responsible faculty would try to reduce this risk by avoiding lessons or modes of communication that they reasonably expect to be traumatic to their students.</p>
<p>But since we often don’t know the personal history, original culture, and life experiences of the people around us, we can’t be assured of whether something is experienced by them as traumatic or not. I had a horrible experience at a seminar in college where we watched a graphic movie. We had been told ahead of time that we would be watching a movie about a violent rape and double murder and that the movie would be exploring the theme of forgiveness in what seems like an impossible situation. The seminar was not required, but I went anyway because I have often wondered about the concept of forgiveness, something that I struggle with myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Anyway, we watched the movie, and it was way more traumatic than I expected. I couldn’t complain, because I found myself just being grateful that I wasn’t the person being depicted on screen. To me, the violence looked real. My physiological system couldn’t differentiate between seeing the event through the TV screen versus in real life, and it felt horrible to sit there watching people’s lives end brutally. It was so triggering for me that I couldn’t comprehend what the movie was trying to teach me about forgiveness. I didn’t get a debrief afterward either, so I was just haunted by what I had witnessed without any real growth from it. I also felt creeped out that no one around me seemed to be reacting as strongly as I was to seeing something so terrifying.</p>
<p>I reasoned that I shouldn’t complain about not being given sufficient warning before seeing something so horrible, because the people who it happened to in real life hadn’t been warned either. But the ostensible point of the film was not to traumatize its viewers. And the forum in which we were watching it was not supposed to do that either, it was supposed to get us thinking about the concept of forgiveness. I left the seminar in a state of mild shock and with no further understanding of forgiveness, such as the difference between transactional forgiveness and a state forgiveness. For me, that movie and that lesson failed.</p>
<p>And that is an example of a potential learning opportunity gone horribly wrong. Ideally, the seminar could have included a discussion of how we were feeling after having watched something so awful and an overview of the resources available to us to recover from it. We could have also had a meatier discussion about types and instances of forgiveness in our own lives or in the lives of famous historical figures, with several different viewpoints and situations being introduced to us to broaden our minds.</p>
<p>I eventually discovered or was introduced to the writings of folks such as Martin Luther King Jr, Thich Nhat Hanh, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and more. I learned about the shades of different emotions and spiritual states by reading Martha Nussbaum. But it took me years to do this, years during which I could have benefited from already having that spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these opportunities of difficulty and discomfort that faculty may seek out for their students and that students ideally learn to seek out for themselves are not in themselves wrong or politically distasteful. It is more that they are only responsible, they are only civil and respectful of people with diverse backgrounds and underrepresented students, if we make sure to debrief and heal anyone who has been traumatized afterward, and if we continue the discussion until we have heard and debated the diverse perspectives of the other participants. Notably, this means that we may need to iterate between healing and further discussions, because students who were traumatized by the original lecture or seminar content are not in a position to then continue the discussion. If we don’t allow for healing followed by further discussions, then the “learning experience” becomes just an excuse to further traumatize already disadvantaged members of the student population.</p>

Scientific papers should have two Discussion sections - one written by the authors, and the other by an independent researcher.

According to a new paper from Michael S. Avidan, John P. A. Ioannidis and George A. Mashour, this "second discussant" system could help ensure more balanced and objective inference in science.



The authors begin by noting that while the reproducibility crisis has focussed attention on the Methods and Results sections of papers, Discussion sections are not free

<p>Edward Wakelam's journal club session, where he will present his work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student’s likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those at risk of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, though data mining and machine learning approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. Ed describes an experiment conducted on a final year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data is limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. Ed found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially at risk.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/599785588/0/oupblogpsychology/">Warning: music therapy comes with risks</a></h4>

<p>Bob <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://genius.com/The-wailers-trenchtown-rock-lyrics">Marley sings</a>, “One good thing about music—when it hits you, you feel no pain.” Although this may be the case for some people and in some circumstances, we dispute this statement as a global truth. After all, couldn’t any phenomenon commanding enough to alleviate human pain (ostensibly instantaneously) also harbor the potential to catalyze undesirable, even injurious, effects? And couldn’t this influence then logically extend to music employed within the context of a therapeutic process? As music therapist and Concordia University Associate Professor <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/02/challenging-assumptions-how-music-helps/">Dr. Laurel Young writes,</a> “the ‘miraculous’ effects of music as featured in popular media along with the widely accepted notion that music is a ‘universal’ medium can lead to false generalizations and over-simplification of how music can and should be used in healthcare or other psychosocial contexts.” One possible manifestation of this oversimplification is to view music as a noninvasive and wholly-positive cure-all, and thus disregard the potential risks associated with music engagement.</p><p>All therapeutic encounters carry possible risks. In fact, a certain level of risk-taking is necessary for any significant and enduring change to occur. And so, all therapists need a detailed understanding of relevant risks in order to discern the optimal risk-benefit ratio for the people who enlist their services.</p><p>The potential risks of music therapy vary according to the type of music experience, or <em>method</em>, employed. Depending on clients’ needs, they may be invited to improvise, perform, compose, or listen and respond to music. Music therapists must not only understand the inherent benefits of these various methods, but also the unique risks associated with each.</p><p><em>Improvising</em> is making up music on the spot. Whereas improvising on percussion instruments in a group session may promote a sense of cohesion among adults seeking mental health treatment, for people whose connection with reality is tenuous, repetitive rhythmic sounds hold the potential to evoke psychotic reactions. And, while improvising with their voices, clients may experience various levels of emotionally-charged self-consciousness. Beyond embarrassment from using their voices and words in this expository way, the experience may evoke long-buried, unconscious memories and associations of an unpleasant or even traumatizing nature.</p><div><figure><img height="300" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dv1otOSyQwM-1-744x496.jpg" width="450" /><em>Image credit: “three persons playing sundry instruments at home” by Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz.

However, they may also experience intense anxiety, dissatisfaction, and humiliation if the musical parts do not fit together as anticipated during the school assembly.</p><p>As an abused teen works with a therapist while <em>composing</em> an original song or instrumental piece, the energies brought to bear through musical tensions and resolutions, or the moods evoked by the sonic qualities of certain instruments, may be incongruous with the client’s lyrics. This may distort rather than clarify the client’s inner experiences, which could complicate the therapeutic process.</p><p>Finally, risks inherent to a music <em>listening</em> experience may include overstimulation and confusion. This would be a relevant consideration for a person who has sustained a brain injury or who has a neurologic disorder that impacts their ability to make meaning of sensory input. And, while a listener takes in music to guide their movement schemes, as when dancing for self-expression or the release of stress, there is always the risk of physical injury.</p><p>A primary responsibility of the music therapist is to intentionally design and facilitate all four methods and their innumerable variations to support clients as they face life’s trials, identify new options for acting, and build on personal and collective capacities toward enhanced health and wellbeing. Additionally, it is the therapist’s ethical duty to consider carefully the possible risks intrinsic to each type of music experience and to share this knowledge with the client as appropriate, with the ultimate aim of protecting their safety and promoting their agency in the therapeutic process.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “a group of musical instruments including a guitar, drum, and keyboard” by Brian Goodman.

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience announces the appointment of two Max Planck Society Fellows, Drs. Michael Halassa and Yi Zuo. The fellowship program is supported by Germany’s Max Planck Society to promote cooperation between outstanding university professors and Max Planck Society researchers for a five-year period. The fellowship program is a longstanding hallmark of Max Planck Society collaborations, with more than 100 fellows being placed into collaborations with Max Planck Institutes around the world since the program began in 2005. Dr. Hallassa and Dr. Zuo are the first researchers to be awarded a Max Planck Society Fellowship at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, which was established in 2010 as the first and only Max Planck Institute in North America.</p>
<p>Michael Halassa is an associate investigator at the <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/">McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT </a>and an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences. During his fellowship, he will focus on research that provides new insights into the functional organization of the neural circuits underlying higher cognitive function that will have a significant impact on the field, and may be relevant for understanding conditions such as autism and attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>Dr. Halassa well known for his pioneering work on the neural circuits that give rise to cognitive processes like attention and executive function. His work focuses on understanding the role of the thalamus in cognition. He is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes, including the 2017 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in the Biomedical Sciences and the 2015 Daniel X.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/599743166/0/oupblogpsychology/">Theranos and the cult of personality in science and tech</a></h4>

<p>Elizabeth Holmes was a chemical engineering student who dropped out of Stanford to found Theranos: a silicon-valley start-up company that, at one point, was valued at US$9 billion. Her plan was to be another Steve Jobs and, for a while, it looked like that would happen. She made the cover of magazines like <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Fortune</em>, and even <em>Glamour</em>, wearing black polo-neck shirts and was touted as being the next big thing. Former President Clinton was a fan. Former Secretary-of-State George Schultz was an investor and on the Theranos board as were Henry Kissinger and James (Mad Dog) Mattis who stepped down as Secretary of Defense last year.</p><p>Today, she is facing fraud and other criminal charges.</p><p>It’s a long, fascinating story. Essentially, her technology was supposed to revolutionise health care: automatically performing hundreds of blood tests on a couple of drops of blood in just a few minutes. In reality, it was no more carefully thought out than an undergraduate research project. She lied to her staff, lied to her investors, lied to her board, and lied to her company’s potential customers. Her company claimed it was using new technology to perform blood tests when, in fact, it was using the same equipment as every other lab (except Theranos got poorer results because they did not have enough blood to do the tests properly).</p><p>All this is detailed in the book <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549478/bad-blood-by-john-carreyrou/9781524731656/"><em><strong>Bad Blood</strong></em></a> by John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal investigative reporter who broke the story with the help of whistle-blowers.</p><p>What fascinates me about this saga is how the scam was able to go on for so long: more than 10 years. In that time there was an incredible rate of staff turnover (including one suicide), endless lawsuits, countless missed deadlines, and a seeming inability to finish any serious studies that demonstrated the technology worked. At one stage, Holmes was even asked to step down by members of her board but managed to talk them out of it.</p><p>The cult of personality that grew up around Elizabeth Holmes accounts for both her success and failure. By all accounts she is an incredibly magnetic person and – at least to begin with – most people found her an inspiring leader and visionary. This is what made it possible to raise millions of dollars, get such prominent people on her board, and attract a lot of incredibly talented people to work with and for her.</p><p>Steve Jobs, of course, was famous for a similar kind of charisma and bullying (also an issue at Theranos), so perhaps it’s not surprising that the ‘reality-distortion field’ associated with him was present here too. But, of course, Steve Jobs wasn’t alone. He had Steve Wozniak, the technical brains that made Apple possible. Jobs could play the visionary, safe in the knowledge that Woz (and others that followed) would look after the details.</p><p>Elizabeth didn’t have that: in fact, the cult of personality built up around her made it impossible for her <em>Woz</em> to emerge.</p><div><blockquote><p>Experts don’t like being undervalued, so the naysayers start to leave and the yes-men take their places.</p></blockquote></div><p>Where there is a Great Leader figure – in business, politics, tech, academia – who doesn’t have the personality or maturity to use their power wisely, there is often a predictable downward spiral. First, our hero starts to believe that their initial success comes from extraordinary talent, and that despite their lack of education or training or experience (or all of the above) they are the only ones capable of realising their vision. This strips away any humility they might have had. Even if they have a lot of great people around them, their belief in their own exceptionalism leads them to start overruling those who disagree based on instinct rather than expertise.</p><p>Experts don’t like being undervalued, so the naysayers start to leave and the yes-men take their places. They tell the boss what the boss wants to hear, true or not. This makes those left who are willing to speak out seem even more whiney in contrast, making the ‘great leader’ paranoid. Now, <em>loyalty </em>is the ultimate virtue: not to the original idea or mission of the company, but to the leader. Being a team player starts being equated with doing what you’re told. Because performance now comes second to obedience, mediocrity thrives. There is no voice for excellence. Ironically, of course, the people with the most integrity and genuine passion for the project are the most likely to leave, leaving the opportunists behind.</p><p>This paranoia also cultivates a culture of secrecy and centralisation, where the left hand is prevented from knowing what the right is doing for fear that they may conspire. People are discouraged from asking questions and start to hear the answer, “Because I said so.” This lack of transparency leads to poor communication, misunderstanding of problems, and inefficiency. Since staff have no agency, many feel absolved of personal responsibility. When asked to behave unethically, they feel they have no choice. This is a road not just to failure, but disaster.</p><p>We need to stop looking for the next great leader and focus on looking for great ideas. We will figure out which will succeed and which will fail not through being charmed, or going with our gut, or believing in the latest genius, but by asking intelligent and probing questions and teaming up with people who are working hard to find answers. Yes, it’s easier to sit back passively and ride on some great leader’s coat tails. If you do, however, don’t count on reaching the destination you had in mind.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: ““828584” by Free-Photos.

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9868">Are Atheists Genetically Damaged?</a></h4>

I just came across a paper with an interesting title: The Mutant Says in His Heart, “There Is No God”.

The conclusions of this work are even more interesting. According to the authors, Edward Dutton et al., humans evolved to be religious and atheism is caused (in part) by mutational damage to our normal, religious DNA. Atheists, in other words, are genetic degenerates.





Despite the talk of mutations, there is no genetics in this paper. No atheist genomes were sequenced and found to

<p>After reading this amazing story of a neuroscience professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who is speaking out about harassment in science and other STEM fields, I realized just how little I’ve spoken up about harassment that I have witnessed or received as a female scientist and engineer. Thank you for modeling the actions of responsible scientists, Professor <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/neuroscientist-fighting-sexual-harassment-science-her-own-job-peril" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BethAnn McLaughlin</a>.</p>
<p>What I most value about her work, from my brief glimpse provided by Science Magazine, is that Professor McLaughlin holds harassers accountable for their detriment to science. Her key point: harassers are not just destroying others’ careers and spirits, they are sabotaging their research fields. Now funding agencies are taking notice, such as the National Institutes of Health (<a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/11/09/new-application-requirements-for-institutional-training-grants-letter-of-institutional-commitment-to-harassment-and-discrimination-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIH</a>) and National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/odi/harassment.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NSF</a>), two of the largest funding agencies of biological sciences research in academia. The NIH and NSF are defining their expectations that grant funds (taxpayer dollars) not be used to pay for the time and space it takes to house a harasser within groping distance of other researchers and academics.</p>
<p>Setting standards as the NIH and NSF have done is important, but it’s not enough. As a tax-paying U.S. citizen, I want the expectations of the funding organizations to be even higher for the institutions receiving those funds. Research institutions and universities must set, communicate, and maintain clear standards of behavior for all roles defined by the institution, so that it’s clear to all members of the group what the mission of the group is and how each role works together to fulfill the mission.</p>
<p>Of the various science and engineering experiences I have had so far in my career, I’ve met a lot of people passionate about their field of study. I have also met a lot of people who are hard workers. These two traits often overlap, but not always. I once had a boss who was quite passionate about his field of study but was a lousy member of the academic community. That experience cost me too much in time, mental health, career prospects, and productivity. What I learned scientifically and professionally during that time was not worth the heartache associated with working in an abusive environment.</p>
<p>This experience happened while I was an undergraduate student at another university. I had wanted to spend a summer in a different state, so I applied to an NSF-funded program hosted by a large university and was excited when I found out I was accepted and had been assigned to a specific lab. But as the summer got closer, I began to feel a little uncomfortable that the program wasn’t better organized. It wasn’t always clear who was in charge and what administrative support would be available to us as we joined our new labs and made our way through an unknown university system.</p>
<p>When I finally got there and made my way to the advisor’s office for my assigned lab, I was confused to discover that I would actually be reporting to someone else I didn’t know at all, a postdoc in the same lab. I didn’t know any better and was complacent as the advisor escorted me to this new, de facto boss who was an immigrant from another country with strong cultural differences compared to the general culture of the United States. There was a mismatch of expectations between myself and my de facto boss that made the program a horrible experience for me. I thought I was signing onto a 10-week long intensive research-and-writing program; he thought he was getting an indentured servant for 7 years.</p>
<p>The lab seemed normal at first, except for the unexpected arrangement of reporting to this random postdoc rather than the listed advisor for the lab. I wasn’t yet used to how hierarchical the academic environment can be; my regular research experience at my undergraduate institution was professional and involved being in regular contact with the direct advisor of the lab. At this internship, however, I found myself alternating between working at a desk station set up for me in the main lab and the postdoc’s office, which was on another floor and only shared with one officemate who was hardly in the office.</p>
<p>The postdoc started isolating me almost immediately, though I didn’t realize it at first. He dismissed the undergraduate journal article which was supposed to be my main deliverable at the end of the program and my main project throughout the program. He directed me to work on his manuscript instead, saying that we could quickly write a trimmed-down version at the end of the 10 weeks to satisfy the requirement for my own program.</p>
<p>At first I didn’t think much of his priority realignment. I went about my day dutifully, learning the scientific and design concepts behind the engineering project. I read journal articles, learned a new software system, designed engineering devices, and carried out experiments. Sometimes the postdoc would mentor me or be friendly. But other times he would just watch me work, or grab another student and stand behind me together, watching and talking about me in another language as if I were a zoo animal.</p>
<p>About 6 weeks into the program, I began to get pretty nervous about my paper, having spent all my time on my boss’s manuscript. He noticed my anxiety and asked me to talk to him in his office. But when I got there, he started holding my hand and laughing at me when I told him to stop or tried to remove it. He escalated his behavior, groping my chest, blocking my exit out the door when I tried to leave or escape, and assailing me like an octopus with slimy tentacles when I tried to continue my work. I felt disgusted and violated. I also felt trapped, wondering how I could make him stop.</p>
<p>He would laugh sadistically at my distress and tears, ignore me when I told him to stop touching me, and make fun of me when I got mad at his abuse. I started avoiding his office, preferring the safety of the communal lab environment downstairs. But he followed me down there, sitting near me and making creepy sexual references as I tried to concentrate on my work. He was unconcerned with my dissent and lack of interest in him. I felt terrified that words like “no,” “stop,” or “leave me alone” meant nothing to him. He would get mad at me for not initiating my own abuse, or for insisting on working in the main lab, or for crying. The strength of his internal delusions became clear after awhile, as he insisted that he would “never hurt me” while watching me cry, or when he said sadistically, “I don’t think you would ever report me to anyone.” He had no concept of me as a separate human being with a voice that mattered, a person who had joined a lab to do scientific research. It was extremely frustrating and I didn’t know how to make it stop, since talking to him and telling him to stop wasn’t working. Eventually I stopped putting up a fight and telling him “no,” because it wasn’t working and it was too scary for me to continue acknowledging that my words meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>I did end up reporting him to the police years later, as well as to his wife. But what I really needed and didn’t have during that 10 week summer program was knowledge of the resources available at that school to people like me. I wasn’t a regular undergraduate student there and so I didn’t know whether the services of the university were available to someone like me. I also wasn’t sure who to talk to or how my situation would be dealt with. I was scared that all the hard work I had put into his manuscript for the past several weeks would be lost, that I would get kicked out of the lab with nothing to show for all my time, effort, and competence. The program I had joined hadn’t explained what campus resources were available to us, nor how to deal with sexual harassment and assault.</p>
<p>Nor did it cover how to deal with a boss who is emotionally abusive, independent of sexual harassment. My boss would regularly make me feel guilty about not taking time off my education or career to help care for my ailing grandpa (who was already being cared for). He invited me to his family’s apartment for dinner and then badgered me every day after to let him come see the dorms where the students from our program were housed, telling me I was a really inhospitable person to come to dinner at his apartment and then not let him visit mine. He kept talking inappropriately even when he wasn’t guilt-tripping me. It happened mostly in his office but even in the communal lab. He made all sorts of disgusting comments about his sex life with his wife, graphic things that made me worry he had raped her or that he was a pedophile (or both). He was unconcerned by my discomfort and would keep criticizing my boundaries and perspective, telling me “you think you’re always right,” as if he couldn’t quite grasp that I was the authority and guard of my own body.</p>
<p>I finished the program but felt horrible afterward. I went back to my undergraduate university in a state of deep depression and humiliation, and I started losing weight. He kept calling me, requesting more help with his manuscript. I ended up writing most of the manuscript. I had expected he would edit it and make it more professional, but when it got published, I was surprised to see that it contained mostly my wording – he hadn’t done much on it at all. Even worse, the figures he had complained so righteously about remained in the final publication.</p>
<p>While conducting experiments, I had needed a high-precision ruler and he had refused to order one. In a time crunch, I resorted to printing a ruler scale on the lab printer and using it to track distances in the experiment. The precision of the ruler was obviously somewhat low given that I used a standard-issue printer, but it was high enough to provide suitable accuracy for observing the scale of movement present in the experiment. I kept hoping that he would break down and order the ruler from whatever lab supply site he generally used, but he insisted on sitting around and complaining about me instead, so the final publication featured photographs in which the paper ruler was prominent.</p>
<p>Even after I stopped working in that lab, he would continue to contact me and request that I continue writing the paper, even though I had just worked in the lab as an undergraduate without much formal training. He kept contacting me for almost three years after I left the lab, each time badgering me with requests and long diatribes about his feelings that made me feel guilty and ashamed for wanting to move on with my life and maintain my boundaries. It took me years of therapy to regain my sense of self and the sense of safety required for me to be capable of expressing emotions.</p>
<p>Years later, I can look back and take stock of the situation I was placed in by deciding to participate in a federally-funded program that did not have adequate administrative oversight. My experience damaged my ability to contribute to the field of science and my trust in academia. It dissuaded me from following my intended trajectory after university. And it would have been far less likely to happen had the program made its expectations clearer for all participants: students, advisors, mentors, and administrators.</p>
<p>Inspired by the #MeToo movement, I recently decided to give feedback both to the program and to the funding organization. I think this is what will ultimately help us move through the #MeToo pipeline constructively: giving feedback to organizations and funders is the next step in shining light on the structural issues inherent in academia and STEM that allow abuse to flourish in those environments. Once the structural issues are exposed, the responsible parties can work to hold themselves accountable and create a stronger foundation to allow us to pursue what we are ultimately there for, be it STEM, academia generally, or some other calling.</p>

<p>A hybrid system is a dynamic system that exhibits both continuous and discrete behaviour, and the number of its dimensions is determined by the number of the continuous variables. The hybrid system paradigm is a useful tool for describing a wide range of real-world applications. Examples come from robotics, avionics, biological networks, chemical processes, etc. Most of the hybrid systems are safety critical. Formally, verifying safety properties of hybrid systems consists of construction of a set of reachable states and checking whether this set intersects with a set of unsafe states. Therefore, one of the most fundamental problems in the analysis of hybrid systems is the reachability problem. The reachability problem is known for being difficult, and it is only decidable for special kinds of hybrid systems. Even though many attempts have been made to define the boundary between decidable and undecidable hybrid systems, it is far from being resolved. Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider defined some classes of low dimensional hybrid systems lying on the boundary between decidable and undecidable systems in their seminal paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0890540112000028/1-s2.0-S0890540112000028-main.pdf?_tid=9f466a86-e73b-4b4c-9dd9-84ef605373a7&amp;acdnat=1552504249_aa972217ec2e75d11dcc518467361ca5">Low dimensional hybrid systems – decidable, undecidable, don’t know (Asarin et al., 2012)</a>", and for which decidability is unknown. In this talk, Olga will present an overview of the area and discuss the recent work on the decidability of reachability for a class of hybrid systems due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/12/making-use-of-administrative-resources-at-your-school/">Making use of administrative resources at your school</a></h4>

<p>Last post we discussed creating a personal support system as part of a broader success framework to provide students structure when they leave home for the first time. Today we’ll finish the discussion with a quick note about administrative resources commonly available at schools.</p>
<h4>Administrative Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ombudsman or campus-level resources
<ul>
<li>First, find the contact info for your school’s ombudsman and plug it into your phone. If your school doesn’t have an ombudsman, seek out an administrative official or faculty mentor who would be willing to answer any questions you have about the school’s resources. Ombudsmen are a useful starting point for almost any problem you may have in a university context, because they provide free, flexible, and confidential support and can direct you to the most appropriate campus resource for solving any problem you may have. They can also aid you in figuring out how to provide feedback to other campus departments and resources if they fail to meet your needs.</li>
<li>If you find yourself needing to use administrative resources, make sure to document your interactions with them and continue the interaction until you are satisfied that your concern has been understood, even if it means having to give feedback to the administrative resource about your dissatisfaction with their service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentors
<ul>
<li>Join a peer mentorship program associated with your major, department, intended profession, or identity. A program that provides occasional events for you and your mentor to interact is great.</li>
<li>You and your mentor should also plan to meet about once a month to make sure you build the supportive relationship necessary to maintain the mentorship dynamic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Giving feedback
<ul>
<li>For any of the resources made available by your university or its health center, feel empowered to initiate a discussion or provide feedback if the resource is not helping you as you had hoped.</li>
<li>If you are unsure where to direct feedback, the ombudsman or faculty member should be able to suggest the appropriate venue. It’s important to let the administrative resources know what works or doesn’t work for you, since they exist for that purpose. They may also be able to suggest alternative supports or resources that can better assist you. Those types of conversations will also help you develop your sense of responsibility, self, and accountability because you will gain a better understanding of what is under your control and what expectations are reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being prepared for crises
<ul>
<li>Make sure to have the following numbers programmed into your cell phone in case you need them:
<ul>
<li>Campus police or the nearest off-campus police station</li>
<li>Rape crisis center on or near campus</li>
<li>Counseling center</li>
<li>Student health center or your primary care doctor</li>
<li>Suicide prevention hotline</li>
<li>Domestic violence hotline</li>
<li>Poison Control hotline</li>
<li>Any other numbers listed on the back of your student ID card</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most important – don’t be afraid to call these numbers. That’s what they’re there for!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>These are just a few ideas for making use of the administrative resources at your school. What other ideas do you have?</p>

"Foreign Accent Syndrome" (FAS) is a rare disorder in which patients start to speak with a foreign or regional tone. This striking condition is often associated with brain damage, such as stroke. Presumably, the lesion affects the neural pathways by which the brain controls the tongue and vocal cords, thus producing a strange sounding speech.



Yet there may be more to FAS than meets the eye (or ear). According to a new paper  in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, many o

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/07/ideas-for-creating-a-personal-support-system-in-college/">Ideas for creating a personal support system in college</a></h4>

<p>Last post we discussed the importance of creating a personal success framework after you leave home. The idea of this framework is that it can serve as a structure to help you transition from being a child of your parents to being a grown adult with your own internal value and support structure. This post, we’ll explore some options for creating a personal support system to hold you accountable for the values and organizations to which you aspire.</p>
<p>Although this project is really meant for everyone who eventually leaves their parents’ house, here I am focusing specifically on students attending university for the first time. Over your first semester or first two quarters of university, you may wish to take some or all of these steps to create the system you need to weather the stress of university and to grow into the adult you want to become. By creating your support system, you can reduce the risk of having to experience one of the situations associated with the negative statements above and increase the likelihood of having a positive, constructive college experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Personal Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Professional counseling
<ul>
<li>First, find the right counselor. When you first get to college, and hopefully before you need it, make an appointment with a licensed counselor at your school’s health or counseling center. Most schools have these resources and make them available for free or a low cost to students. Make an appointment and discuss your goals or whatever is on your mind. While there, figure out if you feel comfortable with this counselor and would find them helpful to navigate a difficult time in your life. If not, schedule another appointment at a later date with a different counselor until you find one you can get along with.</li>
<li>Stay in touch with that counselor. Try to schedule an appointment with the counselor at least once a semester or quarter. That way you can maintain your relationship with them and they can get a baseline idea of your personality.</li>
<li>Reach out to the counselor during any crisis situation. Make an appointment with the counselor as soon as you safely can after experiencing any type of crisis (social, medical, emotional) to debrief and figure out if there are any more steps you may wish to take for your own benefit or recovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Friend group
<ul>
<li>Make friends across a variety of common interests, values, or activities. This will usually happen organically for students in college, so if it doesn’t happen for you in a reasonable time period, consider discussing that with a counselor.</li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one friend in each friend group who you are comfortable discussing difficult personal topics with. If you don’t have a friend of that closeness in one of your groups, consider whether you want to remain in that activity or group.</li>
<li>Consider joining or creating a peer support group, either through an established program in your college or as part of a spiritual or religious group or as an informal group of people working towards a shared group goal or tackling a common personal goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your community of origin
<ul>
<li>Find an older university student who also attended your high school and meet with them at least once during your freshman year to get their take on how the culture of your high school and college differ</li>
<li>Stay in regular contact with a role model, teacher, coach, or other positive influence from your home community, at least until you have developed a robust social support network at your university.</li>
<li>Intentionally set video chat or phone dates to stay in contact with your closest high school friends while away at university so that the friendships don’t settle into a texting-only dynamic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your self
<ul>
<li>Writing is a good way to make use of your own internal resources and to create resources for yourself in the event of a crisis. You may wish to keep a private journal (online or pen-and-ink) or a blog that is public or accessible to certain people or groups</li>
<li>Using a journal you can write about current events, your own life and feelings, and how you solve problems that come up for you</li>
<li>It is also a good idea to document problem events or incidents that occur in your life, whether you choose to do anything else about them or not (any stalking, harassment, discrimination, or bullying by other students, faculty, or others)</li>
<li>If you later realize that you have become disconnected from yourself, unduly influenced by peers or groups with values that are incompatible to yours, or if you need to recover your sense of self after a traumatic event, rereading your previous journal entries may help you. In the best case scenario, you’ll end up with a record of your social activities that can later be enjoyable to look back on and see how you spent your time having fun in college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Community Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Your new community
<ul>
<li>Consider joining a spiritual, religious, or club focused on personal growth</li>
<li>Be mindful of the size of your major and department – smaller departments can provide a family-like experience but your experience is also much more dependent on the individual personalities of the peers in your department, making it more important for you to seek strong faculty mentorship and support. Larger departments afford more opportunities to build a selective peer network and more variability in the composition of the required classes you must take.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next post, we’ll list ideas for finding and using the administrative resources available to you at your university. What other ideas do you have for building a personal success framework?</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189524"><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></a> is the most iconic of all mental illnesses but both its conceptualization and causes remain elusive. The popular image portrays patients convinced of being persecuted and hearing voices that nobody else can hear. In reality this complex brain disorder presents an endless variety of psychotic (delusions and hallucinations) and non-psychotic symptoms. This complexity is at the heart of a century-long debate about whether schizophrenia is a single illness or should be conceptualized as a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189524"><strong>syndrome,</strong></a> like dementia, in which different illnesses present common symptoms but have different causes.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/142/1/220/5144594?redirectedFrom=fulltext"><strong>One important case to look at when considering the origins of schizophrenia is that of Vaslav Nijinsky</strong></a> (1890-1950), the most talented ballet dancer in history, who was diagnosed one hundred years ago.</p><p>His biography resembles a novel, filled with drama, anecdotes, and controversies.

For instance, as Russian national, he was under house arrest in Budapest during the First World War.

He continued to suffer from disruptive delusions and hallucinations, however.

The towering figure in psychiatric history assessed the world-famous dancer at the Burghölzli, an asylum near Zurich. Bleuler concluded, “intelligence evidently very good in the past, now he is a confused schizophrenic with mild manic excitement.” Nijinsky was just 30 years old and was never to recover.</p><div><figure><img height="744" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Eugen_bleuler-493x744.jpg" width="493" /><em>Prof. Eugen Bleuler, circa 1900. Image credit: Eugen Bleuler by The National Library of Medicine.

The majority of the time he was either catatonic or displayed disorganized speech and behaviour. Some of the most renowned psychiatrists of the age—including Ludwig Binswanger, Carl Jung, Nobel Prize winner Julius Wagner-Jauregg, Alfred <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7018450"><strong>Adler</strong></a>, and Manfred <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Manfred-J-Sakel"><strong>Sakel</strong></a> —treated Nijinsky, with little success. Nijinsky had barely any symptom-free periods.  During the Second World War, Nijinsky narrowly escaped the Nazi program for eradicating patients with mental illness by hiding in a cave. He finally died of kidney failure in London at the age of 60.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62036-X/fulltext"><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></a> is currently conceptualized as a disorder in which genetic and early-in-life stressors affects the brain development (the so-called neurodevelopmental hypothesis). Subtle cognitive, social, and motor impairments act as silent markers of the disease during childhood, albeit psychosis will emerge after adolescence, when the illness is diagnosed.</p><p>Understanding Nijinsky’s case only under this neurodevelopmental prism is challenging, however. As a child he was prodigiously balanced, with formidable strength and harmonic movements. His case does not fit with the neurological soft-signs and subtle motor abnormalities that are signs of neurodevelopmental problems.  Indeed, Nijinsky’s biography is filled with tragic events, including repeated physical and sexual abuse before psychosis onset, crudely reported in his diaries. Such traumatic experiences are considered major risk factors for developing psychosis and schizophrenia. Nijinsky’s case might be an iconic case of this group of patients in which trauma is present later in life and not directly related to early neurodevelopmental factors. Unravelling the mechanisms by which trauma is associated to schizophrenia remains a challenge.</p><p>Intriguingly, Bleuler was among the first to advocate for a syndrome approach for the disorder. Dementia praecox, the old term for schizophrenia, was first proposed by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emil-Kraepelin"><strong>Emil Kraepelin</strong></a>, after grouping three independent illnesses (paranoia, catatonia and hebephrenia) into a single category or clinical entity. It was Bleuler who in 1911 coined the term schizophrenias, in plural, to highlight the likely different causes for the disorder. The attempts to differentiate schizophrenia subtypes based in clinical features have failed, however, due to poor reliability and frequent overlap between subtypes.

<p>Upon wishing my students a fruitful end to their college-application season, I thought back to that time in my own life. I began to consider what is really important for a successful college career versus what I thought would be important when I was applying to university. There are the things we assume will be key to our success: going to a prestigious school, picking a solid major with a clear career path associated with it, getting a good summer internship.</p>
<p>But there are so many unknowns, which is one of the beautiful parts of going to university. The possibilities seem endless and it’s hard to top that feeling of unlimited potential that imbues the manicured landscape of your new home when you set foot on campus for the first time.</p>
<p>But all those opportunities and unpredictability mean that you don’t really know if, a few years from now when you are lining up for commencement, you will be following your original dream or taking a different career path. You don’t know how long you will remain in your first career. Or what revelations or other life-altering experiences you may have during your college education, that could radically shift your values or priorities. Or what people or significant others you will hopefully meet.</p>
<p>All of these important and inevitable adventures aside, there is another aspect of university that we sometimes don’t consider consciously and deliberately, but that is just as important. Moving away from home is, for most of us, our first significant opportunity to be independent from our parents long enough to mature into a functioning adult.</p>
<p>Ambling through campus on any given day, the word “adult” can feel far away in time and atmosphere from college life. But it is already there on your personal horizon – the responsibility for keeping yourself healthy, the accountability to yourself and others to succeed in class and other activities. University is an opportunity to form and solidify your independent self with your own morals, values, and life outlook.</p>
<p>It is also a time when you’ll be introduced to hundreds of people with varying life outlooks, and when you will join or consort with a variety of groups and communities that have different values, social etiquette, and cultures. With all of this possibility and variability, chances are that at some point, the following will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will fall short of your own expectations in a big way</li>
<li>You will fall short of someone else’s expectations in a way that is significant to them</li>
<li>Someone else will seriously disappoint your expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>When this happens, you have an opportunity to compare your expectations, their expectations, and the stated expectations of your campus community. Questions may arise in your mind: were those expectations reasonable? Where did they come from? You can learn a lot about yourself, your culture, and your values from these experiences.</p>
<p>However, there is also the matter the unmet expectations themselves. These situations can be destabilizing, even traumatic. When they happen during your transition to adult independence, these occurrences can have an unhealthy effect on your outlook or personal growth if you don’t have the resources to process them and learn from them.</p>
<p>I had an experience where I fell far short of my own expectations, and it haunted me for years afterward. What could have been an uncomfortable opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values instead became a nuisance burden of shame that I carried about, inhibiting my own conception of myself as a competent adult.</p>
<p>The trouble began towards the end of my sophomore year. I had been serving as secretary of a student organization for the year and had put in my name to run for president of that organization the following year. It was one of those national organizations with student branches on most college campuses and it was affiliated with my major.</p>
<p>At the time I was running, the voting population of the organization was a bit ambiguous to me: was it the dues-paying members who made our activities possible, or was it the students of that major, for whom we designed and targeted our activities? If I had thought to read the bylaws of our student organization I would have found a good answer, but I didn’t. The outgoing president had a list of email addresses that he said corresponded to all the current students in the major. He would submit that list to the online election app so that all the students would have an opportunity to vote for the club’s next year of leadership, which is how the elections were usually run.</p>
<p>However, a couple weeks before he was to submit the list, he made an offhand joke about padding the list with some extra emails to sway the election because so many of the upperclassmen had a problem with the person running against me and because he felt that she had bribed the freshman class by stopping by their morning lecture with a big box of donuts. I told him not to do that and he moved onto another topic of conversation. I thought it was a joke that I had heard the end of. It wasn’t until several weeks after the election that I found out he was serious. He announced in a leadership meeting that he had padded the vote and told us not to speak of it to anyone. When I asked how many votes he had added and found out that his padding was what won me the election, I was disappointed and ashamed. I felt personally responsible that he had done such a thing and that my voice seemed not to matter.</p>
<p>But my own reaction made the situation much worse. <span>My initial reaction was to feel unworthy of respect, given that he had already intentionally disrespected my stated value that he not interfere with the election and that he was now telling me to stay silent because my opinion still didn’t matter (to him). I felt ashamed of what he had done and afraid to discuss it with the faculty sponsor of our organization, who – from my isolated vantage point – seemed distant and uninterested. I had experienced some harassment over that school year and I became diffusely afraid of what would happen if I stuck up for myself by publicly ceding the election. And ashamed of being thought a troublemaker if I took time away from the faculty by asking them for advice on how to handle the situation.</span></p>
<p>This event could have been an opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values, except that I couldn’t even get my own mind right. The other folks in my major just seemed relieved that my opponent had lost and my roommate seemed annoyed with me for even bringing up my problem. In retrospect, there were at least three ways that I could have personally resolved the moral dilemma and secured support for myself to weather any resulting criticism or harassment. But I didn’t know where to turn for the initial supportive brainstorming and discussion that I needed in order to act according to my idealized priorities.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a support system in place, and so I didn’t get the benefit of this trial life threw my way. Instead, I served the next year as if I had won, except that I subordinated myself to the vice president (who had run as the mate of the student who should have won), figuring that he had more of a mandate than I did for how we allocated our money and time in service of the students. And I carried a little ball of shame during that year and after for becoming part of a corrupt situation by not speaking out. It was a cowardly response and therefore did nothing for my confidence or progression to becoming a responsible adult.</p>
<p>How can you ensure that you benefit from these trials as you navigate your college experience toward an adult self? By ensuring you have the resources and confidence to live according to your desired values. Create a multi-layered support and mentoring system for yourself that grows with your throughout your years in university. You can start right when you get to university by taking a few steps that I’ll outline in my next post. And every semester or year, you can take inventory of your support network and update it as needed. Watch for my next post, about creating your personal support system, and a follow up post about accessing support from the administrative resources provided by your university.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryohei Yasuda of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has received a grant by the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH. The award is for $2.9 million over 5 years and will continue the funding of Yasuda’s work with Rab proteins.</p>
<p>Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, Dr. Yasuda is studying Rab proteins’ impact on learning and memory by tracking how molecules become activated and interact with each other. By better understanding how these proteins communicate with each other, scientists may one day be able to develop interventions for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and other brain disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda is a Scientific Director of MPFI and leads the Neuronal Signal Transduction Lab. He has received many recognitions for his outstanding research in neuroscience, including the 2015 National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Pioneer Award, which recognizes scientists demonstrating creativity and groundbreaking approaches in biomedical or behavioral science. Dr. Yasuda was one of only 13 scientists in the country to receive the NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.</p>
<p>Additional awards include the Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the New Investigator Award from the Alzheimer’s Association, and Research Award for Innovative Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda received his PhD in Physics in 1998 from Keio University Graduate School of Science and Technology in Yokohama, Japan. In his PhD studies, he demonstrated that the enzyme ATP synthase is a rotary motor made of single molecule and that its energy conversion efficiency is close to 100%. From 2000 to 2005, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he built an imaging device to monitor protein interactions in living cells with high sensitivity and resolution. From 2005 to 2012, he was an assistant professor of the Neurobiology department at the Duke University Medical Center where he developed a number of techniques to visualize signaling activity in single synapses. From 2009 to 2012, Dr. Yasuda served as an Early Career Scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute before coming to MPFI in 2012.</p>

<p>Sam Sutton's journal club session, where he will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8094937">ASP, Learning to Forget With Adaptive Synaptic Plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks (Panda et al., 2018)</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A fundamental feature of learning in animals is the “ability to forget” that allows an organism to perceive, model, and make decisions from disparate streams of information and adapt to changing environments. Against this backdrop, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) for improved recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) for real time online learning in a dynamic environment. We incorporate an adaptive weight decay mechanism with the traditional spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning to model adaptivity in SNNs. The leak rate of the synaptic weights is modulated based on the temporal correlation between the spiking patterns of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This mechanism helps in gradual forgetting of insignificant data while retaining significant, yet old, information. ASP, thus, maintains a balance between forgetting and immediate learning to construct a stable-plastic self-adaptive SNN for continuously changing inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed learning methodology addresses catastrophic forgetting, while yielding significantly improved accuracy over the conventional STDP learning method for digit recognition applications. In addition, we observe that the proposed learning model automatically encodes selective attention toward relevant features in the input data, while eliminating the influence of background noise (or denoising) further improving the robustness of the ASP learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/26/advance-your-ability-to-account/">Advance your ability to account</a></h4>

<p>This post is the third in a mini-series about <a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/14/constructing-solutions-from-hard-times/">making use of difficult times</a>. First, we discussed <a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/19/dealings-with-feelings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">handling the difficult feelings</a> that can arise. Next, we talked about<a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/22/the-key-to-world-peace-your-personal-opinion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> limiting your scope of information intake</a> and forming your own researched opinion about things that are really important to you. To wrap up, let’s talk about accountability. As in, how do you account for your own and other peoples’ contributions to a situation?</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how to hold people accountable unless it’s modeled for you or you have training. Even something as uncomplicated as how to hold your own self accountable can be difficult. I’m operating with the assumption that most people want to be accountable to themselves and their communities. And most of the time, I think we are accountable, well enough that no mention is made of it and no thought is given to it.</p>
<h4>Accountability to Self</h4>
<p>But wait – how many times recently have you thought of your own behavior (or lack of it), “I really <em>should</em> do . . .” So perhaps being accountable to ourselves is somewhat difficult. People who have thought about this problem much more often and smartly say to set up your environment so that your ideal behavior arises naturally from it. Make your desired behavior the easiest thing to do. Make it the course of action that requires the least amount of thought. As an example, check out <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/#philosophy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt Might’s blog entry</a> about doing pullups regularly to gain muscle strength. He applies the same philosophy to bulking up, losing weight, and working efficiently. It basically amounts to putting in the thought, time, and money up front to radically restructure your environment so that it prompts you to default to your desired behavior.</p>
<p>He also discusses measuring, tracking, and reporting outcomes of your behavior. For the projects he mentions in his blog, this could mean counting calories, weighing yourself, or measuring your waistline. Getting regular feedback from an objective, quantified source about effects of your behavior. Charting your progress over time to see how well your environment is working for you.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that there are four components to Dr. Might’s method of holding oneself accountable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining the goal or desired behavior. The definition must be clear and precise, so that you can track your performance and be confident about whether or not you are meeting your goal.</li>
<li>Setting up your environment so that the desired behavior is the easiest and most natural of all possible choices. That means removing obstacles to the behavior (or confronting limiting fears about engaging in the behavior). And it also means erecting barriers or linking negative outcomes to the other, undesired behaviors.</li>
<li>Going about your daily life without putting unnecessary or repetitive thought into it. Being an academic, Matt Might likes to reserve his thinking resources for original thoughts in service of his field of study. But this thriftiness is probably what makes his strategy so durable – most people want to avoid the exhaustion of needlessly taxing their mental resources.</li>
<li>Regularly receiving objective, quantified feedback about how well you are meeting your goal or the progress you are making toward it. This component assumes you’ve already set up some sort of tracking or logging system, presumably as part of your environmental structuring described above. Now you would be assessing your performance regularly, which will let you know whether your environmental design is working for you or whether you need to make changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this system can work for quantifiable goals where the criteria are objective, the tracking of them is not subject to significant bias, and the tracking can be done by yourself. However, it’s possible to have all these components in place and still fail. For example, if something about the environment gets derailed, it can distract you or thwart your goal. And even if you are tracking your progress, you may find yourself carefully and precisely tracking how you routinely fail to progress toward your goal. So what next?</p>
<h4><strong>Accountability to Others</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s talk about accountability to others. There are several scenarios where we may be accountable to others, ranging from behaviors that directly affect them to goals that aren’t related to them at all. As an example of the latter, let’s continue with our scenario from above. What can you do if you’ve set up your environment to encourage your desired behavior and have tracked your progress faithfully only to find you’re nowhere near your goal?</p>
<p>Having a friend to whom you answer can help with your motivation. It may also provide an opportunity for your friend to informally coach you as you check in about your activity and what factors influence the chances of you meeting your goal each day (or period between check-ins). And, if your friend has a similar personal goal, you may choose to work side-by-side for some goals, making the experience more fun.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve talked about involving someone of your choice, voluntarily, in holding you accountable for a behavior that doesn’t necessarily matter to them. They may care about it for your sake, but if you fail to meet your goal, it’s not going to have much of an effect on them. What I really want to focus on in this section is something a bit more complicated: being accountable to others for behavior that affects them, for which they are far more likely to care about.</p>
<p>The four points above, as discussed for personal goals that don’t involve other people, will be slightly altered in this section to accommodate the necessary interpersonal dynamics.</p>
<p>The first component, defining the goal or desired behavior, may arise out of the expectations of any of the involved persons. I would already have expectations of myself, for how I treat other people or behave around them. These expectations would be based on my values, my environment, my perception of my role in relation to the other persons. The other person would also have expectations of me, also based on our environment, their culture, their knowledge of my culture, their perception of our roles in the context of our relationship. Our mutual expectations may align well without overt discussion, or perhaps we would take an opportunity early in our relationship to define them. If we met in the context of a formal group, the group may provide expectations or may create a defined opportunity for us to set expectations.</p>
<p>Setting up the environment to encourage the desired behavior or relationship dynamics may be more complicated in this situation. Although, if you are part of a formal group or other structure, they may already provide some of that – regular meetings, resources, a work environment, etc. Plus the motivation to visit that environment or use those resources regularly – a salary, acknowledgement, social connection, etc.</p>
<p>The last component, tracking progress or getting feedback, can be more subjective and difficult to implement constructively. It can get us into trouble in ways that just don’t happen when we track our independent goals – like the difference between stepping on a weigh scale and conducting an annual performance review.</p>
<p>In structured groups such as a workplace or lab, it makes sense to institute a formal goal-setting and feedback-giving &amp; receiving routine. This is standard procedure in corporate environments, which often also train their employees in how to conduct these routines constructively.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in five different academic labs as well as one corporation, and I never experienced anything remotely similar to that in academia. I imagine that the administrative levels do and that specific labs might, but I haven’t been aware of resources or encouragement of specific labs to do that nor of a way for the administration or the higher levels of academia to create a standard mechanism for the students to participate in this at the level of, say, their department or school (except for unions, which some schools have and which do sometimes create feedback opportunities, and faculty meetings where specific student reps are named, invited, and supported – but other students are not always aware of the governance nor the way to operate within the structure to give and receive feedback). I consider this a cultural issue with serious implications for the health of academia, which we’ll cover more in a future post.</p>
<p>In other situations or in less formal arrangements such as a roommate chore sheet or a team agreement about workout routines, it makes sense to agree on a “check-in” routine to track progress and possibly also a date at which to review whether the goal or arrangement still makes sense. Start with an informal, verbal agreement for lower-stakes behaviors. For ideas about giving and receiving feedback smoothly, there are many books that can help, including Marshall Rosenberg’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdeYx8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nonviolent Communication</a>, as well as several books written by members of the Harvard Negotiation Project, including <a href="https://amzn.to/2UEnSdN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Getting to Yes</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UAPoZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanks for the Feedback</a>.</p>
<h4>Accountability to the Past</h4>
<p>This part is related to accountability to yourself. It’s takes the concepts of accountability we discussed above and relates it back to what prompted this post in the first place – how we can get the best out of difficult situations and grow from them. Once we have dealt with the feelings arising from them and formed our opinion based on our experience and any research or deep-diving we did according to our own values and priorities, what do we do next?</p>
<p>It’s worth contemplating what made the situation difficult – did it reveal something about our own values or attitudes that we now want to change, or did it involve a difficult person who we just can’t avoid, or was it indicative of some entrenched problem that seems unsolvable or out of our control? One can mine the situation for motivation to change or grow in some way, or perhaps to develop a personal mission or adjust our values and priorities. Formal teams or organizations often do a “lessons learned” exercise after these situations are discovered, in which they analyze each person or party’s contribution to the situation and determine whether new policies need to be added (or existing ones altered) to prevent the situation from recurring.</p>
<p>You can do this individually for difficult situations in your life as well. Do it soon after the situation if you want ideas for personal policies or routines that you wish to change. Give it some distance (in time and context) if you want are looking to change your values, perspective, or if you want to use the difficulty to as some sort of calling in life. Just remember, when looking back on distant situations that give you cause for regret, that the you in that situation is not the you thinking about it now. You can’t recreate your mind at the time with the mind you have now – the limited information and experience you had back then versus all the new research and living you’ve done since the event occurred. So remember not to be too hard on your past self – given your limitations at the time, there probably wasn’t much else you could have done. If you can look back on a distant situation in the past with horror or shock at how badly you navigated it, that is one way of marking how much progress you have made since then in educating yourself or realigning your values. If you make it through both the nearsighted and farsighted forms of analysis and are still feeling moved by some aspect of your experience, it’s more likely to be a legitimate calling for you.</p>
<p>For all of these forms of accountability – to yourself, to others, to your past – it can be a source of real growth if taken seriously. And if you are able to separate your view of yourself from your view of your behavior, it can even be enjoyable.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9848">The Cancer Personality Scandal (Part 1)</a></h4>

The Journal of Health Psychology has just published an extraordinary pair of papers that call for a new inquiry into a 30-year old case of probable scientific fraud.

According to Anthony J. Pelosi, author of the main paper, the case was "one of the worst scientific scandals of all time" and yet has never been formally investigated. The journal's editor, David F. Marks, agrees and, in an editorial, also calls for the retraction or correction of up to 61 papers.

<h2>Ageing in harmony: why the third act of life should be musical</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-macritchie-171595">Jennifer MacRitchie</a>, <em><a href="http://theconversation.com/institutions/western-sydney-university-1092">Western Sydney University</a></em></p>
<p>It’s never too late to pick up a musical instrument. In fact, there are many reasons why it’s a great idea, particularly in old age.</p>
<p>We normally hear about reasons to increase music education for children, and for good cause. There are <a href="http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/28/3/269">many cognitive and social benefits</a> to playing an instrument that aid a child’s development. Consequently, as an older adult, there are long-term effects of having taken part in these musical activities, as it can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463047">limit cognitive decline</a>.</p>
<p>Even a <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full">small amount of training</a> can have long-lasting effects. But this doesn’t mean that those who have never played an instrument in childhood have missed the boat. The ageing brain is <em>plastic</em>: that means it is able to learn new things all the time. So, should we consider an increase in music programs for those in the third age?</p>
<h2>Playing music as a workout for the brain</h2>
<p>Learning to play a musical instrument is an extremely complex task that involves the coordination of multiple sensory systems within the brain. Many instruments require precise coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands in order to play a musical note. Using the resulting sound as feedback, the brain prepares for the next note and so it continues. The act of music-making is quite a brain workout.</p>
<p>The relationship between the motor and auditory parts of the brain is strengthened when physically playing music. This may explain why adults trained to <em>play</em> certain melodies have an <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/39/9632.long">enhanced representation of music</a> in the brain compared to adults only trained to <em>listen</em> to the same melodies.</p>
<p>As playing music involves many different parts of the brain, even a short-term program for older adult musical novices can lead to generalised improvements for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00810/full">cognitive ability</a>.</p>
<h2>Music as a workout for the fingers</h2>
<p>Learning to play an instrument such as the piano involves many complex finger sequencing and coordination tasks. As such, it can be a great test-bed for learning to move fingers independently.</p>
<p>The creativity of music and the enjoyment people take in playing is particularly important for rehabilitation, as it encourages sustained practice leading ultimately to higher benefits.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a><span class="attribution"><span class="source">Shutterstock</span></span></figure>
<p>It’s thanks to this that piano lessons have been used to successfully retrain hand function for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00662/full">patients who have had a stroke</a>. The immediate auditory feedback from each finger movement is thought to help adults <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721795">reduce errors in movement</a> and work towards moving at a more regular pace.</p>
<p>Music training is an excellent environment to train cognitive and motor abilities, both in the contexts of child development and for rehabilitation. The question for older adults is this: can learning a musical instrument not only put the brakes on cognitive and motor decline but actually allow development of new skills?</p>
<p>Older adults can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1995805/">improve their motor learning</a> – that is, they can improve their rate of learning new things – and the best environments for brain training are ones that are <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00183/full">novel and flexible</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, many activities can be novel such as juggling or knitting, but the advantages of learning an instrument can be found in the breadth of skills required to play. At Western Sydney University, we are currently investigating how piano training can be used with healthy older adults to improve their general hand function in unrelated daily tasks.</p>
<h2>Music for health and wellbeing</h2>
<p>Often, the worry is that playing an instrument will be too difficult for older adults to manage. On the contrary, learning to play an instrument can provide a great sense of <a class="broken_link" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41162324">achievement</a> and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Older adults relish the opportunity to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2014.999361">learn something new</a>.<br />
Cognitive benefits aside, music can also be a great <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02601370.2014.991951">social activity for older adults</a>, facilitating social bonding and decreasing feelings of loneliness or isolation.</p>
<p>Music programs are linked to improvements measured in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005138">markers of the body’s immune system</a> such as the presence of antibodies and vital signs (heart rate/blood pressure).</p>
<p>It’s suggested that this is a consequence of decreases in stress that can happen when taking part in musical activities. However, further research is needed to determine exactly how this relationship functions.</p>
<h2>Music for all</h2>
<p>It’s vital to understand how we can aid the current generation of older adults, in terms of both health and personal enjoyment. With the myriad benefits provided by playing a musical instrument, it would seem beneficial to have a wider variety of musical activities on offer to the older generation.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if the third age wasn’t viewed as a final descent from some mid-life peak, but some new act of life that opens up these opportunities? Perhaps we should give older adults the chance to develop in ways they could never have imagined before.</p>
<p>Activities such as singing in a choir, or playing the piano can provide this opportunity, as well as offering many general benefits to health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So whether it’s in independent living, retirement or assisted care, let’s make the third act of life a musical one!<img alt="The Conversation" height="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/57799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" style="border: none !important; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important;" width="1" /></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/22/the-key-to-world-peace-your-personal-opinion/">Design an Information Equilibrium for Inner Peace</a></h4>

<p>You’ve heard it before: the key to peace isn’t in your surroundings or possessions, it’s in your mind. This isn’t a post about mindfulness though, rather a way to use your mind and time to encourage your own agency.  Activating that sense of agency in service of your own values, in a coherent and meaningful way, can provide a sense of calm and stability, and can be brought about relatively quickly, without requiring years of training in a Buddhist monastery. Your own personal thoughts about the events in your world hold the key to this peaceful existence.</p>
<p>It might not look like it yet, but this is actually a post about information overload. What it is and how to avoid it. We already know why it’s important to avoid: maintaining a realistic diet of information intake prevents burnout and helps us stay present and focused in reality.</p>
<p>Most of us feel some responsibility to stay informed of current events. We keep up through a diet of local and global news. On TV, news sites, and social media, we stay up-to-date on the happenings in our neighborhoods, friend and peer circles, alumni or school networks, cities, countries, and world. And we can spend hours every day doing this, to the detriment of our jobs and home duties, our families and our concentration.</p>
<p>Self-help sites suggest formulas or tools for maintaining a balance of information intake. But what it really comes down to is this: which information is actually going to change your behavior or perspective? Because that’s the information worth spending time and attention on.</p>
<p>If you vote in federal or state elections, that’s a good reason to stay up-to-date on national and world news. If you lobby your members of Congress or vote in local elections, that’s a good reason to stay current on more local news. If you travel abroad, donate to international charities, or like to discuss world events with your friends, those are good reasons to keep up with headlines and international news. If you have or desire a career in a particular field, it’s a good idea to keep up with the news related to your field and to any potential vendors or clients. But if all those stories just worry you and you’ve never done anything about them and never plan to, that’s not the most effective use of your time.</p>
<p>The same goes for social media – if you have real life relationships to maintain or a brand to sustain, or if you need to be aware of the online climate in your social network for some other reason, it makes sense to spend some time online to complement your real-life connections. But if you find yourself spending a lot of time staying up-to-date with people you never talk to in real life and will probably never see again in person, that’s another route to information overload.</p>
<p>One can argue that a minimal level of attention to these additional news sources is necessary to maintain an ambient awareness of your surroundings. I certainly subscribe to that view. So I don’t know what the best ratio is, as long as most of your information intake consist of news about people or things that you have some influence over or some passion about, some way to contribute.  And if you really must spend time consuming news or opinion pieces or community gossip for which you have no forseeable use, at least write about your own opinion of it in a personal journal occasionally. Better to be a motivated participant in the stories that receive so much of your attention than an ineffectual bystander.</p>
<p>Think about all the time you’ve spent reading or hearing stories that generate a lot of feelings. Now consider how you have acted on those feelings – did it give you confidence about how to vote, or inspire you to spend your time differently, or motivate you to communicate with someone? If you can increase the return on your investment of feelings and time by acting constructively on what you consume (and reduce the fruitless consumption of information), the better for your mental health and sense of peace. If the time you spend reading news is also directly preparing you to act in your life, there’s not so much burnout. You’ll feel more effective and valuable.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to form your own opinions more readily. Rather than having a diffuse understanding of current events, you’ll have a multi-level appreciation of the stories you do know. The broader perspective can be combined with your own first-hand experience and analysis to generate a unique personal opinion that is yours to share and debate. You’ll be less likely to contribute to rumor mills and internet shaming, more likely to have spent time reading about a subject that’s actually worth your while. The extra time freed up by whittling down your news sources can be used to dive deep into the stories that really interest you.</p>
<p>This strategy can make you a better conversationalist and also a more valuable voice in the conversation. By owning your interests and opinions in current events, you’ll increase your credibility with others and your confidence with yourself. Here’s an exercise you can try to help make this shift in your own life. Over the course of a whole day, take note of the scope and quality of the information you take in, as well as what actions or other significant changes that information adds to your life or environment. If you find that you’re sinking a lot of time into an unrewarding source of information, find an alternative way to spend that time. You’ll probably feel better about yourself and your world.</p>

<p>This is my impression of my information pipeline. This is the simplified version, meant to show that information should be processed and kept on the move. There are any number of output pipes and branching systems. The key here is to keep content out of the holding tank at the bottom. Venting it is annoying if you’re not into exercise. The key is, don’t pay too much attention or thought to any given feeling unless you have something good to do about it. If information is causing a backup in the pipeline because it generates a lot of feelings or thoughts but there’s no output for it, either you have to reconfigure the pipeline if you plan for more of those type to come through, or you gotta prevent that sort of information from getting into your pipeline in the first place:</p>

<p>Volker Steuber's journal club session, where he will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this talk, Volker will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding. Volker will focus on temporal coding and summarise John Hopfield's (1995) suggestion how neurons with subthreshold oscillations in their membrane potential could perform scale-invariant temporal encoding of input patterns (and which conditions have to be met for the encoding  to be scale invariant). However, temporal coding is sensitive to noise, and Volker will describe the rank order decoding scheme that was suggested by Simon Thorpe (1998) in order to provide robustness against noise. Furthermore, Volker will outline how Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex could implement a form of rank-order decoding of temporal parallel fibre input patterns.</p>
<p>Volker will reference the following papers:</p>
