<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/basel-3800578_1920-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The annual international conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular biology (ISMB) is the flagship meeting for the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). The European conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) is a major bioinformatics and computational biology meeting which is held jointly with the ISMB meeting every two years. Together, ISMB/ECCB brings together people from the fields of computer science, molecular biology, mathematics, statistics and other related fields, showcasing the best and latest developments in bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>
<blockquote><p>The conference is focused on its Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs. There were 20 COSI tracks and workshops present, all representing major research areas in the field of computational biology.</p></blockquote>
<p>ISMBECCB  2019 took place in Basel, Switzerland. In general, the conference is very much focused on its Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs. There were 20 COSI tracks and workshops present at the meeting this year, all representing major research areas in the field of computational biology. Each COSI ran their own sessions (COSI tracks) as part of the conference. There were also a number of Special Sessions, Technology Tracks  and two Special Tracks (on <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/bd2k.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Big Data to Knowledge</a> (BD2K) and <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/elixir.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elixir</a>).</p>
<p>As you can imagine from such a comprehensive, multi-track program, it’s simply not possible to cover everything here. But here is a quick summary of some of the highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Keynote speakers</strong></p>
<p>As is always the case at ISCB conferences, delegates were treated to a number of excellent presentations by some prestigious keynote speakers.</p>
<p>These included <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/n-rajewsky" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikolaus Rajewsky</a>, from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, presenting his work using single-cell approaches to investigate gene regulation in space and time, <a href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Stafford Noble</a>, from the University of Washington, on using machine learning methods to gain insights in complex genomic or proteomic data and <a href="https://lab.dessimoz.org/people/christophe-dessimoz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christophe Dessimoz</a>, who discussed his research on the challenges and rewards of benchmarking.</p>
<p>Rather excitingly, the conference offered <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscblive-streaming-content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live-streaming</a> of all the Distinguished Keynotes for all ISCB members that were not able to attend.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11211 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/20190724_124404-225x300.jpg" width="225" />
<p><strong>Awards</strong></p>
<p>Every year, ISCB <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscb-awards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gives out four awards to recognize specific achievements</a> by researchers in the field.</p>
<p>This year, it included William Stafford Noble, winner of the ISCB Innovator award, who has recently joined the <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em> editorial board as an Associate Editor</p>
<p>Other winners include Bonnie Berger (ISCB Accomplishment by a senior scientist award), Barb Bryant (Outstanding contributions to ISCB award) and Christophe Dessimov (ISCB Overton prize).</p>
<p><strong>Supporting young scientists</strong></p>
<p>But, the meeting wasn’t just about the top scientists in the field. It was  was opened with a one day student symposium, with tutorials on a wide range of topics including interpretability for deep learning models, visualization of large biological data and tools for reproducible research.</p>
<p>There were over 1,100 posters on display at the conference, many from early career researchers, the lively sessions giving young scientists an opportunity to talk about their work;  there were posters from different categories throughout the conference on a very diverse range of topics. Just to give a flavor on what was on display, there were posters on energetic conflicts in the catalytic sites of proteins, <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Sickle Cell Disease Ontology</a>, modeling of immune responses to Clostridium difficile infection, “Nightingale”, which is a library of reusable data visualization components and a number of posters on bioinformatics teaching and teaching resources.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11210 alignright" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/20190724_123934-225x300.jpg" width="225" />
<p>The conference also introduced CompBio Ignite talks, providing researchers not selected for oral presentations the opportunity to give a six-minute so called “lighting style” talk throughout the lunch hour.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the scientific community</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned, the ISMB has a well-established collaboration with a number of Communities of Special Interest (COSIs), including<a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/sysmod.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> SysMod: Computational Modeling of Biological Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/mlcsb.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MLCSB: Machine Learning in Computational and Systems Biology</a> and <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/3dsig.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3DSIG: Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics</a>.</p>
<p>The keynote at the 3DSIG session, presented by Torsten Schwede, from the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, was a celebration of 25 years of the automated protein structure homology-modelling server, SWISS-MODEL, its recent progress and some key lessons have been learned throughout its development.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting talks in the MLCSB COSI session described DrugCell, a “visible” neural network based artificial intelligence that predicts anti-cancer drug responses, taking into account structural features of the drugs themselves as well as the genomic features of the cells affected. The researchers found that the compound that performed best was the drug vincristine, with the neural network highlighting the well-defined pathways affected by the drug, such as cell adhesion and division.</p>
<p>And the SysMod keynote, presented by Trey Ideker, presented the <a href="http://ccmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cancer Map Initiative</a>, the aim of the project being to produce a complete map of the gene and protein wiring diagram of a cancer cell, information that is vital for developing computational models of cancer cells for both basic and clinical research.</p>
<p><strong>Final impressions</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that struck me about this conference was the support given to young researchers, not only in terms of the training program, but also giving them the opportunity to describe their research to a specialized audience and the possibility of networking and setting up collaborations. The field of computational biology is exciting and fast paced and I particularly enjoyed the MLCSB sessions and hearing more about Elixir and the work they do to support some of the field’s most important resources. I look forward to attending the ISMB conference next year, which will be held in Montreal.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Is it possible to spot the signs of future psychopathy in a child? Some researchers have argued that it is <span class="None">— </span>by looking at the child’s level of “interpersonal callousness” (IC), or the extent to which they are manipulative, dishonest, and show a lack of guilt, remorse or distress at being punished. Indeed, previous studies have found that children who rank high for IC are more likely to develop psychopathic features, as well as to commit violent offences in adolescence and adulthood. So, case closed?</span></p>
<p>Not according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-39486-001">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. This work, led by Meagan Docherty and Jordan Beardslee at Arizona State University, suggests that other important risk factors for these negative outcomes in adolescence and adulthood haven’t been properly taken into account — and that when they are, the apparent link between childhood callousness and psychopathy in adulthood disappears.</p>
<p><span id="more-37657"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Docherty and Beardslee’s team analysed data collected for the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), in which boys were regularly interviewed and assessed using a variety of measures, from their early childhood in the late 1980s through to adulthood. The PYS group was deliberately skewed to over-include boys who, based on early problem behaviour, were considered to be at a higher risk of going on to commit serious crimes. The datasets also included any official records of later offending, and the results of follow-up assessments of psychopathic features, physical aggression and antisocial behaviour on into adulthood.</span></p>
<p>The 503 participants included in this study had been rated for callousness each year from the ages of 8 to 15 by their teachers, who assessed their level of agreement with statements like “doesn’t seem to feel guilty after misbehaving.” The team divided the participants into various callousness groups: those deemed to have low, moderate or high IC levels, for example; groups who’d shown callousness only during childhood, or in whom it appeared only in adolescence; and also a group in which IC developed early on and remained high and stable. They then compared this data with levels of psychopathic features (such as being manipulative or antisocial) and physical aggression at age 29, and also, as a measure of antisocial behaviour, official criminal records.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers also took into account a number of potentially confounding factors that might themselves relate to later violent crimes or psychopathy. These included any records of arrests by age 15, and also “externalising” behaviours (physical aggression, verbal bullying and defiance, for example) during adolescence. </span></p>
<p>When these factors were included in the analysis, membership of the various callousness groups during childhood or adolescence did not predict later adult psychopathic features. This means that people who’d been deemed to have high IC as children were no more likely to show signs of psychopathy in adulthood than those who’d had no or low levels of callousness in childhood. “These results suggest that the stability from IC early in life to psychopathic features in adulthood might be overstated in prior studies that do not control for early problem behaviours,” the researchers write.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">There were, though, associations between certain callousness groups and aggression and antisocial behaviour in adolescence and adulthood. Those participants with early-onset, high-level and stable callousness were more likely to be aggressive and to engage in serious violence in adulthood. (Members of this particular IC group were two to three times more likely to be arrested for serious violence than those in any other IC group.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The team says that they would like to see more research into why IC follows distinct patterns in different young people. Perhaps warm parenting can ‘treat’ deficits in moral development, which might appear as symptoms of IC in childhood that vanish by adolescence, for example; in contrast, harsh parenting might encourage the emergence of IC in otherwise typical adolescents. </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9986">The Racism of Carl Jung</a></h4>

The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875-1961) was one of the best-known psychologists of the 20th century. He introduced such famous concepts as introverted and extraverted personalities, and the idea of the psychological 'complex'.



Today, Jungian or analytical psychology retains an active community. But a recently published Open Letter from a number of prominent Jungians points to troubles within the fold.



The letter acknowledges that Jung's writings contained racism, and apologizes for

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><h5>Note: This blog was written by Renee Hoch, Senior Editor, Team Manager for <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s Publication Ethics Editorial team</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integrity of image data in primary research articles has emerged as a major concern in publication ethics. Studies querying the frequency of image concerns have indicated that 4-25% of published research articles in the biomedical and life sciences may include unreported image splicing, duplications, and/or manipulations with potential repercussions for the reliability of the results [1-4]. These issues can stem from honest errors, efforts to beautify or clarify the results, poor data management, poor knowledge as to best practice standards in image data reporting, or fraudulent misrepresentation of experimental results. Whatever the root cause, image integrity issues can damage the reliability of – and public trust in – the scientific literature.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can journals do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now the majority of image concern cases at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been raised post-publication, although some are spotted during peer review. We follow up on such issues regardless of when they are raised, but it would benefit authors, journals, and readers to try to identify and address more of these concerns prior to publication. To this end, as discussed recently at the 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> World Conference on Research Integrity, some journals have implemented dedicated pre-publication image screening; developers are working on software tools to help identify issues such as splicing and duplications; and a group at the Headt Center in Berlin is developing an </span><a href="https://headt.eu/The-Image-Integrity-Database/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Integrity Database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [5] that can be used to test new software tools. Solutions are needed which can be applied at scale within the context of journal checks and/or peer review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are taking a policy-based approach to proactively address image integrity for blot and gel results: we now require that authors submit the underlying raw images to support all blot and gel image data reported in a submission’s figures or supporting information files. The raw data will be assessed during peer review (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or before acceptance (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and if a manuscript is accepted the underlying image data will be published as supporting information or provided via a public data repository. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why require raw blot and gel data?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new policy focuses on blot and gel reporting because these types of  images comprise the most prevalent category of image concerns that our editorial teams handle, and the raw image data underlying these figures are particularly informative in clarifying the reliability of the reported results. Under the new policy, editors and reviewers will have access to the underlying image data before publication so that they can verify the reported results and consider these data when making decisions as to whether the work complies with the journals’ guidelines and publication requirements. With the raw data, editors and reviewers will be better equipped to identify any concerns about these results in the context of peer review, so that authors can address questions about their data and resolve honest data reporting errors prior to publication. With this new policy and the support of our authors, Academic Editors, and reviewers, we aim to strengthen the integrity and reproducibility of our published articles.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(based on</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases resolved 1/2017-5/2019)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new policy will bring our data reporting requirements for blot and gel results into better alignment with PLOS’ and the greater community’s open data-sharing objectives. Since 2014, PLOS’ </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Availability Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has required that authors provide the underlying data supporting an article’s results. For image data, our policy has specified that authors provide “sample” images to support the results, but has not provided clear instructions about our expectations for sample images. One could consider published figure panels to be representative sample images but these rarely include the original image data: images are typically cropped, adjusted, and in some cases manipulated (stretched, spliced, contrast adjusted, etc.) during figure preparation. While such alterations may be acceptable if transparently reported and abiding by best practice standards, they can also lead to questions about a figure’s integrity, make it difficult to assess the results, and in some cases lead to loss of important information such as about reagent specificity or experimental controls. The original data play an essential role in clarifying such issues when raised, but unfortunately authors are often unable to provide these data after publication (Figure 1 and [6]). </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifies our blot/gel image data requirements in detail, and aims to ensure the availability of blot/gel image data after  an article’s publication. We have also updated our </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-reporting-blot-and-gel-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blot/gel reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-preparing-figures-from-image-files"><span style="font-weight: 400;">figure preparation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guidelines to increase awareness of best practices in blot and gel presentation and support transparency in data reporting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sincerely thank all who provided advice on these recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> updates, and we thank our authors in advance for working with us towards these higher image data reporting standards. We appreciate that the new policy may require extra work, but we hope that these efforts will positively impact the integrity and reproducibility of the published record and ultimately benefit the scientific community.</span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>In a world made for right-handed people, life can sometimes be frustrating if you are among the 10% or so who are “adextral” — that is, left-handed or ambidextrous. Now a new grievance can be added to the list. Brain imaging researchers are systematically excluding adextrals from participating in their studies, according to an analysis of recent research papers published in top neuroimaging journals. Yet there’s no good reason to exclude this population, say the authors — and in fact, the practice could be detrimental to research.</p>
<p><span id="more-37652"></span></p>
<p>The tendency to include only right-handed people in neuroimaging research stems from the finding that certain processes are represented differently in the brains of adextrals. In particular, while the left hemisphere of the brain dominates language processing in almost all right-handed people, in about 30% of adextrals this processing occurs predominantly in the right hemisphere (or both hemispheres). Handedness also influences how the brain represents sensation and movement of the hands. Many neuropsychologists have therefore avoided recruiting adextrals for fear of affecting their data.</p>
<p>But Lyam Bailey and colleagues at Dalhousie University noticed that researchers were excluding adextrals from a range of studies unrelated to language or movement, even though there is little evidence that handedness influences other processes. So in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.14542">their new paper</a>, published in the <em>European of Journal of Neuroscience</em>, the team investigated whether there is evidence for this bias in the literature. The researchers looked at 1,008 articles published in three major neuroimaging journals across the course of 2017, noting whether each study reported participants’ handedness — and if so, how many adextral participants were included.</p>
<p>The team found that a little over half of the studies reported participants’ handedness. But of the almost 32,000 people in those studies, only 3.2% were adextral — considerably lower than the rate of 10-13% in the general population. Overall, fewer than one in five of the studies that reported handedness included any adextrals at all, suggesting that most were actively excluding these people.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, studies looking at clinical populations and children were more likely to include adextral participants than those on non-clinical and adult populations. The authors suggest that this may be because it is harder to recruit from these populations, so researchers are more willing to include non-right-handed people.</p>
<p>The findings are not necessarily that surprising, though it is interesting to see the hard data to back up what many neuropsychologists may have already expected. But the key question is — does it matter that adextrals are underrepresented?</p>
<p>The authors make a convincing case that it does. Handedness is just another kind of individual difference, the researchers write, much like memory capacity or socioeconomic status. Both of those factors can also influence how language is represented in the brain, but are not normally used as a basis for excluding people from research. And we can only fully understand whether there are any differences in the brains of right- and left-handed people if both groups are actually included in research. “Handedness should be treated with the same measured scientific curiosity that is now afforded to individual differences such as language proficiency, working memory capacity [and] SES,” write the researchers. Instead of excluding adextrals, they add, statistical methods can be used to control for any potential effects of handedness.</p>
<p>And if that’s not enough, the logic for excluding adextrals even from language studies is flawed, say Bailey and colleagues. Although 30% of adextrals don’t show the normal left hemisphere language lateralisation, the same is true for about 4% of right-handed people. And because adextrals already represent a much smaller proportion of the population, including them will have little impact on how many participants have this “atypical lateralisation”.</p>
<p>The researchers say they hope their work will encourage others to take a hard look at whether they really need to be excluding adextrals from their studies. “Such a change in attitudes will surely benefit both our understanding of how handedness relates to brain function, organization and structure and, more broadly, our understanding of the brain at the whole-population level,” they write.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Throughout our lives, we set ourselves goals — to pass an exam, run a marathon, lose 10 kilograms of excess weight or gain a promotion. Given the importance of such goals to our physical and psychological wellbeing, it’s not surprising that there’s has been a wealth of research into how best to set, work towards, and achieve them.</p>
<p>But let’s say you succeed — what then? Psychologists have paid less attention to people’s behaviour <em>after</em> they’ve achieved their goals. And although it’s generally good for us to continue to study, exercise, eat healthily, work hard, and so on, this doesn’t always transpire. For example, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21538">one follow-up</a> of contestants who’d won the weight-loss TV show <em>The Biggest Loser</em> found that six years on, most weighed even more than they had at the start of the show.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-34220-001">recent study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em> offers a solution. People are more likely to maintain good behaviours, the researchers find, if instead of thinking about achieving a goal as “arriving at a destination,” they view it as “completing a journey.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37644"></span></p>
<p>We rely heavily on metaphor when considering abstract concepts and aspects of our lives. So Szu-Chi Huang and Jennifer Aaker at the Stanford Graduate School of Business reasoned that thinking about a goal as the completion of a journey might prompt people to reflect on how they had been at the start, and all the ups and downs along the way. This might make them feel that they had changed to be the kind of person who engages in these specific behaviours, and make them more likely to maintain them.</p>
<p>In a series of six studies involving more than 1,600 people, this is exactly what the pair found. They first looked at two groups comprising more than 400 American students and university staff who had recently achieved <span>either</span><span> </span><span>an academic or a fitness goal. Participants were asked to think about how their experience of attaining the goal was like “completing a journey” or “reaching a destination,” or were just told to think about achieving the goal without a metaphor attached. Those who viewed the goal as the completion of a journey not only expressed stronger intentions to continue the goal-related behaviours, but actually did so (the fitness journey group were more likely to sign up for an ongoing fitness programme, for example).</span></p>
<p>In subsequent research, the team further characterised this effect. In one study, 265 dieters set themselves daily calorie intake goals and tracked their consumption over seven days. After the end of the diet programme, those who thought about their achievement as the completion of a journey were again more likely to indicate that they would continue their dieting behaviour. And importantly, this group also had greater feelings of personal growth, suggesting this could be the underlying mechanism for the effect.</p>
<p>Another study, which involved a 14-day walking programme with a goal of achieving 100,000 steps, revealed that the journey metaphor encouraged beneficial behaviour after participants had attained their goal, but not when they were getting close to achieving it. When a goal is in sight, but not yet achieved, “focusing on the destination aspects of this path could be more motivating, likely because it accentuated the end goal that one still needed to achieve,” the pair notes.</p>
<p>And the phenomenon was not just restricted to American participants. In a final study, the researchers followed 106 executives who were finishing a business education programme in Ghana. In what they were told was an exit interview, the participants were encouraged to describe their attainment of their qualification using a journey or a destination metaphor. Six months on, members of the journey group were more likely to be using practices they had learned on the course.</p>
<p>It’s true that getting people to think about their journey to achieving a goal might not always work, or may even backfire — if the journey has been very hard or unpleasant, for example. However, the researchers add, “it is our hope that this research serves as the beginning of a journey of diverse research programs that utilize a variety of metaphors to enhance goal pursuers’ chances of maintaining their success.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Blog-Header-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><strong>Guest Authors: Dylan Roskams-Edris (Open Science Consultant and Invited Scholar with the Center for Genomics and Policy,), JB Poline (Associate Professor, Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University), and Nikola Stikov (Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal).</strong></p>
<p><strong>First off, what is Plan S and why does it matter?</strong></p>
<p>In September 2018 <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">a group of European funding agencies, along with some private funders</a>, assessed how scientific information is disseminated – namely that university researchers receive public funding, perform experiments, collect data, write articles about the results, review each other’s articles, and then the publicly funded institutions they work for foot the ever increasing bill to buy access to all this work – and decided enough was enough; publicly funded science should be publicly accessible.</p>
<p>They formed<em> cOAlition S</em> and announced <em>Plan S</em> which, boiled down, says that after 2020 any work funded in whole or in part by the members of the coalition must be published in journals that allow immediate, free, and public access to articles. They also published a set of guidelines and best practices that journals publishing funded research must follow. Those interested in the details of Plan S are encouraged to read about them <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Only 5 months after Plan S was revealed, the University of California system – one of the largest and most well-respected public academic systems in the world – <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">announced that they were ending their relationship with the publisher Elsevier</a>. The split was due primarily to Elsevier’s refusal to make all UC published research open access on the UC’s terms.</p>
<p>These efforts are a great start.</p>
<p>For those actively working to open global research efforts, however, efforts like Plan S are only the beginning. The push for open science is much larger than making scholarly articles open access. Open science demands that the data, software, materials, and know-how that enables science are also shared – or better yet, openly published.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing, Publishing, and Open Access Articles</strong></p>
<p>It is worth pausing here for a brief aside about the distinction between open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open access publishing of articles. All of these are important but for open science to be successful the distinction between them has to be clear.</p>
<p>Open sharing consists of making research resources available in a way they can be freely accessed and used. Sharing datasets in a repository or data sharing platform like <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/organization">Dryad</a>, or code used for data analysis and visualization via a service like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, are good examples. Sharing in this way rapidly disseminates resources and makes them available for use and adaptation by others as quickly as possible. Open publishing of research resources, however, involves the filtration of these resources through other researchers. These peer researchers make sure that the shared resource – whether it is data, code, single figures, or any of the plethora of resources developed throughout the scientific process – is in a form that is standard and easily usable by others, as well as presenting those resources in a curated form on a website or repository. Open access publishing of articles is the primary target of efforts like Plan S and relates to publishing scholarly articles in such a way that they are freely accessible and usable.</p>
<p><a href="http://conp.ca/">The Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a> (CONP), along with myriad other organizations, are developing the resources needed to enable open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open publishing of articles. By doing so the CONP is helping open science and reduce the current inequalities in access to all of the tools and research outputs science needs to thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Publications</strong></p>
<p>Assessing the situation here in Canada, the current <a href="http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html?OpenDocument">open access policies of Canada’s primary trio of scientific funding agencies</a> take a weaker stance than Plan S and, as we’ve already argued, efforts like Plan S are only a start. Even if Canada were to suddenly marshal its forces of scientific-policy and follow the lead of cOAlition S we would still be well behind where open science should be. Scholarly papers are just the tip of the iceberg of scientific discovery. Any given publication is the result of months of work involving data collection, coming up with hypotheses, planning experiments, carefully recording progress in notebooks, developing software, analyzing results, writing drafts, and working with editors. The iceberg metaphor is a good one; the publication, like the burg’s tip, is what is seen, but floats atop a much larger body of work that supports it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8719" height="447" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png" width="482" /></a></p>
<p>Open science in its full and rich instantiation is about sharing and publishing all as many scientific resources as possible to enable collaboration throughout the research process. It grows from the simple idea that working together is more effective than working in silos; that many hands make light work and many eyes spot more errors. In order to work together scientists need to be able to freely discover each other’s work and use each other’s resources, not just have access to the polished end result. Doing so will improve replication, catch errors in methodology early on, and prevent redundancy, all while reducing unnecessary barriers to discovery and outlays from the public coffers.</p>
<p>The internet and modern computing technology make this dissemination possible. What we need now is for funders, institutions, and scientists themselves to commit to encouraging and enabling the sharing their data, code, notebooks, experimental protocols, draft manuscripts, and all the other pivotal elements of discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Building on Plan S</strong></p>
<p>Plan S does mention the sharing of scientific data. On their <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">Principles and Implementation</a> page they encourage the sharing of research resources underlying publications in repositories that make the resource “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”, as well as highlighting resource sharing as a key topic of negotiations between journals, funders, and institutions. Doing so, however, requires repositories where data and code that can be stored, data sharing platforms where that data can easily linked to publications, as well as organized curation efforts to make sure the linked research resources are usable by others.</p>
<p>The CONP is building exactly these resources for the neuroscience community. It is collaboratively developing the user portal, online publishing, informational resources, and governance and policy mechanisms that will enable neuroscientists to disseminate each component of their work as openly as possible, and to keep them open. The CONP scientists and stakeholders believe that these resources will catalyze collaboration and accelerate neuroscientific discovery.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Needed Now to Go Further</strong></p>
<p>But more is needed.</p>
<p>Opening science requires the collective effort of funders, data sharing platforms, academic institutions, and individual scientists. Science doesn’t have to be opened all at once, but steps down the open road must be taken, and must be taken now. The CONP will provide tools and guidance, but scientific culture shift requires a concerted community effort.</p>
<p>Some first steps needed to enable the open publishing of all research resources include: (1) forging agreements and partnerships between journals and open science platforms to make it easy for scientists to share their data, publish it in a curated form, and link it to publications, (2) promotion and tenure policies at academic institutions that value the sharing and publishing of data <em>on par</em> with producing articles, (3) funding agencies that require (and enforce) sharing and publishing data, code, and materials associated with publications as a condition of receiving a grant, and (4) a commitment from scientists themselves to change the culture of science towards openly sharing and publishing as many of their resources as they can.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/tick-2371782_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of specific ticks and has a variety of clinical presentations, most notably a bull’s eye rash (erythema migrans) and an associated flu-like illness. Its distribution through Europe is heterogenous with a large variation in incidence between countries and within them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the United Kingdom, information relating to infected patients’ characteristics, where they live and how they are managed within the National Health Service (NHS), is poorly understood. Currently most information is derived from Public Health England’s and Health Protection Scotland’s laboratory surveillance schemes. We are very fortunate that in England and Wales, data from all NHS hospitals are readily available, which enables the analysis of a variety of different medical conditions at a national level.</p>
<p>Through the analysis of these data we were able to describe which Lyme disease patients access hospitals for management and treatment, and for the first time, start to describe how patients enter and progress through NHS care.</p>
<p>Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals. Numbers of cases that require hospital admission are still relatively low compared to national surveillance figures. Most Lyme disease cases are confirmed and treated with antibiotics by a GP without the need for laboratory diagnosis or referral to a hospital. UK national surveillance figures are based solely on laboratory-confirmed cases. These figures will include a mixture of cases from primary care and hospitals. Therefore, current surveillance figures will always have a higher incidence than hospital cases alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cases that require hospital admission likely represent more clinically complex cases. They are also substantially lower than similar hospital figures reported in continental Europe. We found that cases peaked each year in August; this is consistent with people being active outdoors whilst ticks are questing for a blood meal.</p>
<p>Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white. The ages most affected were young children (6-10 years old) and adults approaching retirement age (61-65 years old).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11191" style="width: 343px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11191" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-3-300x243.png" width="333" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3 – Population demographics of Lyme disease patients within hospital administrative records in England and Wales (1998-2015)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Almost all parts of England and Wales reported Lyme disease cases attending hospitals with clear hotspots of disease in central southern England. This highlights that while Lyme disease poses a risk across both countries, for most people this risk is likely to be very low as the majority of cases were found in these hotspots. Unsurprisingly, more cases were found in rural rather than urban locations. These data are based on where a patient lives rather than where they were bitten and so provides a more accurate estimate of where clinical burden will be placed on NHS hospitals.</p>
<p>This study is one of only a handful that describe the sociodemographics of the population affected by Lyme disease. We found a trend that increasing numbers of new patients were found in parts of the countries that are considered to have low levels of economic deprivation. The data collected gives no indication why this is the case and it is likely to be due to multiple factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable parts of the population which would aid in future tick bite prevention and Lyme disease awareness campaigns.</p>
<p>The most novel part of the research describes how patients with Lyme disease are managed within hospitals and the NHS. The majority of patients were only admitted once and stayed  4.47 days, on average. 35.5% of all patients were admitted as a day case. The variety in admission length and departments treating the patient could represent either diversity and complexity of Lyme disease symptoms or differing management strategies within hospitals. This needs to be explored as it appears that the management of Lyme disease patients in hospitals is discordant.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11193" style="width: 378px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11193" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-4-300x279.png" width="368" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 4 – The average incidence rate of Lyme disease in English and Welsh local authorities (n=348), (1998-2015)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>More than thirty percent of patients with Lyme disease enter hospital through the accident and emergency department. It is unlikely that all of these patients have acute symptoms. Why are patients accessing care through this route? It could be due to a lack of knowledge or the inability to get an appointment with a primary care clinician. This requires further exploration.</p>
<p>This study, like previous ones based on administrative data, may be limited by some patients not being coded correctly as having Lyme disease in hospital records. It would be difficult to truly validate the cases we identified without reading each patients written hospital notes, this would be ethically challenging. Despite these limitations, the strong trends described in this paper may indicate that these are small.</p>
<p>Linking this data to both primary care and laboratory data would facilitate a better account of the Lyme disease patient care pathway. Adding to our understanding of these factors could lead to better patient care, education and resource allocation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales</p></blockquote>
<p>This research has highlighted that Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales. However, Lyme disease presentation in hospital is an uncommon event except in southern-central England. Patient care within the NHS is not streamlined and may reflect variation in patient management or the range of Lyme disease symptoms. This work can provide a reference point to future Lyme disease research in the United Kingdom and any Lyme disease hospital-based research internationally.</p>
<p>Being aware of the signs &amp; symptoms of Lyme Disease is important so that you can receive early diagnosis and treatment from your family doctor. Symptoms typically develop up to 3 weeks after being bitten by a tick and include a spreading circular red rash or flu-like symptoms. When you visit your GP or call NHS 111, remember to tell them where you have been and if you remember being bitten.

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>At 8:07am on a Saturday morning in early 2018, phones throughout Hawaii buzzed with a distressing message. “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter,” it read. “This is not a drill.” Similar warnings interrupted television and radio transmissions. And until a follow-up message 38 minutes later clarified that it had been a false alarm, many residents were left expecting the worst<span>.</span></p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343186">according to a new study</a> published in <em>American Psychologist</em>, the toll on Hawaii residents lasted much longer than those terrifying minutes. Researchers analysing the kinds of words tweeted before and after the false alarm have found that anxiety seemed to be heightened for days — particularly among those who appeared the least anxious to begin with.</p>
<p><span id="more-37638"></span></p>
<p>Previous experimental work has suggested that the anxiety provoked by an imminent, unavoidable threat like an electric shock increases as the expected event draws closer — and continues to persist even after it is revealed to have been a false alarm.</p>
<p>But these findings have been restricted to artificial scenarios in the lab, note Nickolas Jones and Roxane Cohen Silver in the new paper. So the pair turned to the Hawaii missile alert to see whether similar patterns of anxiety occur after a real-world false alarm.</p>
<p>The researchers examined the tweets of <span>almost 15,000 Twitter users, all of whom were following Hawaiian organisations,</span><span> in the 6 weeks before and 3 weeks after the alert. To get a measure of anxiety, they calculated the proportion of tweets that contained anxiety words (like “afraid” or “worried”) listed in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count programme, a tool often used by psychologists to analyse the content of texts.</span></p>
<p>The pair found that the overall daily proportion of tweets containing anxiety words remained relatively stable in the weeks leading up to the false alarm, hovering around 3%. Unsurprisingly, that number leapt up on the day of the alert, to about 8%. A detailed look at tweets across the course of the day revealed that the number of anxiety-related tweets began to rise immediately after the alert was sent out — and continued to increase until the all clear was given 38 minutes later, consistent with work suggesting anxiety builds as a threat gets closer.</p>
<p>After the all clear, the proportion of tweets expressing anxiety gradually decreased — but, overall, it took 2 days to drop back down to a stable level. However, this pattern also depended on the tweeters’ baseline anxiety. A “low anxiety” group, whose tweets in the weeks before the alert had contained no anxiety words, took a whole 41 hours to level out after the false alarm; even then, they continued to use more anxiety words than before. In contrast, a “medium anxiety” group, whose baseline tweeting did contain some expressions of anxiety, took just 23 hours to stabilise. Although counterintuitive, this result is in-line with findings that moderate levels of past adverse experiences <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/22/for-some-experiencing-trauma-may-act-as-a-form-of-cognitive-training-that-increases-their-mental-control/">may boost resilience</a>.</p>
<p>Finally — and unexpectedly — a small “high anxiety” group actually made <em>fewer</em> tweets containing anxiety words after the alert. The authors suggest this could reflect a change of perspective brought on by the threat of death and destruction.  “Users in the high prealert anxiety group may have recognized how much worse things could have been had the missile threat been real,” they write.</p>
<p>Of course, the extent to which the content of tweets is a valid measure in psychological research <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">is a matter of some debate</a>. Twitter users are not representative of the population more broadly, for instance, a limitation the authors acknowledge. Some recent research has also suggested that a person’s use of emotion-related words <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/29/people-who-use-more-happy-words-are-not-necessarily-happier-an-awkward-finding-for-language-based-emotion-research/">isn’t necessarily a good indication of their actual subjective feelings</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results provide some of the first real-world evidence that — for most people — anxiety is heightened for some time after a false alarm. “Our results reveal how potently frightening a crisis period can be and highlight how intense experiences like this may have lasting effects,” the authors write, stressing the need for agencies to increase outreach and ensure residents receive fast, accurate information when false alarms occur.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>“Microdosing” psychedelic drugs involves regularly taking amounts so tiny that they don’t impair a person’s normal functioning, but — it’s claimed — subtly enhance wellbeing, concentration and creativity. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/17/rare-systematic-study-of-the-effects-of-microdosing-psychedlics-finds-benefits-but-not-of-the-kind-that-users-most-expect/">In May, for example, the Digest reported on a study</a> that found hints of reduced stress and increased emotional intensity among people who microdosed LSD and psilocybin, from ‘magic’ mushrooms.</p>
<p>However, we also stressed that there has been little research into the technique — and now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881119857204">review of the field</a> published in the <em>Journal of </em><em>Psychopharmacology</em> concludes that while the popularity of microdosing has exploded over the past eight years, knowledge about what it actually does remains patchy and anecdotal. In fact, there are still far more questions about the technique than answers, write Kim Kuypers at Maastricht University, and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-37630"></span></p>
<p>In their paper, the team lays out what has been established so far — and also the key unknowns. First: what is a microdose, anyway? When it comes to LSD or the active ingredients from magic mushrooms, there is no agreed scientific consensus, though a microdose is often defined as approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose. However, since there’s significant variability in the level of psilocybin in a magic mushroom, microdosing by weight of dried mushroom could lead to a huge variation in actual doses taken each time.</p>
<p>Most studies to date have also generally lumped together people who self-identify as microdosers into a single group. But there’s a lot of variation in how microdosers schedule their consumption. In a 2011 book that had a huge influence on the take-up of the technique, James Fadiman suggested two consecutive days of dosing followed by two non-dosing days. However, some people take small doses every weekday, and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/22/7/426/5509881">one recent survey of microdosers</a> found that half had come up with their own schedule.</p>
<p>Variations in the actual doses that are consumed, and how often they are taken, make it hard to draw conclusions from studies that explore effects reported by microdosers, the team note. Improvements in energy, mood, cognition, concentration, stress management, creativity, spiritual awareness and productivity have all been frequently reported in surveys of microdosers. However, “all of these reports are confounded by the lack of certainty relating to the actual dose used, or indeed the provenance of the active ingredient, and the absence of placebo conditions,” Kuypers and her colleagues write. (The study published in May that found impacts on stress and emotional intensity suffered from all these drawbacks.) Anecdotal reports may not play out in controlled trials: for example, the team notes that to date, no placebo-controlled study has found statistically significant effects of microdosing on creativity.</p>
<p>Finally, though single active doses of drugs like psilocybin are considered to be relatively safe, it’s still unclear whether repeated small doses carry additional risks. For instance, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) binds to a serotonin receptor that plays a role in heart function, and some drugs that act on this receptor, including the diet medication Phen/Fen, were pulled from the market after heart complications and fatalities. Future work should test whether multiple microdoses of psilocin have negative effects on the heart, the authors write.</p>
<p>Essential safety-testing aside, much more gold-standard, placebo-controlled research into the effects of microdosing is required, the team argues, as well as a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind any effects. For now, Kuypers says, “there is a lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective”.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_162-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Netflix recently edited the controversial suicide scene from its widely popular <a href="http://netflix.com/13reasonswhy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>13 Reasons Why</em></a><em> </em>series, entirely deleting the protagonist Hannah’s graphic death. The scene in question has been the center of ongoing debate since its release.</p>
<blockquote><p>A high-profile suicide (even a fictional one) can actually lead to an observed increase in suicidal behavior in others.</p></blockquote>
<p>For many mental health advocates, this decision will be a welcome move for one very important reason – <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1943-278X.1989.tb00363.x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suicide can be contagious</a>. What this means is that a high-profile suicide (even a fictional one) can actually lead to an observed increase in suicidal behavior in others.</p>
<p>Research shows that the media can play a formative role in influencing suicide contagion where sensational and glorified coverage can contribute to an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5841" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased</a> prevalence of suicide among vulnerable individuals. Impressionable youth can be <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764202250670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially vulnerable</a> to contagion via sensational portrayals of suicide. In fact, recent studies have shown negative suicide outcomes associated with the release of <em>13 Reasons Why</em>, from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856719302886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suicide spikes in youth</a>, to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820689/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rise in internet searches about suicide and self-harm</a>.</p>
<p>Having observed the ensuing debate surrounding <em>13 Reasons Why</em>, we decided to examine how the series was reported across assorted Canadian newspapers. This analysis was important, as sensational and glorified coverage is shown to contribute to the increased prevalence of suicide contagion. Conversely, responsible coverage can also act to raise awareness and reduce associated negative effects.</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, we found that the newspapers had a high-level of adherence to key guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>To do so, we gathered articles from best-selling newspapers following the launch of the series. We then assessed whether these articles adhered to suicide reporting guidelines, and looked at the major topics and issues discussed within them. Overall, we found that the articles manifested a high-level of adherence to key guidelines. For example, almost 90% of articles did not go into detail about the method of Hannah’s suicide, a practice shown to be helpful in preventing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.170698" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contagion</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, journalists tended to refrain from using archaic and inappropriate language. For example, only 15% used the word “commit” – a discouraged term that implies suicide is a crime. Additionally, we found almost half of the articles actively discussed wider social issues associated with suicide and/or included quotes from mental health professionals. Articles such as these provided valuable context, leading to more considerate and responsible coverage of an inherently sensitive topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Only 1 in 4 articles included helpful information for readers who may be in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>That being said, there was some room for improvement. Only 1 in 4 articles included helpful information for readers who may be in distress, such as a suicide hotline number. This has previously been identified as an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20807970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">important component of suicide reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this research showed the media applied a much-needed critical lens when discussing the series and its implications for youth suicide, involving praise and criticism in equal measure. Common criticisms included the gratuitously explicit suicide scene in the final episode, and its potentially harmful impact on already vulnerable viewers. Common praises included its ability to promote dialogue and awareness about youth issues such as bullying, sexual assault, substance use, and mental health.</p>
<blockquote><p>No public health issue has been solved by silence.</p></blockquote>
<p>The mere fact that this debate has persisted since the release of the series is inherently positive. Society should not shy away from discussing suicide. Silence can perpetuate stigma and reduce rates of help-seeking behavior among vulnerable individuals. No public health issue has been solved by silence.</p>
<p><em>13 Reasons Why</em> kick-started conversations about mental health and youth suicide previously not discussed. For this, we should be grateful. However, the suicide scene was contrary to all guidelines about suicide portrayal with its gratuitously explicit depiction of the protagonist’s suicide. Thus, we should also be grateful for its deletion.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the Canadian news media acted in a socially responsible manner; using the series as a point of considered discussion about youth suicide, and closely following common guidelines on suicide reporting.</p>
<p>This is good news. And so is the decision to delete the scene of Hannah’s suicide.</p>
<p>To Netflix we say, thank you.</p>

That much is routine.

The question seems simple enough. “A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia definition of hallucination">hallucination</a> is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space.” When we think of visual hallucinations, we often think of trippy colorful images induced by psychedelic drugs (<a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/hallucinogens" target="_blank">hallucinogens</a>). <br /><br />Are <b>dreams</b> hallucinations? How about visual <b>imagery</b>? Optical <b>illusions</b> of motion from viewing a non-moving pattern? No, no, and no (according to this narrow definition). Hallucinations are subjective and inaccessible to others, much as my recent posts discussed the <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank" title="Aphantasia">presence or absence of visual imagery</a> in individual humans. However, people can tell us what they're seeing (unlike animals).<br /><br />Visual hallucinations can occur in <a href="http://medicinainterna.net.pe/sites/default/files/Desordenes%20psicoticos.pdf" target="_blank">psychotic disorders</a> such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, although auditory hallucinations are more common in those conditions. Visual hallucinations are more often associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Among patients with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2009.62" target="_blank">Parkinson's Disease</a>, 33% to 75% experience visual hallucinations, usually related to dopaminergic or anticholinergic drug therapy.<br /><br />In contrast, hallucinations in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12264-019-00341-4" target="_blank">dementia with Lewy Bodies</a> (DLB) are diagnostic of the disease, and not related to pharmacological treatment. “Recurrent complex visual hallucinations ... are typically well-formed,  often  consisting of figures, such as people or animals.” The cause may be related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body" target="_blank" title="Lewy bodies are abnormal aggregates of protein that develop inside neurons">pathology</a> in subcortical visual structures such  as the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, rather than the visual cortex itself. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418308984" target="_blank">more specific hypothesis</a> is that loss of α7 nicotinic receptors in the <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(14)00815-0" target="_blank" title="may have a complex relationship with arousal and cognitive function">thalamic reticular nucleus</a> could lead to hallucinations in DLB.<br /><br /><br /><b>Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS)</b><br /><br />Visual hallucinations are also caused by certain types of visual impairment, e.g. age-related <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts" target="_blank">macular degeneration</a>,  which leads to the loss of central vision. Damage to the macular portion of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10885/" target="_blank">retina</a> can <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts" target="_blank">cause people to “see”</a> simple patterns of colors or shapes that aren't there, or even images of people, animals, flowers, planets, and scary figures. Individuals with CBS know that the hallucinations aren't real, but they're distressing nonetheless. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1PbbZc2N2c/XVBit7IsrzI/AAAAAAAAM6U/EFWKGqfbX2YguhdMctpuEdqrQp3RMF3EACLcBGAs/s1600/Charles%2BBonnet%2Bhallucination.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="405" data-original-width="720" height="225" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1PbbZc2N2c/XVBit7IsrzI/AAAAAAAAM6U/EFWKGqfbX2YguhdMctpuEdqrQp3RMF3EACLcBGAs/s400/Charles%2BBonnet%2Bhallucination.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: right;"><b><span>image from the <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/visual-hallucinations" target="_blank">Macular Society</a></span><span style="color: purple;"><sup> 1</sup></span></b></div><br /><br />“Why are you discussing DLB and CBS here,” you might ask, “because these conditions don't involve abnormal stimulation of the visual cortex.” I brought them up because visual  hallucinations in humans can occur for any number of reasons, not just from manipulation of highly specific cell types in primary visual cortex (which only occurs in optogenetic experiments with animals).<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">hey look there's a new opto thing must be Thursday</div>— Mark Baxter 🐵🏳️‍🌈 (@markgbaxter) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgbaxter/status/1151972066536693764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2019</a></blockquote><br /><br /><b>Electrical Stimulation Studies in Humans</b><br /><br />A typical starting point here would be Wilder Penfield and the history of surgical epileptology, but I'll skip ahead to the modern day.

Then the investigators stimulated these two focal points while the patient viewed faces, objects, and photos of famous faces and places. Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) of the FFA produced visual distortions while the patient viewed real faces.

And one day (hypothetically speaking), I'd like to present more than direct quotes and my cartoonish version of the optogenetic ensemble and behavioral training methods. But today isn't that day.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Using ChRmine [<i>a fancy new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin" target="_blank">opsin</a></i>] together with custom holographic devices to create arbitrarily specified light  patterns [<i>horizontally or vertically drifting gratings</i>], we were able to measure naturally occurring large-scale 3D  ensemble activity patterns during visual experience and then replay  these natural patterns at the level of many individually specified  cells. We found that driving specific ensembles of cells on the basis of  natural stimulus-selectivity resulted in recruitment of a broad network  with dynamical patterns corresponding to those elicited by real visual  stimuli and also gave rise to the correctly selective behaviors even in  the absence of visual input.</blockquote><br />Briefly, the investigators captured patterns of activity in <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/know-your-brain-primary-visual-cortex" target="_blank" title="primary visual cortex">V1</a> layer 2/3 neurons and layer 5 neurons that responded to horizontal or vertical gratings, and then played back the same patterns to those neurons in the absence of a visual stimulus. There goes the coarseness of EBS-induced phosphenes in humans... But obviously, the one great advantage of human studies is that your subjects can tell you what they see. Nonetheless, everyone wants to say that laser-activated nerve cells cause the mice to hallucinate vertical bars.<br /><br />What really happened is that mice were trained to discriminate between horizontal and vertical gratings. The task required them to respond to the vertical, but not the horizontal. After training, visual stimulation with gratings was compared to optogenetic stimulation of classifier-identified neural ensembles in the absence of gratings. How well did the mice perform with optogenetic-only stimulation?<br /><br /><span><b>Modified from Fig. 5 (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw5202" target="_blank">Marshel et al., 2019)</a>.</b> <b>(A)</b> Discrimination performance during visual-only stimulation (<b>black</b>) and tuned-ensemble stimulation (<b><span style="color: red;">red</span></b>) over several weeks. <b>(B)</b> Discrimination performance for tuned-ensemble stimulation versus visual trials (P &gt; 0.1 paired t test, two-tailed, n = 112 sessions across five mice). </span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFvgB_NLTKY/XVDGpKr4yeI/AAAAAAAAM7o/-W5tTKYgaNosKNse6Iw0Q_AtofhnFAscwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2B5A%2526B%2Blarge.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="270" data-original-width="825" height="130" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFvgB_NLTKY/XVDGpKr4yeI/AAAAAAAAM7o/-W5tTKYgaNosKNse6Iw0Q_AtofhnFAscwCLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2B5A%2526B%2Blarge.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Eventually the mice did just about as well on the discrimination task with optogenetic stimulation of the horizontally or vertically-tuned neurons, compared to when the horizontal or vertical stimuli were actually presented. Were these mice “hallucinating” vertical gratings?  Or did they merely learn to respond when a specific neural ensemble was activated? Isn't this somewhat like neurofeedback? During training, the mice were rewarded or punished based on their correct or incorrect response to the “vertical” ensemble stimulation. They can't tell us what, if anything, they saw under those conditions.<br /><br />And the authors themselves noted the following limitation, that “mice initially required some training involving paired  optogenetic and visual stimuli before optogenetic activation alone  sufficed to drive behavioral discrimination.” <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw5202">Marshel et al.</a> correctly invoked the “it takes a village” explanation that many other cortical and subcortical regions are required to generate a full natural visual percept. <br /><br />My frustration with the press coverage stems from inaccurate language and overblown interpretations.<b><span style="color: purple;"><sup>3</sup></span></b>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[So what else is new?]</span></span>  From the <i>New York Times</i>:<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/mice-brain-hallucinations.html" target="_blank">Why Are These Mice Hallucinating?

In large part, I think, because although OA began as a bottom-up revolution it was never widely embraced by researchers. However, OA advocates managed to persuade governments, funders and institutions that their colleagues should be compelled to embrace open access. This has seen a series of ever more stringent OA mandates being imposed on researchers, increasing the bureaucratic burden on them (amongst other things). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Monographs are a particularly contested area because of their length, their narrative form, and the licensing issues that this raises. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It has not helped that OA advocates promised open access would reduce the costs of scholarly communication. In reality, costs have risen. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This last point is particularly troublesome in the UK context as OA policies have been introduced without providing the necessary funding to support them. As a result, researchers can discover that they have been mandated to make their work open access but cannot afford to pay the article-processing charge (</span><a href="https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc"><span>APC</span></a><span>) needed if they want to satisfy the government’s </span><a href="http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/"><span>preference for gold OA</span></a><span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This has been a challenge even for researchers at wealthy and prestigious institutions. Last year, for instance, Oxford University library had to </span><a href="http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/2018/01/10/oxfords-rcuk-open-access-block-grant-update-no-funds-remaining/"><span>inform faculty</span></a><span> that its OA fund had been exhausted and so they should delay submitting to journals until it had been replenished.<span>  </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>At the same time, the bureaucracy surrounding OA compliance has become so complex that universities have had to recruit legions of support staff to interpret and manage the escalating number of policies (some of which have proved contradictory). Indeed, such is the complexity now that even specialist support staff can struggle to decode the rules.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In short, the UK OA policy environment is far too complex, and it is seriously underfunded. For researchers, this is frustrating and depressing.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>No one knows this better than </span><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/edith-hall"><span>Edith Hall</span></a><span>, a professor of Classics at King’s College London. (Full disclosure: Edith and I are co-parents). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Free for all</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Given the topic of her new book – co-authored with colleague </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-stead-75059045/?originalSubdomain=uk"><span>Henry Stead</span></a><span> – Hall felt it really important that it be freely available for anyone to read. The book’s theme is the historic exclusion of the poor from education in the Greek and Roman Classics. To not make her work open access, Hall felt, would be an act of hypocrisy.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Moreover, since the organisation that funded the research in the book – The Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (</span><a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/"><span>AHRC</span></a><span>) – has had an </span><a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/about/policies/openaccess/"><span>open access policy in place since 2005</span></a><span>it seemed the correct thing to do.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>AHRC was until recently one of the funding bodies of the umbrella organisation Research Councils UK (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Councils_UK"><span>RCUK</span></a><span>), which itself has had an open access policy in place </span><a href="http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/"><span>since 2012</span></a><span>. RCUK’s role has now moved to UK Research and Innovation (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Research_and_Innovation"><span>UKRI</span></a><span>), which has inherited both the RCUK policy and the </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/01/hefce-open-access-ref-gamechanger/"><span>2014 OA policy</span></a><span> of the Higher Education Council for England (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England"><span>HEFCE</span></a><span>). HEFCE manages the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework"><span>Research Excellence Framework</span></a><span>and the future funding of Hall’s department depends on her and her colleagues submitting their work for REF assessment.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In other words, Hall’s work is subject to several different OA policies, all of which were introduced with the aim of making publicly funded research open access. <span> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>True, only research papers have to be made open access on a mandatory basis today, but all the UK policies recommend and actively encourage researchers to make their monographs open access as well. As the Guidance on Submissions for REF 2021 </span><a href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1092/ref-2019_01-guidance-on-submissions.pdf"><span>puts it</span></a><span>, “The funding bodies [also] encourage institutions to take a proportionate view of the costs and benefits of making other types of outputs (including monographs) available as open access.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Complexity aside, the problem these policies face is that they were introduced on the assumption that open access would be less costly than traditional methods, or at least cost neutral. As noted, this has not proved the case. In fact, it was only after it had introduced its OA policy that RCUK realised it had imposed a significant new cost burden on UK universities. In 2013, therefore, it had to provide </span><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/11/01/uk-government-stands-up-for-open-access-with-a-10-million-funding-boost/"><span>additional funding</span></a><span> to research-intensive universities like King’s in order for them to comply, in the form of </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/funding/information-for-award-holders/open-access/open-access-policy/open-access-block-grants/"><span>annual block grants</span></a><span> to pay for APCs. At the time, it was assumed that this would only need to be a temporary measure, but the money has had to be paid ever since. (King’s 2019/2020 block grant is </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/research/2019-2020-block-grant-awards-pdf/"><span>£686,560</span></a><span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Keen to make her work open access, conscious that OA is now a UK priority, and aware that funding is available to help pay for open access, Hall contacted </span><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/index"><span>Research Support</span></a><span> at King’s (which manages the RCUK block grant) to ask if they could contribute to the Book Processing Charge (</span><a href="https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc"><span>BPC</span></a><span>) she would need to pay to make her book OA. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To her joy, Research Support replied that they would be happy to fund the full cost of making the book OA (£10,000). Explaining why they were providing the money, Research Support cited the </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/documents/rcukopenaccesspolicy-pdf/"><span>RCUK Policy on Open Access</span></a><span>. Although RCUK’s open access policy does not require mandatory OA for monographs or books, they said, it does encourage “authors of such material to consider making them Open Access where possible.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In addition, they said, the RCUK policy states that research organisations “may use the block grant in the manner they consider will best deliver the RCUK Policy on Open Access, as long as the primary purpose to support the payment of APCs is fulfilled.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Confident that the funding was now in place to make their book OA, Hall and Stead signed an open access agreement with Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis (RTF) and began writing up their research. When the book</span><span>’</span><span>s text was finally accepted by RFT Hall emailed Research Support to ask where the publisher should send its invoice.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Research Support replied, however, that as too many calls are now being made on the block grant, they could no longer honour their commitment to pay. When Hall questioned this change of heart, she was informed that – contrary to what Research Support had told her at the time she applied for the subvention – it was not actually permitted to use money from RCUK block grants to pay BPCs. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Alarmed that if it did not go into production immediately their book would not be published in time to be eligible for the all-important 2021 REF, Hall and Stead concluded they had no choice but to ask RTF to rewrite the contract along traditional lines and accept that their book would not be open access after all. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Wider significance?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Hall’s experience has been demoralising and frustrating. But does it have any wider significance? I think so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Let’s recall that when the open access movement was founded – at the meeting of the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative (</span><a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read"><span>BOAI</span></a><span>) – the resulting declaration stated (inter alia) that:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>“Removing access barriers to [the scholarly] literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This democratic, upbeat vision is a far cry from the expensive, oppressive and bureaucratic environment that surrounds open access in the UK today. And one can reasonably assume that many other UK researchers have been experiencing similar frustrations to Hall. This can only alienate them from the practice and principles of open access, and so delay the transformation to OA the UK government wants to see. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>There is, however, a larger and more pressing question we have to ask: Is the open access strategy currently being pursued in the UK affordable, particularly as the government focuses its attention on monographs?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Clearly driven by settled policy rather than financial considerations the UK is now determined to press ahead and mandate OA for monographs. Last year </span><a href="https://re.ukri.org/about-us/our-people/steven-hill/"><span>Steven Hill</span></a><span>, Director of Research at UKRI </span><a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/insight/oa-requirement-monographs-will-benefit-society-says-hill-747196"><span>told</span></a><span> <i>The Bookseller</i>that for REF2027 the current policies on open access as applied to journal articles would be extended to encompass monographs and other “long form outputs”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But how much will this cost? How will it be funded? This question has led to some anguished deliberation, by both publishers and researchers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In 2017, for instance, the Pro-Vice Dean Research (Impact and Innovation) at King’s College, Simon Tanner, published a </span><a href="http://simon-tanner.blogspot.com/2017/06/gold-is-dead-model-for-open-access-books.html"><span>blog post</span></a><span> entitled <i>Gold is a dead model for Open Access Books. </i>In the post, he said that Book Processing Charges in a Gold OA environment, “would be utterly unsustainable in a future OA mandated REF environment.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In reaching this conclusion Tanner calculated that there were 11,861 named submitters to Panel D (Arts and Humanities) for REF2014, with 8,513 books. He explained: “So we have 8,513 books submitted to the REF2014 and probably a similar number to the next one as well. The top 3 most book submitting universities were University of Oxford (511), University of Cambridge (344) and King’s College London (245).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Tanner added that BPCs range from between £3,500 to £11,000 per book. As a result, he said, “The maths don’t look good if these figures continued into a new OA mandated REF environment. At the lower end (say £3,000 per book) the figures are scary, at the upper end (say £10,000 per book) the figures are impossible to sustain or contemplate.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This would mean, he said, that Oxford’s 511 books would cost between £1.5 million and £5.1 million to submit to the REF, Cambridge’s 344 books would cost between £1 million and £3.4 million to submit, and King’s 245 books would cost between £0.7 million and £2.5 million to submit. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>If Tanner’s estimates are right, and UKRI does introduce an OA monograph mandate, the UK could face a bill of between £25 and £85 million (using the REF2014 figures). Others might question these figures, but even OA advocate Martin Eve acknowledges that there are </span><a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.392/"><span>significant funding challenges</span></a><span>. And this would be on top of the </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/oa/rcuk-apc-returns-analysis-2016-and-2017-pdf/"><span>millions of pounds</span></a><span> it is already paying to fund journal APCs, a figure that has increased by over 50% since the payments began in 2013. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Currently, the hope is that universities will be able to turn their journal licensing contracts with publishers into “</span><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/"><span>transformative agreements</span></a><span>”. This would see the costs of reading subscription journal content and OA publication charges combined and (UKRI must hope) obviate the need to continue paying block grants. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, this requires the co-operation of publishers and has the potential for being highly disruptive – as researchers at the University of California have discovered following their library’s decision to </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-uc-elsevier-20190711-story.html"><span>walk away</span></a><span> from negotiations over such an agreement with the world’s largest scholarly publisher Elsevier. In response, Elsevier has pulled the plug, leaving faculty without access to newly published papers in thousands of Elsevier journals.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Even if this strategy eventually proves successful for journals, it is unclear how a similar transition process would work for monographs. For this reason, doubtless, UKRI recently </span><a href="https://re.ukri.org/news-events-publications/news/re-awards-2-2m-to-project-to-improve-open-access-publishing/"><span>awarded £2.2m</span></a><span> to a project intended “to make more, and better, use of open access book publishing”. But is there really time to reinvent the monograph publishing landscape before REF2027? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>One model that has gained traction is the so-called crowdfunding solution in which libraries combine funds to “unlock” books and make them open access. But there are problems with this model and – as is evident from recent criticism of </span><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/"><span>Knowledge Unlatched</span></a><span> (e.g. </span><a href="http://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/open-book-publishers-statement-on-knowledge-unlatched-and-the-open-research-library/"><span>here</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html"><span>here</span></a><span>) – there are also unintended consequences. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/7/3/55"><span>This article</span></a><span> draws attention to some of the problems of the crowdfunding model. It also points out that the ongoing efforts to agree transformative agreements with journal publishers, the current focus of UKRI on Plan S, and the large amounts of money already being sucked from the system by journals, pose a big threat to implementing such a model. As the authors put it, “Currently, the focus of libraries and research funders is on journals rather than books. Therefore, Plan S could be a threat as well as other changes in science policy orientation.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It seems to me that there are two underlying and connected problems here. There is an abiding assumption that open access can reduce the costs of scholarly publishing and a continuing desire to press ahead with policy changes without thinking through the cost implications.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It’s as if OA advocates and funders believed that costs can be magically wished away. The truth is that costs do not disappear with open access. Moreover, publishers are not going to willingly lower their prices, and market forces are not sufficient to force them to do so, if only because STM researchers are always going to want to publish in prestigious journals and humanities researchers are always going to want to publish with prestigious imprints. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>True, high-minded statements like The Declaration on Research Assessment (</span><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><span>DORA</span></a><span>) effectively seek to force researchers to abandon this practice (as does Plan S) but this </span><a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181107234431569"><span>raises issues of academic freedom</span></a><span>and leaves researchers more vulnerable to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing"><span>predatory publishing</span></a><span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In short, while King’s College clearly failed Hall in her attempts to publish her new book open access, the larger failing here is a failure of the UK government and UK funders. They have yet to develop a coherent or sustainable strategy for moving to an open-access environment, even as they insist on pressing ahead with new OA policies. This suggests that individuals like Hall can expect the situation to get worse before it gets better.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But there is a little good news to end with: RTF agreed to insert a clause in the new contract with Hall and Stead to allow their book to made open access after a three-year embargo, for a reduced BPC (£3,000). And King’s has agreed to pay the fee.

Where a scientist will write a paper and then send it to a journal publisher for consideration, with humanities monographs the author generally does things the other way round: s/he will propose an idea to a publisher before writing the book. The publisher will likely then send that proposal (the book’s topic and how the topic will be dealt with) out for review. Only once the reviews have been provided, and any recommended changes made to the book proposal (assuming the publisher is still willing to proceed), will the author(s) sit down and write the text (of, say, 200,000 words). Sometimes the completed text will also be sent out for further review before the book is finally cleared for publication.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>This process takes a lot longer than sending a, say, 5,000-word scientific paper to a journal and waiting for it to be reviewed and published (which can sometimes happen within 3 months), especially when the book author(s) is/ are highly research active and working on several other books and projects simultaneously. </span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>In the case of the book we are discussing the text was not finally and fully accepted for publication until June this year, which is when Hall contacted Research Support to ask for the promised BPC to be released (on 22nd June). In its initial response, which was not sent until 12th July, Research Support replied that three years is a long time in open access and that the demand on RCUK funds was now significantly higher. (It later added that it was not in any case permitted to use RCUK funds to pay BPCs). Consequently, it suggested that the Faculty of Arts and Humanities be asked for money to pay the BPC. More than a month after Hall made contact (26th July), the Vice Dean Research said that he could not provide the funds either.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>At this point, Hall had no option but to go back to the publisher and ask to revert to a traditional contract. She then negotiated with the publisher an option that would allow the book to be made OA after three years for a greatly reduced BPC. When she asked Research Support if they would pay this reduced fee they agreed. As such, it is not so much that Research Support eventually secured funds to cover the cost of the BPC, but that it secured a considerably lower sum in order for the book to be released after a three-year embargo. The book will not be freely available until 2023.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>With regard to Research Support having offered a “soft” commitment: when Hall was informed that the money would be made available to her she was told, “As you are funded by AHRC we are prepared to fund the whole cost of publication for your monograph from the RCUK block grant.” There was no indication here that the commitment would expire at some point in the future, or that it was “soft” (whatever that might mean). It would have been reasonable for Hall to assume that at that point the commitment was recorded in some file or document somewhere indicating that the BPC had been promised to her. It would now seem, however, that this is not the case and that King’s operates a first come first served system. More precisely, it sounds like a “first to send an invoice” system rather than a “first to be granted a subvention” system.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>Other universities have been making data about how they are spending their block grants freely available on the web (open access) at the same time as they file the reports to RCUK.

Stop by our booth and say hello! Dr. Karen Root, an Academic Editor for </em>PLOS ONE,<em> will also be in attendance. You can meet her at our booth on Monday, August 12 between 3 and 4pm. Here’s a brief interview with her. </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your area of study and what are you currently working on?</strong><br />
A: I originally began as behavioral ecologist but realized there were real issues in the population that I was studying related to human activities. Conservation biology drew me since it provided a way to utilize my ecological training to directly address some of those issues. My current research focuses on native species and the factors that imperil them, but also on the effects of restoration and management.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What first drew you into the field?</strong><br />
A: I have always been interested in the natural world around me, especially growing up in an urban center. During college I spent a summer at the Itasca Biological Station and fell in love with field work. In graduate school, I grew to appreciate techniques such as spatial analysis and population modeling that complemented the field studies. Conservation biology is a way to integrate all of these approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you share your thoughts on why this type of research is important? How does it affect other areas of research? Other communities?</strong><br />
A: I think of myself as a practical ecologist–basic ecological research is important but there are issues that need to be addressed. When I can demonstrate the societal value of my research, I receive more support, collaboration is more likely, and scientists and non-scientists alike are more receptive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long have you been an editor on <em>PLOS ONE</em>? What have you enjoyed most about it?</strong><br />
A: I have only been an editor for a year, but it has been a very interesting experience and I have learned so much more about science communication.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is <em>PLOS ONE</em> important to you and the ecology community?</strong><br />
A: I appreciate the inclusivity of <em>PLOS ONE</em>. It is very tempting to focus on one aspect of ecology or a particular subdiscipline but you would miss out on all of the other interesting research out there that can strengthen your own science.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What advice would you give to authors in your field who are getting ready to submit their work?</strong><br />
A: Read broadly. If I can understand a paper that is not in my area of expertise, then I can learn something important about how to write more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most looking forward to while attending ESA?</strong><br />
A: One of my favorite aspects of ESA is the chance to catch up on the latest advances not only in ecological science but also education.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there any trends in your field right now that you’re hoping to learn more about?</strong><br />
A: There are so many new ways to communicate about science and become more effective.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?</strong><br />
A: Problem solving requires cooperation, coordination and large amounts of data to be truly effective. Open Science can facilitate these aspects as well as increase the diversity of participants and disciplines in the process.</p>

An investigation into participation in No Lights, No Lycra and its association with health and wellbeing</a></strong></p>
<p>Dancing is a performing art form whereby participants move their body in time to a rhythm (usually music). It is a physical activity that has been associated with improving fitness and physical wellbeing. An activity often enjoyed in childhood, it often falls away as we get older and relatively few people participate once they reach adulthood.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11177 alignleft" height="212" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/cheers-204742_1920-300x212.jpg" width="300" />
<p><a href="https://www.nolightsnolycra.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No lights, no lycra (NLNL)</a> is a global dance community that allows participants to indulge in free form dancing in the dark, providing a non-judgmental, inclusive and drug and alcohol free environment. It’s an activity that has gained popularity.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Foley <em>et al</em> have recently looked into the sort of people who participate in this activity. They collected information on their demographic characteristics, physical activity levels, motivations for doing the activity and what impact NLNL has had on their health and well-being.</p>
<p>This investigation was performed via a self-report online survey where each participant was asked to describe their experiences and motivations. This revealed that NLNL mostly attracts adult women who, by and large, are not particularly fit and have not historically engaged in much organised physical activity before.</p>
<p>This illustrates how an organised physical activity can be modified to appeal to a population that would not have otherwise been interested and highlights the need to understand how such modifications can motivate and maintain the engagement of people who would typically be inactive.</p>

<p>In 2015, countries in the European Union (EU) experienced an influx of over a million refugees and migrants; the so-called refugee crisis.</p>
<p>This resulted in an increase in migratory pressures; providing care for the most vulnerable groups created some significant challenges. In essence, refugees and migrants frequently found themselves with no effective healthcare. As a response to this, a study was performed by Chiarenza and colleagues to inform the development of a “resource package”, aiming to improve such access. This involved conducting interviews and focus groups in order to collect up-to-date information on the challenges different healthcare provides faced in relation to the refugee crisis, as well as a literature review on barriers to healthcare access and possible solutions.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11178 alignright" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/humanitarian-aid-939723_1280-300x218.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Researchers found that the barriers faced by refugees and migrants were due to challenges related to whether they had just arrived to a EU country, were in transit or whether they have reached their final destination. These challenges created, for example, legislative, financial and administrative barriers to healthcare, lack of reliable information on the health status of individuals, lack of knowledge of entitlements and what help was available, and lack of organization and co-ordination between different services. These issues were particularly acute when trying to access mental health, sexual health, child services or victim of violence care services.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that working with solutions developed to deal with emergencies often create a system that is both chaotic and fragmented, distracting from the need to develop changes in the EU health system to prevent vulnerable people from accessing healthcare.</p>

<p>Information technology (IT) has changed many aspects of how we communicate. This, in turn, has had a considerable impact on education, providing the means, for example, to access a wide range of multimedia learning resources. There are questions however surrounding whether there is enough evidence supporting the benefits of using IT tools for medical education and, in particular, whether the advance of learning in medical education is driven more by social behavior and cheap technology than improvement in outcomes.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11179 alignleft" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/whatsapp-3012138_1920-300x225.png" width="300" />
<p>Coleman and O’Conner recently performed a scoping review of a popular messaging and voice over IP service, WhatsApp, the aim of which being to see how it is used and evaluated as a tool in medical education. They performed two searches of the published literature, using the term “WhatsApp” as the search term. They discovered that WhatsApp was being used in implementing one of three different strategies – namely educational use with a pre-defined curriculum, educational use without a curriculum, or a primarily non-educational use.</p>
<p>There were some reports of an improvement in the learners knowledge after using WhatsApp as a learning tool, but there was little evidence for any learning theory being used. Coleman and O’Conner have taken the three strategies for WhatsApp use and developed their own model that draws on the Dabbagh and Bannan-Ritland’s exploration-enactment-evaluation learning design framework for online education, from which they propose their own instant messenger design model for medical education.</p>

<p>Brain development, in particular the expansion of brain tissue and development of advanced cognitive skills are characteristic of human evolution. It has been linked to nutrients that promote such development, including iodine. Rich sources of this critical nutrient can be found primarily in coastal areas. This thus raises the question of how early hominins in continental areas could have met their iodine requirements.</p>
<p>One way to try and answer this question is to study how hominoid primates today are able to source these nutrients.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11104 alignright" height="207" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/bonobos-fishingCGB-300x200.png" width="311" />
<p>Bonobos are only found in the central region of the Congo basin, an area considered to be somewhat iodine deficient.</p>
<p>Hohmann and colleagues measured the mineral content of the fruit, terrestrial and aquatic herbs in the area, which showed that it was the aquatic herbs that contained most iodine and, importantly, two species in particular had iodine concentrations almost equivalent to that found in marine algae. This challenges the assumption that the Congo basin is iodine deficient and shows that it offers natural sources of the nutrient in concentrations high enough to prevent iodine deficiency in hominoids and humans.</p>

<p>Even though it is only three steps, it could still be made simpler. What if we
could have a Fedora Remix that you could simply download and use?</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-fedora-spin-lab">
<h2>What is a Fedora Spin/Lab?</h2>
<p>The Fedora community produces three "editions" that are featured on
<a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">https://getfedora.org</a>. However, these are not all! The community is full of
volunteers with different interests, and so we also produce lots of secondary
products---Fedora <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org">Spins</a> and Fedora <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org">Labs</a>. They are both downloadable images
like the Fedora editions, with the difference being that they are contain
different software sets.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org">Spins</a> for example, include different default
desktop environments: KDE, LXDE, LXQT, and so on. The <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org">Labs</a> consist of
different "functional bundles", for different target audiences: Astronomy,
Design, Games, Security, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neurofedora-lab">
<h2>NeuroFedora Lab?</h2>
<p>So, the plan now is to have a similar downloadable image for <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>. If
not a single image, maybe two: one each for the two main functional classes:
one for computational modelling, and one for neuroimaging. So, effectively that
will mean the process would become even simpler for users:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download the image (and optionally install it).</li>
<li>Get to work!</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's why installing is optional. All Fedora images are "Live". This means
that you don't really need to install them to use them. You can boot into them
off a USB drive and use them straight away---without installing them on a
computer.  This could be very very useful for tutorials and hackathons where
the organisers could have a bunch of these images ready for users to work on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-are-looking-for-a-spin-lab-master">
<h2>We are looking for a Spin/Lab master</h2>
<p>So, we are looking for someone to manage the image. We have a small team
already, but we would like to keep the team focussed on including more
software---<a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=T%3A+Software">there are still 160 tools in queue</a>.</p>
<p>The Spin/Lab master shall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>help decide what tools should be included in the image,</li>
<li>lead the effort by using existing Fedora community infrastructure to create
the images,</li>
<li>ensure the images are always functional and ready to use,</li>
<li>poke the rest of the team when needed to fix issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time commitment would be: 2-3 hours a week.</p>
<p>What skills do you need for this? None---like all other tasks, you can learn on
the go. In general, you will use/learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Git (since most things in Fedora now use Git),</li>
<li>how to create a "kickstart" recipe---the configuration file that defines what
the image contains. This is very well documented and mostly, you only have to
copy paste the recipe off another image and tweak it.</li>
<li>how to use the Fedora community infrastructure to build these images---this
is also quite easy since there are helper tools for all of it. All you have
to do is run the commands in the right order.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite an easy role, and there are lots of people in the Fedora community
who would be happy to help when needed. There is a whole <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Spins_SIG">Spins Special
Interest Group (SIG)</a>, as a matter
of fact. The toughest bit would be learning the process that is to be followed.</p>
<p>Does that sound interesting? Do you want to learn new skills and help us make
<a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> better and easier for neuroscience enthusiasts? Have any

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/thrivership-cover-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Why is this study important?</strong></h3>
<p>Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a serious public health issue, threatening the health of individuals the world over. While men can also experience DVA, women are disproportionately affected. Around <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30% of women worldwide</a> who have been in a romantic relationship report having experienced violence at the hands of their partner, and in the UK <a href="https://1q7dqy2unor827bqjls0c4rn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Femicide-Census-of-2017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a woman is killed</a> by her current or former male partner every four days.</p>
<h3><strong>What is thrivership?</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of our study was to explore the concept of ‘thrivership’ with women who have experienced DVA. Thrivership is an emerging field and refers to the progression of the victim from surviving DVA to truly overcoming the trauma of abuse. Following <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-98440-000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gondolf and Fisher’s ‘survivor theory’</a> in the late 1980s, ‘survivor’ replaced ‘victim’ as the preferred term to refer to individuals who have experienced DVA.  Although originally viewed as a positive shift, this terminology was not optimal for a number of reasons. ‘Survivor’ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399339509516194" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">centralizes abuse</a> in the lives of affected individuals, serving as a reminder of past negative experiences and thus hindering full recovery. It also fails to explore the more long-term recovery from abuse, focusing instead on more-immediate freedom.</p>
<p>‘Thrivership’ offers a resolution to these issues: it denotes prosperity and growth on an upward trajectory. Ultimately, our goal should be to eliminate DVA. In the meantime, however, public health professionals should strive to empower and support women to thrive after long-term after abuse, not simply – and in some cases barely – survive the experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s very easy to move from being a victim to survivor to thinking that you’re there and thriving and then it’s… so easy for that to be knocked right back to the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several studies over the past 15 years provide some insight into thriving post-DVA, predominantly as a transformative process rather than an outcome. Beyond this, though, available literature on thriving offers little information about how women can be supported through this process. We are left wondering what thriving means to women beyond a spiritual or theory-based experience. What are the practical implications of thrivership? What do women need to thrive? How can healthcare professionals provide support and services to facilitate thrivership?</p>
<h3><strong>What did we do?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2018, we conducted a qualitative study consisting of six focus groups and four in-depth interviews with thirty-seven women. Participants were recruited from a domestic abuse charity in Birmingham, England, which provides empowerment and recovery programs for women who have experienced DVA. Participants were from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, faiths, and age groups. All had experienced abuse by a male intimate partner.</p>
<p>Discussions during data collection explored women’s thoughts about the progression from ‘victim’ to ‘survivor’, then ‘survivor’ to ‘thriver’; how they viewed the recovery process; what thriving post-abuse featured or meant to them; and what could be done to encourage thrivership post-abuse. Data were analysed thematically.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we find?</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings show that there are clear differences between the victim, survivor, and thriver ‘stages’ for women, ranging from highly negative connotations through to very positive. During the victim stage, women said they had “no self-esteem” and felt “powerless” and “isolated.” During the survivor stage they had “escaped” and felt “freedom” but experienced “guilt” and “hardships.” By the thriver stage women reported that they experienced “acceptance,” felt “free,” had developed “self-confidence,” and were “in control” of their lives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all women reported that the thrivership process was fluid; it was easy for something or someone to “knock you off your thriver line,” although this became less frequent over time. As one participant put it: “I’ve been through everything in a year… and it’s very easy to move from being a victim to survivor to thinking that you’re there and thriving and then it’s… so easy for that to be knocked right back to the beginning.” Long-term, flexible support for survivors and a wider change in societal awareness were therefore highlighted as important by participants.</p>

<h3><strong>The Thrivership Model</strong></h3>
<p>Thriving was ultimately characterized by a positive and forward-looking outlook, improved health and well-being, a reclamation of the self, and new social networks. Three key components were crucial to ensuring women reached thrivership, which we propose as the Thrivership Model (Figure 1): (1) Provision of Safety, (2) Sharing the Story, (3) Social Response. These components are underpinned by vital education and building of awareness at different levels. The Thrivership Model illustrates what is required from DVA-services and public health practitioners to facilitate thrivership.</p>

<h3><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></h3>
<p>We would like to thank the <a href="https://birminghamfreedomproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Birmingham Freedom Project (BFP)</a> for working with us on this project. The BFP delivers a unique combination of awareness and empowerment programs for women affected by DVA. Programs are delivered by two female facilitators who have also experienced abuse themselves. The service offers long-term support to women who attend their programs, and free, unlimited access to services. The project’s ongoing support was cited as integral to women’s continuing progress, as was the benefit of being able to meet and talk with others who have experienced abuse.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The 2015 World Alzheimer <a href="https://www.alz.co.uk/research/WorldAlzheimerReport2015.pdf">Report</a> on the global impact of dementia states there are over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, which implies one new case every 3.2 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2015, the estimated number of people living with dementia was 22.9 million in Asia, 10.5 million in Europe, 4 million in Africa, and 9.4 million in the Americas. As baby boomers reach older age, numbers are set to double every twenty years.</p>
<p>The statistics made for disturbing reading and the 2015 report on dementia sums up how many of us feel:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dementia is highly stigmatised and universally feared. It is often perceived as a normal part of ageing, and that no actions can be taken to prevent or treat it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Although stats vary by country, <em>your</em> absolute risk is probably not as high as you fear.</h2>
<p>In the UK, about two in 100 (two per cent) of people aged between sixty-five to sixty-nine have dementia; this figure rises to one in five (twenty per cent) for those aged between eighty-five to eighty-nine.</p>
<p>The majority of centenarian studies report rates of dementia in the extremely old as sitting somewhere between forty-five and sixty-five per cent, with the Sydney Centenarian Study finding rates are consistent with this finding.</p>
<p>On the upside, eighty per cent of people in their eighties, and nearly half of centenarians remain dementia-free.</p>
<p>So contrary to popular belief, dementia is <em>not</em> a natural or inevitable consequence of ageing.</p>
<h2>Dementia is a disease, and while there is no cure, there are steps you can take to tip the brain health scales in your favour.</h2>
<p>In late 2015, an international team <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26294005">pooled data</a> from 323 studies including over 5000 people and ninety-three identified factors thought to influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease, many of which also increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. The most significant harm was heavy smoking, whereas healthy diet was protective.</p>
<p>A total of nine modifiable harms were identified that caused sixty-six per cent of AD cases globally.</p>
<h2>For men and women the 9 modifiable risk factors for AD were:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Being obese</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Carotid atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Low education (not completing secondary school)</li>
<li>High total homocysteine level</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Frailty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly for women, oestrogen therapy, which included the oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy, <em>protected</em> against AD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26294005">paper</a> concluded with a startling statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two in three dementia cases worldwide are preventable.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More women than men develop Alzheimer’s or other dementias.</h2>
<p>In September 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released a<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3303.0"> report</a> stating dementia is the leading cause of death among Australian women. For men, dementia took out number two spot, right behind heart disease. The ABS warn that as treatments for heart disease improve, and men live longer, healthier lives, dementia will likely surpass heart disease as the leading cause of death for men too.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential biological and social reasons for this fact.</p>
<p>One prevailing view that, on average, women live longer than men, and getting older is the greatest risk factor for AD. Or to put it simply – there are more older women alive than old men, so there are more cases of AD.</p>
<p>A related reason is men’s ‘survival bias’. Men have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and stroke than women, so those men who live to old age tend to be much healthier than women of the same age and therefore have lesser risks of developing AD.</p>
<p>Another well-known genetic risk factor for AD is the gene APOE-e4. A 2017 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846757">meta-analysis</a> of nearly 58,000 people found women with particular versions of the APOE-e4 may be more likely to develop AD than men, but only between the ages of ages 65 and 75 years.</p>
<p>One final reason often given to account for the sex difference in risk is low education in women. The more years schooling you received, the lower your risk of developing AD, and the fact women born before the 1950s completed fewer years schooling than men may have rendered their brains more vulnerable to the disease.</p>
<p>We are privileged to live in a world where life expectancy is increasing; and the ageing population, which worries so many people, is actually one of humanity’s greatest achievements.</p>
<h2>Dementia has become humanity’s brain health problem.</h2>

The brain is buzzing with gamma oscillations - cycles of neuronal activity with a frequency (around 40-60 Hz) higher than that of other major brain waves.



A longstanding hypothesis is that gamma serves as a kind of 'clock signal' that enables the coordination and integration of signals. Gamma has even been proposed as the mechanism by which the brain 'binds' information from different brain areas into a unitary consciousness.



However, while the gamma-clock hypothesis is intriguing, direct

<img alt="Sheep in Norway" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Sheep-Norway-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h4>Tell us about paratuberculosis, what is it, how does it spread and how does it affect animals and humans?</h4>
<p>Paratuberculosis, or Johne’s disease, is caused by bacteria (<em>Mycobacterium avium, </em>subspecies <em>paratuberculosis</em>) similar to the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) in animals and humans. Paratuberculosis mainly affects the intestine whereas TB usually affects the lungs. This important difference means that paratuberculosis is mainly spread through feces whereas TB is mainly spread by coughing.</p>
<p>Paratuberculosis commonly affects ruminants, including cattle, sheep, goats, and deer, but a wide range of domestic and wild animals are also susceptible to the disease. We believe that most livestock become infected up to the age of about two years, with the main risk period being the first weeks of life.</p>
<p>The infection begins with the bacteria penetrating the lining of the gut and then spreading to other organs through the blood and lymphatic systems. The bacteria can be shed in the feces and in milk. Here, young animals can easily become infected by accidentally consuming bacteria from colostrum or milk or by ingesting feces, for example off of a dirty teat or from pasture. The bacteria then multiply inside special immune cells called macrophages, disabling them by causing them to clump together. This can cause the bowel to thicken, leading to chronic problems with bowel function and weight loss, and eventually the death of 10-20% of infected animals.</p>

<p>Paratuberculosis bacteria can also infect humans. Some researchers believe that the bacteria could be involved in the development of Crohn’s disease (a chronic inflammatory bowel disease). Paratuberculosis bacteria <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.20967" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been isolated from the intestines of children with Crohn’s disease</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360417058X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blood of Crohn’s disease patients</a> but it’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S095026881500076X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not certain whether these bacteria cause Crohn’s disease</a>.</p>
<h4>Your study collated a considerable amount of data from 48 countries worldwide, how did you build such an extensive network of researchers to produce this work?</h4>
<p>The research team was built by something called “snowball sampling”, a method typically used by social science surveys. However, it seemed to be a good way to find “rare” experts from around the world, to expand my network of contacts. I guessed that other people would know different experts, and those experts would know others. This process was closely supervised, by setting out criteria for formal inclusion in the study team and sending regular updates to keep everything on track.</p>
<p>To collect the data for our study, paratuberculosis experts were asked to complete a survey which collected data from their own countries. The survey was successful with around 80% of experts invited agreeing to take part, with a very low dropout rate. I think everyone believed it was an important topic and had the same questions in their minds as I did. The time from the original concept for the study to publication of the paper was about 18 months.</p>
<h4>The survey was completed by experts in the paratuberculosis field, what were their experiences of taking part?</h4>
<blockquote><p>In the absence of national control programs, prevalence and severity continue to increase in the huge ruminant population. This study establishes Johne’s disease as a ‘global emergency’ facing domestic livestock.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was very clear to me that our colleagues in other developing countries were delighted to have been invited to participate and to have their contributions valued, here are some of their thoughts on the project:</p>
<p>“This was very easy to agree to be part of because the topic is “one of my babies” and it was likely that the orchestration of the project would see it completed” –<strong>Søren Nielsen</strong></p>
<p>“For those of us working with control programs, we share lots of information informally.  It’s nice to have a published manuscript that we can cite when we refer to the work that we do.” –<strong>David Kelton</strong></p>
<p>“It was a great experience to be part of such a broad and inclusive team writing this paper. Even though our backgrounds are pretty variable, we are globally facing the same challenges and uncertainties in controlling paratuberculosis. Thus, colleagues from around the globe do recognize that cooperation rather than competition is the way forward. The team was very much prepared to share available knowledge, information, and experiences.” –<strong>Maarten Weber</strong></p>
<p>“It was a great experience to be part of this first international initiative to get a picture of 48 countries. In the absence of national control programs, prevalence and severity continue to increase in the huge ruminant population. This study establishes Johne’s disease as a ‘global emergency’ facing domestic livestock.” –<strong>Shoor Vir Singh</strong></p>
<p>“When informing stakeholders about paratuberculosis control it is good to be able to tell them what has been done already and what was learned by the different approaches. This might help to streamline a new control program and to avoid mistakes which have been already made by others”. –<strong>Suzanne Eisenberg</strong></p>
<h4>Your study found that in around half of the countries surveyed, 20% of herds and flocks were infected with paratuberculosis. How does the treatment of this disease compare with other livestock diseases?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Paratuberculosis is of great concern because there is no treatment, it builds up over time and can reach high levels of prevalence within a herd or flock. It spreads between herds and flocks and it does not die out by itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a complex question. Infectious diseases can be divided into those that are exotic (do not regularly occur in a country or region but pop up once in a while) or endemic (occur in a lot of herds most of the time). There are common diseases that affect almost every herd or flock from time to time, but there are often treatments or vaccines to prevent these and so they are considered to be routine matters for farmers (examples include internal parasitic diseases, clostridial diseases, and mastitis).</p>
<p>In comparison, paratuberculosis is of great concern because there is no treatment, it builds up over time and can reach high levels of prevalence within a herd or flock. It spreads between herds and flocks and it does not die out by itself. Over time the impacts of production loss and mortality worsen. It takes years for this to occur and so it can go unnoticed until infection rates are quite high. Therefore, livestock trade during this long incubation period can enhance the spread of disease.</p>
<h4>What do you think are the main barriers and facilitators to the control of paratuberculosis?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Paratuberculosis control could be greatly enhanced if vaccines were adopted more widely.</p></blockquote>
<p>While a lack of accurate diagnostic tests is often cited as a barrier, a larger one is a lack of leadership at national and international levels. Many developing countries look to the <a href="http://www.oie.int/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)</a> for guidance on disease priorities and approaches to control. For paratuberculosis, there is no international code, creating the impression that the disease is ‘not important’.</p>
<p>For developed countries, with high rates of paratuberculosis, it is convenient not to have any specific international guidelines because they can continue to sell live animals to any country prepared to accept their livestock. Import testing requirements are set at the importing-country level and sometimes they are meaningless. For example, young animals with subclinical infections are likely to test negative and so can be imported.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11159" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Farmer checking on cattle" class="wp-image-11159 size-large" height="274" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/15636971561_b9776a3e6d_k-1024x438.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: CGIAR Climate</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Paratuberculosis control could be greatly enhanced if vaccines were adopted more widely. The existing commercial vaccines are quite effective <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02882.x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but can cause interference with TB skin testing</a>. This is something that requires international guidance as well as research and development of better tests for TB.</p>
<h4>In your study, you found that of the countries surveyed, 22 had formal control programs. How can these countries support others without formal control programs in place?</h4>
<blockquote><p>There is an urgent need for a set of generic guidelines developed by experts that can be refined according to each country’s unique needs and practices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The design of control programs and the experiences amongst countries were often quite different, varying according to the burden of disease, animal husbandry practices, and the diverse ways that animal disease control is organized locally. But there is great expertise that could be leveraged if some method of formal coordination was in place.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for a set of generic guidelines developed by experts that can be refined according to each country’s unique needs and practices. There is already an initiative from the dairy industry called the “<a href="https://store.fil-idf.org/product/bulletin-idf-n-493-2018-proceedings-6th-paratuberculosis-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ParaTB Forum</a>” which has provided a nice opportunity for sharing experiences between countries, but this needs to be expanded to cover all types of livestock.</p>
<p>There may also be an opportunity to link paratuberculosis control activity with TB control in the future. This would be an efficient use of human resources because both require a great deal of on-farm work, individual animal testing, and interaction with farmers.</p>
<h4>You mention that different countries have different objectives for controlling the disease, with some Scandinavian countries aiming to eradicate it. Do you think this will be achievable in the long term?</h4>
<p>Yes, but this depends on several factors, for example, the amount of trade between herds in the population. Eradication has been confirmed in practice and is predicted by modeling. Sweden appears to have achieved eradication and maintained freedom from paratuberculosis infection. It is in a uniquely favorable position by using this form of surveillance strategy, and it is true that Norway is in a similar position. Other countries like Japan have implemented strong measures designed to get the bacterium out of the food chain, since every cow on farms in Japan must be tested.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11166" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Sheep" class="wp-image-11166 size-medium" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/sheep-2625347_960_720-300x201.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Soure: Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Vaccination of sheep has been very effective in reducing the disease to negligible levels (but not zero), confirmed through <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rigorous long-term studies</a>. Initially, it is important to implement control measures to reduce the burden of the disease before thinking about eradication. Eradication may be possible in some countries, but realistically this should only be a long-term goal. The rate of exchange of animals between herds is so high that eradication will not be feasible unless the industry is prepared to reform and strongly reduce the trade of individual animals between herds.</p>
<h4>What steps can farmers living in countries without formal control programs take to protect their livestock?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Farmers should be formally educated about the precautions they should take when purchasing replacement livestock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paratuberculosis is a problem but it ranks quite low in terms of farmer interest and focus. Farmers should be formally educated about the precautions they should take when purchasing replacement livestock. Advice could include that it is best to purchase animals from farms that are demonstrated to have a high probability of freedom of paratuberculosis through objective certification of the entire herd /flock, rather than to buy individual “test negative” animals from farms of unknown status. Nevertheless, these certification programs exist in only some countries.</p>
