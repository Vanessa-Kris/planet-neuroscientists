If the answer is “no,” you are not alone. Two-thirds of adults fail to obtain the recommended 8 hours of nightly sleep. I doubt you are surprised by the answer to this question, but you may be surprised by the consequences. This talk will describe not only the good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don’t get enough. The presentation will focus on the brain (learning, memory aging, Alzheimer’s disease, education), but further highlight disease-related consequences in the body (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The take-home: sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset the health of our brains and bodies.</blockquote><br />Why sleep, indeed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, <a href="http://foals.co.uk/everythingnotsavedwillbelost" target="_blank">Foals</a> are playing tonight at <a href="http://thefoxoakland.com/" target="_blank">The Fox Theater</a> in Oakland.

<p>Recently popularized by a certain populist political figure the phrase ‘Fake News’ has entered the global public lexicon and is routinely weaponized in the arenas of internet debate.</p>
<p>Hoffman presents a debate examining how, for controversial topics, some researchers can be biased towards publishing only positive conclusions whilst others only publish negative conclusions, even when these conclusions use the same data.</p>
<p>The controversial topic for this debate is the efficacy of mammography screening in the detection of breast cancer.   The debate identified 8 manuscripts which studied mammography accuracy and then, through consultation with experts in polarized research, ranked the attitudes of the corresponding authors towards screening.</p>
<p>It was found that the efficacy of the screening reported in the manuscripts correlated with the ranked attitudes of the corresponding authors, suggesting that personal views were influencing the scientific record.</p>
<p>Advice on how Editors, Reviewers and Researchers can handle conflicts of interest are found within the article’s conclusion.  For instance Editors should take into account the personal biases of researchers when inviting them for peer-review.</p>
<p>And, with no conflicts of interest whatsoever to declare, it is the position of Liam and Lingling that this is probably the best article on how personal views can influence research published ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0257-6"><u>Difficulties in administering Euthanasia to patients with Intellectual disabilities</u></a></p>
<p>Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) has been legally possible in the Netherlands since 2001 provided the following criteria are met</p>
<ol>
<li>The request is voluntary;</li>
<li>The patient’s suffering is unbearable, with no prospect for improvement;</li>
<li>The patient is fully informed of the prospect of euthanasia;</li>
<li>There is no, reasonable, alternative treatment available</li>
<li>At least one other physician, independent of the one assisting, provides an opinion concurring with the decision</li>
</ol>
<p>Discussions on EAS legislation for vulnerable people, especially for those with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, are sparse.</p>
<p>The authors analyzed 9 case summaries, published between 2012-2016, concerning either intellectual disability or autism and EAS. The authors conclude that the above criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities or autism.</p>
<p>A specialist intellectual disability physician is suggested to be involved in all cases where someone with an intellectual disability requests EAS, and that all physicians involved in capacity assessments of patients with intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorder (including those offering a second opinion) must have enhanced training in this area.</p>
<p>Globally, sufficient measures to protect vulnerable patients should be carefully considered while planning to introduce or adapt EAS legislation.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0260-y"><u>Is it ethical to include patients in research?</u></a></p>
<p>Traditionally, research is conducted <em>on</em> patients, however increasingly research is being performed with patients collaborating with the investigators.  This phenomenon is termed Patient Engaged Research (PER). At present the ethical issues involved with PER have been largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a three-round Delphi survey with a panel of early-career researchers (ECRs) from various backgrounds, ranging from general practitioners to postgraduate students to identify ethical issues.</p>
<p>Experienced ECRs were more worried about the applied aspects of PER, such as patient remuneration, recognition of patient contributions and confidentiality. In contrast, junior researchers were concerned with theoretical issues, such as power dynamics between researchers and patients and the exploitation of vulnerable persons. However, both junior and senior ECRs felt inadequately prepared to address the ethical issues despite their overall readiness to conduct PER.</p>
<p>Without the establishment of clear ethical standards for PER, the authors fear that the credibility of PER will suffer and its adoption of as a research practice may be inhibited.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0268-3"><u>Conscientious objection to abortion by midwives and nurses</u></a></p>
<p>Abortion remains a morally contentious issue, and some midwives and nurses might decline to recommend it on the grounds that it conflicts with their personally held religious or ethical beliefs. Fleming <em>et al</em> conducted a systematic review to identify the views of midwives and nurses on the right to object to the provision of an abortion.</p>
<p>Nurses’ and midwives’ views were classified as ‘Moral’, ‘Legal’, ‘Practical or ‘Religious’.  Interestingly all of the manuscripts included in the review, despite being focused on the views of nurses and midwives were written exclusively by physicians, philosophers, legal scholars and lawyers.</p>
<p>81 reasons for midwives and nurses to consciously object to abortion provision were identified.  The most common reason for objection was that one’s conscience is an ‘inner voice that [needs] to be listened to’ and that ‘Religious law should be followed’.</p>
<p>Reasons against conscientious objection were also highlighted with the most popular being that health care providers must separate ‘moral belief from [their] professional life’ and that women have a right to access abortions.</p>
<p>A plurality of reasons both for and against the ability of midwives and nurses to refuse to recommend abortions was unearthed but also, and perhaps more importantly, was the dearth of written work directly from these very professions on the topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0333-y"><u>First things first, the ethics of prioritizing global health research</u></a></p>
<p>Time is finite and it is rarely possible to clear one’s inbox let alone address the myriad of health issues which ravage the globe.  As a result the prioritization of which research questions should be tackled first is of upmost importance to policy makers, researchers and ethicists.</p>
<p>The act of prioritizing, itself, is an ethical consideration; for instance should the world’s governments, charities and philanthropists focus more on infectious disease research than on, say, curtailing obesity?</p>
<p>Pratt <em>et al</em>, report on the outcomes of an International Workshop entitled ‘<a href="https://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/web/5/Ethics-of-Global-Health-Research-Priority-Setting-Workshop.html">Ethics of Global Health Research Priority</a>’ held in Oxford.  Global health and ethics experts gathered to discuss the ethical considerations of prioritizing global health research.</p>
<p>The attendees’ reflections have been summarized as 8 research questions such as; “which groups should initiate and lead global health research priority settings?” and “what is the right process for making decisions at this wide world level?”</p>
<p>This report serves as a guide and as a source of impetus for ethicists, researchers and policymakers to develop ethically sound and robust approaches to setting priorities</p>

<p>Of the main personality traits, Neuroticism (characterised by emotional instability and lack of resilience) is probably the one with the least going for it. High scorers on this trait are impulsive, tend to worry a lot, and they struggle with low moods and short tempers. Thanks to personality research, we know a lot about what lies in store for people who score high on Neuroticism, such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/02/your-personality-may-affect-your-vulnerability-to-mental-health-problems/">increased risk of mental health problems</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161205-how-break-ups-change-your-personality">relationship turmoil</a>. But as Robert Klein and Michael Robinson note in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12469">new paper</a> in <em>Journal of Personality</em> we know a lot less about the psychological processes that underlie the trait. From an emotional perspective, neurotic people are said to be more sensitive to threat and punishment, but what about the cognitive side? Across four studies, Klein and Robinson present evidence consistent with what they call the <em>mental noise hypothesis</em> – “neurotic people have noisier, more chaotic mental control systems”, they write.</p>
<p><span id="more-36790"></span></p>
<p>The four studies involved hundreds of undergrad students, who filled out personality questionnaires and then took part in a simple tracking task, in which they had to use a computer mouse or joystick to track a horizontally moving on-screen target with their cursor as accurately as possible. Each tracking trial, of which there were up to 60 per person, lasted between 30 seconds or as little as 5 seconds.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to examine participants’ tracking accuracy with high temporal precision, using the task to assess “micro-momentary disconnections between the mind and its control of the external environment”. Given the shortness of the trials, plus the fact the task did not require storing or manipulating information in working memory, and that there was no need to adjust to different instructions, Klein and Robinson said it was too simple and easy to be considered an “executive function” task (involving more complex mental processes) and was instead best characterised as a “form of mindfulness task that requires intention, attention and awareness concerning a simple activity”.</p>
<p>Notably, previous research has found an inverse correlation between trait Neuroticism and trait Mindfulness – neurotic folk are often so fretful and distracted with worry about the past and future that they find it difficult to be in the present. However, according to past findings, this distracted state doesn’t manifest in lower IQ or worse job performance. This paradox may be explained by neurotic people compensating by investing more effort than average, the researchers suggested (after all, anxiety-prone people would hate to fail or underperform). Part of the rationale for the tracking task, then, was that it would be so simple that performance would not vary with greater effort – in a sense providing the researchers with a pure measure of their participants’ mental control, or what you could think of as their levels of mental noise.</p>
<p>True to their predictions, the researchers found that across all the studies, higher scorers in Neuroticism were less accurate at tracking the on-screen targets. Also, the link between Neuroticism and poorer performance was consistent, being no greater during earlier or later trials (discounting the influence of factors like fatigue).  “A task with excellent temporal resolution appears to possess considerable value in documenting the sorts of lapses and slips thought to be somewhat endemic to neurotic forms of self-regulation”, the researchers said. In contrast, the other main personality traits, such as Extraversion and Conscientiousness, were not associated with performance.</p>
<p>The researchers also blasted the participants with annoying loud white noise at periodic intervals, to see if this had a greater adverse effect on more neurotic participants. Although the noise blasts impaired performance (affecting accuracy for about a second), the degree of impairment wasn’t any greater for more neurotic people. This may be because the distraction of the noise was so immediate and unavoidable that personality differences were not relevant.</p>
<p>In the final study, after completing the tracking task, participants were also asked to keep a two-week daily diary of their feelings of distress and nervousness, as well as any daily stressors, such as feeling like they had too much to do. Poorer performance on the tracking task correlated with more frequent daily experiences of negative emotional states, regardless of any actual stressors. Klein and Robinson said this was consistent with their task being a kind of implicit personality measure: “even brief lapses of attention can reflect the sorts of processes that give rise to longer term affective consequences,” they said.</p>
<p>If the researchers are correct in their characterisation of Neuroticism – and we need more studies with more diverse participant samples to test their theory – it could open up avenues for interventions to increase emotional stability, for example through <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/01/working-memory-training-could-help-beat-anxiety/">training to increase mental control</a> and so reduce mental noise.</p>

Are we improving society in some way? Adding to a collective body of knowledge that may (or may not) be the key to explaining behavior and curing disease? Although still difficult, Dr. Davachi posed an easier question, “what are your goals?” To describe behavior, predict behavior (correlation), explain behavior (causation), change behavior (manipulation)? But “what counts as an explanation?” I don't think anyone really answered that question. Instead she mentioned the recurring themes of <i><b>levels of analysis </b></i>(without invoking Marr by name), <i><b>emergent properties</b></i> (the flock of birds analogy), and <b><i>bridging laws</i></b> (that link levels of analysis). The correct level of analysis is/are the one(s) that advance your goals. But what to do about “level chauvinism” in contemporary neuroscience? This question was raised again and again.<br /><br /><b>(2) <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/" target="_blank">Dr. Jennifer Groh</a></b> jumped right out of the gate with this motif. There are competing narratives in neuroscience we can call the electrode level (recording from neurons) vs. the neuroimaging level (recording large-scale brain activations or “network” interactions based on an indirect measure of neural activity). They make different assumptions about what is significant or worth studying. I found this interesting, since her lab is the only one that records from actual neurons. But there are ever more reductionist scientists who always throw stones at those above them. Neurobiologists (at the electrode level and below) are operating at ever more granular levels of detail, walking away from cognitive neuroscience entirely (who wants to be a dualist, anyway?). I knew exactly where she was going with this: the field is being driven by techniques, doing experiments merely because you can (cough — <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/optogenetics" target="_blank" title="HOW TO PUBLISH IN NATURE">OPTOGENETICS</a> — cough). Speaking for myself, however, the fact that neurobiologists can control mouse behavior by manipulating highly specific populations of cells raises the specter of insecurity... certain areas of research might not be considered “neuroscience” any more by a bulk of practitioners in the field (just attend the <a href="http://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a> annual meeting).<br /><br /><b>(3) <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/people/faculty.catherine-alexandra-hartley.html" target="_blank">Dr. Catherine Hartley</a></b> continued with the recurring theme that we need both <i><b>prediction</b></i> and <i><b>explanation</b></i> to reach our ultimate goal of understanding behavior. Is a prediction system enough? No, we must know how the black box functions by studying “latent processes” such as representation and computation. But what if we're wrong about representations, I thought? The view of <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists" target="_blank">@PsychScientists</a> immediately came to mind. Sorry to interrupt Dr. Hartley, but here's Golonka and Wilson in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/058925v3" target="_blank">Ecological Representations</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mainstream cognitive science and neuroscience both rely heavily on the notion of representation in order to explain the full range of our behavioral repertoire. The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties ... While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work</b></span>. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called 'representation-hungry' problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.</blockquote><br />They go on to invoke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology#Gibson" target="_blank">James J Gibson's</a> ecological information functions. But I can already hear Dr. Poeppel's colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/GregoryHickok">@GregoryHickok</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/568899227822252033" target="_blank">others on Twitter</a> debating with <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/733190148930850816" target="_blank">@PsychScientists</a>. Oh. Wait. Debate.<br /><br />Returning to <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience/" target="_blank">The Conversation</a> that I so rudely interrupted, Dr. Hartley gave some excellent examples of theories that link psychology and neuroscience. The <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/eye/trichrom.htm" target="_blank">trichromatic theory of color vision</a> — the finding that three independent channels convey color information — was based on psychophysics in the early-mid 1800s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory" target="_blank">Young–Helmholtz theory</a>). This was over a century before the discovery of cones in the retina, which are sensitive to three different wavelengths. She also mentioned the more frequently used examples of <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Tolman/Maps/maps" target="_blank">Tolman's cognitive maps</a> (which predated <i><a href="http://www.cognitivemap.net/" target="_blank" title="by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel">The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map</a></i> by 30 years) and error-driven reinforcement learning (Bush–Mosteller [<a class="xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip" data-hasqtip="6" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-23" id="xref-ref-23-2">23</a>, <a class="xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip" data-hasqtip="7" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-24" id="xref-ref-24-2">24</a>] and Rescorla–Wagner, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647" target="_blank">both of which predate</a> knowledge of dopamine neurons). To generate good linking hypotheses in the present, we need to construct formal models that make quantitative predictions (<i><b>generative models</b></i>).<br /><br /><b>(4) <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/sharon-thompson-schill" target="_blank">Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill</a></b> gave a brief introduction with no slides, which is good because this post has gotten very long. For this reason, I won't cover the panel discussion and the Q&amp;A period, which continued the same themes outlined above and expanded on “predictivism” (<i><b>predictive chauvinism</b></i> and data-driven neuroscience) and raised new points like the value (or not) of introspection in science. When the Cognitive Neuroscience Society updates their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg/videos">YouTube channel</a>, I'll let you know. Another source is the excellent live tweeting of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2019&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">@VukovicNikola</a>. But to wrap up, Dr. Thompson-Schill asked members of the audience whether they consider themselves psychologists or neuroscientists. Most identified as neuroscientists (which is a relative term, I think). Although more people will talk to you on a plane if you say you're a psychologist, “neuroscience is easy, psychology is hard,” a surprising take-home message.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Debating Debates</b></u><br /><br />I've actually wanted to see more debating at the CNS meeting. For instance, the <a href="https://www.neurolang.org/" target="_blank">Society for the Neurobiology of Language</a> (SNL) often features a lively debate at their conferences.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3</sup></b></span> Several examples are listed below.<br /><br /><b>2016:</b><br /><a href="https://www.neurolang.org/2017/debate-2016/" target="_blank">Debate: The Consequences of Bilingualism for Cognitive and Neural Function</a><br />Ellen Bialystok &amp; Manuel Carreiras <br /><br /><b>2014:</b><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116173834/http://www.neurolang.org/panelist-2014/">What counts as neurobiology of language – a debate</a> <br />Steve Small, Angela Friederici<br /><br /><b>2013: </b>Panel Discussions<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235112/http://www.neurolang.org/thursday-discussion-panel/" target="_blank">The role of semantic information in reading aloud</a><br />Max Coltheart vs Mark Seidenberg <br /><br /><b>2012:</b> Panel Discussions<br /><a href="https://www.neurolang.org/2017/2012-sessions-events/" target="_blank">What is the role of the insula in speech and language?</a><br />Nina F.

On one side is Nancy Kanwisher of MIT, who first proposed that the fusiform gyrus was specifically designed to recognize faces–and faces alone–based on her findings using a magnetic resonance imaging device. Then, Isabel Gauthier, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt, talked about her research, showing that the fusiform gyrus lights up when looking at many different kinds of objects people are skilled at recognizing.</blockquote>Kudos to <a href="https://www.newsday.com/" target="_blank"><i>Newsday</i></a> for keeping this article on their site after all these years.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> This is the color-word Stroop task: name the font color, rather than read the word.  <span><span style="color: red;"><b>BLUE</b></span></span> elicits conflict between the overlearned response ("read the word <i>blue</i>") and the task requirment (say "<i>red</i>").<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 2</sup></b></span> aka the  the now-obligatory David Poeppel session on BIG STUFF.

All PO generations, change orders, payments, and invoicing will be streamlined and automated via the Science Exchange platform and with the client’s existing approval workflows in place. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SSO integration with Science Exchange allows researchers to seamlessly access their Science Exchange account and offers all of the benefits of SSO on productivity, strong password security, and quick adoption of new company adopted tools. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers currently need to manage a separate process: set up folders with each new project, give access to external vendors, and manage keeping files up to date. File storage integration with Science Exchange removes this process and automatically copies all files uploaded to a Science Exchange order to a cloud file storage location of the client’s choosing. This allows researchers to eliminate a manual process and ensures that external project files are maintained in a compliant manner.</span></p></div>

The paper, “Risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma after antireflux surgery in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease in the Nordic countries,” purported to find that … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/03/29/scientific-integrity-a-rare-commodity-these-days-cancer-journal-makes-its-first-retraction/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Scientific integrity “a rare commodity these days:” Cancer journal makes its first retraction</span></a>

<p>The age of social media has opened up exciting opportunities for researchers to investigate people’s emotional states on a massive scale. For example, one study found that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1878">tweets contain more positive emotional words in the morning</a>, which was interpreted as showing that most people are in a better mood at that time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The premise of this line of research is that our word choices reflect our psychological states – that if someone uses more positive or negative emotional words, this is a good indication that they are actually experiencing those emotions. But now a new study has thrown a spanner in the works, finding that – for spoken language at least – this assumption might not hold up. In their <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8fpjn/">preprint posted recently on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>, Jessie Sun and colleagues found that emotion-related words do not in fact provide a good indication of a person’s mood, although there may be other sets of words that do.</p>
<p><span id="more-36796"></span></p>
<p>Sun’s team asked 185 American university students to wear a recording device for a week, which recorded a 30 second snippet of sound every 9.5 minutes. Four times per day, the participants also completed a survey via text message measuring the positive and negative emotions they had experienced over the previous hour.</p>
<p>The team ended up with a whopping 150,000 recordings, which research assistants transcribed over the course of two years, weeding out clips which contained no speech or just a few words. They then scored each recording according to how many positive and negative emotion words it contained (like “sweet” or “hurt”), by running the text through an analysis programme called the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count , which contains dictionaries of words associated with different topics. Finally, the team averaged the scores for all clips from the same three-hour period surrounding each questionnaire, ending up with 1,579 language-based emotion measurements that they could directly compare to participants’ self-reported mood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that – contrary to the assumptions of some past studies – the number of positive and negative emotional words was not associated with participants’ actual mood. “Our findings suggest that researchers should not assume that fluctuations in … [the use of emotional words] … can be used as a proxy for subjective emotion experience, at least for spoken language”, the authors write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But the recordings did contain some emotional information: the research assistants’ assessment of the speaker’s emotions, based on listening to the recordings, <i>was</i> associated with participants’ rating of their own mood. The authors suggest that the human raters were picking up on non-verbal cues relating to emotion – things like intonation and volume – that the programme itself was missing.</p>
<p>In an exploratory analysis, the authors also examined whether any other sets of words unrelated to emotion could predict participants’ mood. They found that greater use of words related to socialising, like “you” or “we”, was associated with experiencing more positive emotion, while use of maths words, like “minus” and “number”, was related to less positive emotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, these associations were weak, so may not be useful measures of emotion, say the authors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are other possible explanations for the null results in the study, which the authors acknowledge. It could be that a person’s use of emotion-related words taps into an aspect of emotion that also isn’t captured by self-report questionnaires<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– perhaps one that participants themselves aren’t consciously aware of. Alternatively, the dictionaries themselves may not always reflect how people use words: for example, the word “pretty” appears in the positive dictionary, but could be used in a negative context (e.g. “it was pretty terrible”). But even taking into account these limitations, the new study demonstrates the importance of checking the validity of tools in psychology research, to make sure that they are actually measuring what we think they are measuring. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Science Exchange’s shortlisted award submission was based on a case study in which FORMA Therapeutics, the integrated drug development and discovery company, used the Science Exchange platform to manage R&amp;D services spend, achieving time and cost savings. The FORMA team routed ~80% of their R&amp;D services spend onto the Science Exchange platform, eliminating administrative burdens and increasing the ROI of their external R&amp;D programs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud that the work we are doing with our clients to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs has been recognized by Procurement Leaders, for the third consecutive year,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder of Science Exchange. “Accessing external innovation has become a growing component of our clients’ R&amp;D strategies; however, administrative burdens can prevent R&amp;D teams from implementing best practices. Our solution lifts these burdens by providing a fully integrated R&amp;D services management solution across the enterprise.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winners of the awards will be announced on May 16, 2019 at the World Procurement Awards Ceremony in London, England.

<p>Think about the concepts of “red” and “justice” and you’ll notice a key difference. If you’re sighted, you’ll associate “red” most strongly with the sensory experience, which relates to signals from cone cells in your eyes. “Justice”, in contrast, doesn’t have any associated sensory qualities – as an abstract concept, you’ll think about its meaning, which you learnt via language, understanding it to be related to other abstract concepts like “fairness” or “accountability”, perhaps. But what about blind people – how do they think about “red”?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07574-3">A brain-imaging study</a> of 12 people who had been blind from birth, and 14 sighted people, published recently in <i>Nature Communications</i>, shows that while for sighted people, sensory and abstract concepts like “red” and “justice” are represented in different brain regions, for blind people, they’re represented in the same “abstract concept” region.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36784"></span></p>
<p>“You could be talking to a blind person, and if you didn’t know they were blind, you would never suspect that their experience of red is different from yours, because in fact they do know what red means,” argues Alfonso Caramazza at Harvard University, US, senior author on the paper. “They know what it means in the same way that you know what justice means.” That is, by hearing and reading about “red”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This idea, that for blind people colour concepts are treated more like abstract concepts, was backed up by the new findings. Lead author Ella Striem-Amit at Harvard University, together with Caramazza and other colleagues, used fMRI to look at their participants’ brain activity while they listened to words pertaining to different types of concept: concrete concepts that are familiar to both sighted and blind people, and which can be perceived in some way by both groups (like “cup”); visual concepts that are imperceptible only to blind people, such as “red” and “rainbow”; and abstract concepts without any sensory features, such as “freedom” and “justice”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results suggest that, for all of us, the medial anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is the brain area most responsible for the representation of concrete concepts with any kind of sensory perceptibility, while abstract concepts that are understood based on the meaning of the word, and which have no associated sensory information, are processed by the dorsolateral ATL. This led to a group difference for colour words, which were associated with increased activity in the anterior ATL in sighted participants, and increased activity in the dorsolateral ATL in the blind participants. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Though blind people lack the sensory experience of colour, they can nonetheless – thanks to language – form rich and accurate colour concepts, Caramazza notes. Not only do they learn that it’s a property of objects or scenes that’s unlike other sensory properties that they experience, but they can learn about differences between colours. Earlier work has shown, for example, that they know that orange is more similar to yellow and red than to green or blue, Caramazza says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Studies of colour knowledge in blind individuals have confirmed this aspect of their understanding of colour terms. However, our study has shown that this type of colour knowledge is represented in a region of the brain that is typically associated with knowledge of words that do not have sensory referents, like justice or virtue,” he says. “This reflects the important role of this region in acquiring meaning through language.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Fotolia_61915592_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Do you drink one small glass of wine a day? Maybe you even have one day off a week? That’s just under the UK low risk drinking guidelines of 14 units a week. You know cigarettes increase your risk of cancer but what about a glass of wine each night? Isn’t that supposed to be good for you?</p>
<blockquote><p>Survey data suggests only 13% of people are aware of a link between alcohol and cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, unfortunately while moderate drinking is considerably less dangerous than heavy drinking it is certainly not without its risks, particularly for women. Alcohol causes at least <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/does-alcohol-cause-cancer">seven types of cancer</a> (breast, liver, gullet, mouth, throat and bowel), and while the risk increases the more you drink, all levels of consumption carry a cancer risk. Furthermore, there is now <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext">robust evidence</a> that low levels of alcohol do not provide any protective health benefits.</p>
<p>The cancer risk associated with alcohol is worse for women because for moderate levels of consumption, for example one bottle of wine per week, the alcohol-associated cancer risk is higher for breast cancer than other cancers related to drinking. Breast cancer is now the leading cause of cancer in women, 1 in 7 UK women will be diagnosed within their lifetime and 1 in 13 cases can be linked to alcohol. You would not be alone if this was news to you. <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3855-6">Survey data</a> suggests only 13% of people are aware of a link between alcohol and cancer.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks need to be better communicated</strong></h3>
<p>Several large studies have described the links between moderate levels of alcohol and breast cancer. The first was published over 15 years ago. Public Health England have <a href="https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/press/women-encouraged-to-have-more-drink-free-days-to-reduce-their-risk-of-developing-breast-cancer/">released statements</a> encouraging women to have more alcohol-free days to reduce their cancer risk and <a href="http://www.reducemyrisk.tv">local awareness campaigns</a> are running. However these are failing to address long held beliefs that moderate drinking is beneficial, and many people simply think cancer is caused by ‘something else’. This issue is <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6701145/Deadly-link-alcohol-breast-cancer-ignored-middle-aged-women.html">not limited to the UK</a>.</p>
<p>On a daily basis women are exposed to alcohol advertising which is self-regulated and uses images which link alcohol with glamour, celebrity, having large groups of friends and starting new relationships. Drinks companies can advertise on TV, at the cinema, on social media, in magazines and newspapers and sponsor most high-profile sporting events. Previous <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/51/6/747/2374095">research</a> suggests that this is effective. The annual global marketing spend for the drinks industry is estimated at 1 trillion US dollars. Alcohol promotion helps establish alcohol as a normal commodity <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.13591">among consumers from an early age</a> and ensures drinking remains firmly entrenched in the British culture, rather than being understood to be a Class 1 carcinogen.</p>
<p>Compare this to smoking. Over 70% of the population understand smoking to be a major cause of cancer. Heavy taxes, advertising bans, plain packaging containing explicit health warnings, and a ban on smoking in public places has led to a decrease in smoking levels from <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-smoking/statistics-on-smoking-england-2016">46% of the UK population (1974) to 19% (2014)</a>. These are all tried and tested effective public health strategies aimed at informing the public and thereby reducing harmful behaviour. Smoking kills up to two thirds of its users, is the single largest preventable cause of cancer worldwide, and is responsible for 3 in 20 cases of cancer in the UK, but how does alcohol compare?</p>
<h3><strong>How many cigarettes in a bottle of wine?</strong></h3>
<p>Using information already published on alcohol and tobacco <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6576-9">we calculate</a> that on average for women, drinking 10 units of alcohol (about a bottle of wine) a week carries the equivalent cancer risk to 10 cigarettes. For men the figures are lower (10 units is equivalent to 5 cigarettes) but still substantial. This gender gap results from the fact that low levels of alcohol consumption increase the risk of breast cancer to a greater extent compared to the other alcohol-related cancers, and the increase in cancer risks due to smoking are slightly greater for men for most other cancers.</p>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-10936" height="418" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/wine-cigarettes-300x228.png" width="550" />
<p>This study by no means detracts from the substantive risks of smoking, but simply uses well established public knowledge on smoking and cancer to try to improve understanding of the cancer risks associated with alcohol. It is not a comparison of the overall disease burden of smoking versus drinking.</p>
<p>While tobacco-related cancer messages are typically supported by the media, the links between moderate alcohol consumption and cancer have been less well communicated. Often the only messages people routinely hear about alcohol are the ones promoted by the drinks industry.</p>
<p>We hope our simple message expressing alcohol-related cancer risks in terms of cigarettes will help tackle the lack of public awareness of the relationship between alcohol and cancer, and better inform people to make judgments about the risks they wish to take with their own health.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/newly-discovered-role-for-climbing-fibers-conveying-a-sensory-snapshot-to-the-cerebellum/">Newly Discovered Role for Climbing Fibers: Conveying a Sensory Snapshot to the Cerebellum</a></h4>

<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum</h4>
<p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in a better way.</p>
<p>Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right" id="attachment_5698" style="width: 310px;"><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5698" height="350" src="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Sensory enhancement is encoded in the presynaptic activity level of Climbing Fibers.</strong> Comparison of the sensory enhancement of calcium event amplitudes in Climbing Fibers compared to observations in Purkinje cells, measured in separate experiments. The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.</p></div>
<p>“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”</p>
<p>To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.</p>
<p>“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.</p>
<p>Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.</p>
<p>“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing fiber is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “</p>
<p>“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”</p>

<p>Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.</p>
<h4>Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?</h4>
<p>I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.</p>
<h4>How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?</h4>
<p>Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.</p>
<h4>What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?</h4>
<p>My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?</h4>
<p>I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>Psychology’s replication crisis receives a lot of airtime, with plenty of examples of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/">failed replications</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/18/widely-used-neuroimaging-analyses-allow-almost-any-result-to-be-presented-as-a-successful-replication-paper-claims/">methodological issues</a> that cast doubt on past research findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But there is also good news: several key results in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/">cognitive psychology</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/06/theres-another-area-of-psychology-where-most-of-the-results-do-replicate-personality-research/">personality research</a>, for example, have been successfully replicated.</p>
<p>Now researchers have reproduced the results of another highly-cited study. Back in 2002, Emily Pronin and colleagues first described the “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202286008">bias blind spot</a>”, the finding that people believe they are less biased in their judgments and behaviour than the general population – that is, they are “blind” to their own cognitive biases. And while that study kick-started a whole line of related research, no one had attempted to directly replicate the original experiments.</p>
<p>But in a preregistered preprint <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331431431_Agency_and_self-other_asymmetries_in_perceived_bias_and_shortcomings_Replications_of_the_Bias_Blind_Spot_and_extensions_linking_to_free_will_beliefs">published recently to ResearchGate</a>, Prasad Chandrashekar, Siu Kit Yeung and colleagues report reproducing the original study, first in a small group of Hong Kong undergraduates, and then in two larger samples of 303 and 621 Americans who completed online surveys.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36768"></span></p>
<p>Each group was given detailed descriptions of eight cognitive biases such as “hostile media bias” (where people view neutral media reports as hostile towards their own point of view) and “self-serving bias” (where people take responsibility for their successes but not failures). They were also given descriptions of three visible “personal shortcomings”, like procrastination and fear of public speaking.</p>
<p>The participants rated the extent to which they thought they exhibited these biases and shortcomings, before rating how much other people generally show these tendencies. Consistent with Pronin’s original result, across all three studies participants thought that their own susceptibility to biases was lower than that of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When it came to rating personal shortcomings, the results diverged from the original study. While Pronin had found no difference in how people rated their own and others’ shortcomings, the new research found that participants rated their own shortcomings as less severe. However, this difference was small, suggesting that people are more “blind” to their cognitive biases – which remain invisible – than to personal weaknesses which may have much more obvious effects (e.g. being late to hand in an assignment due to procrastination).</p>
<p>Chandrashekar’s team also added a new spin to the original study by investigating whether participants’ blind spot bias was influenced by their belief in free will (rated by their agreement with statements like “I am in change of the decisions I make”), which is known to affect how people judge themselves and others.</p>
<p>Participants with a stronger belief in free will had a greater blind spot when it came to personal shortcomings. That is, the gap between how they rated their own and others’ shortcomings was larger than the gap for people with a weaker belief in free will. The authors suggest that this is because people who believe more strongly that someone’s behaviours and decisions are completely under their own control are less likely to see such shortcomings in themselves: for them, such an admission would imply they have some innate weakness that can’t be overcome through their own choices. Belief in free will did not have any effect on the blind spot for cognitive biases, however.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors write that their results “provide reasonable support” for the findings of the original study, suggesting that the bias blind spot is a robust phenomenon. But it’s perhaps surprising that it is reportedly the first direct replication of a piece of research that is more than 15 years old and has received nearly 1,000 citations. Hopefully, the new effort is a sign that the field is increasingly recognising the value in well-designed replication attempts – something the authors themselves acknowledge. “The study contributes to the recent call for systematic, large-scale, and preregistered replication and validation studies,” they write.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/26/the-promise-and-efficiency-of-computational-psychiatry/">The promise and efficiency of Computational Psychiatry</a></h4>

<p>Often times in academia, there is a tendency to branch out on more and more tangents. This can be a good thing, in terms of intellectual freedom, boundless creativity, fresh material for the continual grant application. However, it also seems to be a way of escaping accountability, of rendering academic research one giant project in busywork.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of research if not to apply it (eventually)? Sometimes it is just fun to be curious and learn something that may someday be useful or is perhaps just interesting or fun to observe. But there are also many fields in which aimlessness is celebrated or encouraged. That is one of the beautiful parts of science, which can also allow for exciting discoveries to be made that later turn out to have highly significant effects. There are also fields in which abstraction or unapplicable revelations can stand on their own and are celebrated or mined for value: mathematics, philosophy, other arts and humanities are just as capable of producing this type of academic output.</p>
<p>If we get rather granular about the output of our field of research, the beauty and futility of it can become apparent and even coexist together. I had such an experience while working on my PhD project, a detailed computer model of a small part of the brain involved with memory. I wanted to base my model on the biology of the network as best I could. There were quite a few articles already published by anatomists, detailing the intricate studies done to count the numbers and types of neurons (brain cells) in that part of the brain. Those same scientists had also done meticulous work dying brain cells and characterizing their exact shape, size, and numbers of contacts with nearby cells. After sorting through all this published experimental data, which had taken years and years of work by dozens or hundreds of (mostly Hungarian) anatomists, I had a thought: what are we actually doing with this data? I wanted to use it to build a biologically realistic computer model, but might someone else want to use the data as well?</p>
<p>And if someone else wanted the data too, might it be worthwhile to somehow collate the data into a usable format that incorporates as much similar data as possible into a single product that can be used for reference?</p>
<p>I ended up doing just that, in a project that I now refer to as the <a href="https://www.sporadicsynapse.com/scientific-projects/quantitative-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative assessment</a>. This project then was able to form the basis for my larger research product, the detailed model and its resulting simulations. However, I also like the quantitative assessment on its own. I like how it makes use of the published literature, how it highlights and makes accessible a large body of mildly neglected facts that were gathered over years and years.</p>
<p>Much of the work in the published literature seems to lie around untouched, gathering dust, so I am always excited to hear about applications, databases, large review-type projects, and other methods to integrate or apply published data. Without such initiatives, we risk turning academia and especially science into a closed-loop system that is inaccessible to the broader public and to human-relevant progress and clinical applications.</p>
<p>With those concerns in mind, I was excited to stumble across a relatively new initiative by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that seeks to make use of the large body of published literature in the service of human health. The NIH’s <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dtr/adult-psychopathology-and-psychosocial-interventions-research-branch/computational-psychiatry-program.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computational Psychiatry</a> research funding initiative respects the significant amount of data available about psychiatric conditions and treatments, and it encourages scientists to apply algorithms to those information resources to multiple or exponentially increase their diagnostic and clinical value. It’s an example of a novel emphasis on existing literature that has a direct benefit to humankind in a relatively short time frame. In short, it’s an effective way of capitalizing on a large body of work already done, a smaller extra investment of time that can amplify the impact of the time already spent building the literature foundation for psychiatric conditions and treatments.</p>
<p>Our understanding of psychiatric conditions has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/preventing-mental-illness.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more sophisticated</a> and respectful of the whole person, with the advent of concepts such as formulation (instead of diagnosis) and the greater appreciation for contribution of a person’s life experience to the state of their brain and mind. The new emphasis on computational psychiatry complements this growing interest while also harnessing the power of our expanding computational infrastructure.</p>

<p>Having more testosterone makes men more aggressive – right? It’s a popular lay belief that’s supported by animal studies, but there’s been very little relevant research in humans. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619826970">study</a>, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, reveals a more nuanced picture: some men are more affected by raised levels of testosterone than others.</p>
<p><span id="more-36761"></span></p>
<p>Shawn Geniole at Nipissing University in Canada and colleagues studied 308 men aged 18 to 40. After completing a personality questionnaire, the participants gave a saliva sample, so their baseline testosterone level could be measured, and also a mouthwash sample, for DNA extraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants were told they would soon be paired with a partner for an online “decision making game”. But first they received a nasal gel, which was either a placebo or contained 11 mg of testosterone, and then they were videoed answering general personal questions, which they were told would be shown to their “partner” who was currently located in another room. To add even more realism to this cover story, the men then watched a video of their partner being interviewed in the same way (actually a researcher who provided scripted answers to the questions). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next came the “decision-making game”, which the men started half an hour after receiving the gel, and which was actually the well-validated “point-subtraction aggression paradigm”, which measures aggressive behaviour in response to provocations. (Points can be stolen from the other player, with no benefit to the participant themselves other than the satisfaction of penalising their partner; the number of points stolen is taken as a measure of behavioural aggression.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After this, the participants completed a questionnaire that asked about their impressions of the game and the other player. It asked, for example, “Did it make you feel good when you stole points from your game partner?” And “To what extent did you become angry when your game partner stole points from you?”</p>
<p>Earlier studies have suggested that testosterone has bigger effects on aggression among men who rank high on a personality measure of dominance. In this study, the researchers considered men who scored higher for dominance, higher for “independent self-construal” (which involves defining yourself in terms of internal attributes, such as traits, rather than in terms of relationships with others), and lower for self-control, as having high “personality risk” for the dose of testosterone making them more aggressive – and this is what they found</p>
<p>However, this personality effect was even stronger for the more than 200 men in the sample whose DNA analysis showed that they have a variation of the androgen receptor gene (that codes for the receptor that testosterone binds to) that makes the receptor more efficient. This “provides the clearest, albeit correlational, evidence to date that testosterone’s effects on human aggression are likely AR [androgen receptor] dependent,” the researchers write. They added that this is the first time that such fast-acting effects of testosterone on human social behaviour have been observed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Further analysis revealed that for the men with the more efficient androgen receptor, testosterone didn’t enhance the anger that they felt in response to being provoked — but it did boost the pleasure they derived from being aggressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This suggests that the dopaminergic system is involved in testosterone-promoted aggression. The high-risk personality traits noted in this study have also previously been linked to increased reward-related dopaminergic function, the researchers note. “If dopamine-mediated, testosterone may more strongly promote aggression among individuals with this personality profile because the profile may be indicative of an underlying hypersensitive dopaminergic system,” Geniole and his colleagues write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some caveats in relation to the work. One, of course, is that it shows correlations between personality and the androgen receptor gene on the one hand and testosterone-linked increases in aggression on the other,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than demonstrating causal relationships between these factors. It also doesn’t look at the effects of testosterone on aggression levels in individual men, but rather across the experimental groups. As the researchers note, further work will be needed to rule out other explanations for their findings. It will also need to look at groups other than white men, who were used in this study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, potentially there could be significant real-world implications. For example: “It will also be important to determine whether these interactive personality-risk effects extends to more chronic doses of testosterone, such as those used in the treatment of hypogonadism [testosterone deficiency],” the researchers note. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Discussions between patients and clinicians to decide on goals of care can lead to fewer unwanted interventions, better patient outcomes, and lower costs, but few clinicians initiate or encourage these discussions.</p>
<p>The barriers that prevent clinicians from having goals of care discussions have not been studied, so the authors of this paper conducted a survey among physicians and nurses at one hospital. The survey asked oncology clinicians to rate the importance of possible barriers to goals of care discussions. Barriers related to the patient and their family, such as the patient (or a family member) not accepting a poor prognosis or lack of patient capacity to make decisions, rated as the highest barriers. Among other categories of barriers, lack of time also received a high rating.</p>
<p>The importance of the identified barriers highlights the need for specialized training for oncology clinicians to have goals of care discussions with patients who may need support to make decisions throughout the course of illness.</p>

The lifestyle habits that affect the later development of these diseases are formed in early adulthood. A focus on prevention is needed in this population, but few studies have examined the association of specific lifestyle habits and disease risk factors in young adults.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper on Swedish young adults, ages 18-26, studied adherence to dietary recommendations and associations with metabolic risk markers such as insulin resistance and body fat. They found that more than half of the participants ate more sweets than recommended while approximately 85% ate less fruits and vegetables and 90% ate less whole grain or fish/seafood than recommended.</p>
<p>When they studied the association between meeting each dietary recommendation and specific risk markers, they found that eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower body fat in all participants. A similar association was seen in women eating the recommended amount of fish/seafood. They also saw lower insulin resistance in all participants meeting recommendations for fish/seafood, fruits and vegetables, and sweets. These results highlight the importance of helping young adults bring their dietary habits closer to recommendations in order to prevent diabetes and other diseases later in life.</p>

An analysis of salary disparities between health workers working in the Caribbean and popular destination countries</strong></a></h3>
<p>Shortages of health workers in high-income English-speaking countries such as the US, the UK, and Canada have led to recruitment of trained health workers from poorer countries, including in the Caribbean. Poor working conditions and the perception of better standards of living elsewhere have led to high migration of health workers from the Caribbean. For example, approximately half of all doctors trained in Jamaica since 1991 have migrated to find work elsewhere. Understanding in detail the financial incentive to migrate could help Caribbean governments design policies to retain health workers.</p>
<p>To build an accurate picture of the increased salaries of health workers in high-income countries, the authors of this study used purchasing power parity (PPP) to compare salaries for nurses, doctors and specialists in the US, the UK, and Canada to those in four Caribbean countries. PPP exchange rates provide a more realistic comparison of salaries between countries by equalizing the cost of living between those countries.</p>
<p>They found that salary gaps were lowest with the UK, ranging from 85% higher for nurses with little experience to 184% for doctors with over ten years experience, and highest with the US, ranging from 123% for doctors with little experience to over 500% for specialists. This evaluation highlighted the financial incentive for health workers to migrate, even those with little experience, draining the resources of Caribbean countries.</p>

<p>Hospital-acquired infections are a serious risk, especially for vulnerable patients. Medical staff need to be aware of the risk and know how to minimize them, but time for practical lessons is limited in nursing school curricula.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper sought to demonstrate the importance of hand hygiene to nursing students by adding two short practical sessions, totaling three hours, to a basic microbiology course at their institution. During the first session, the students touched bacterial culture plates to leave a sample of the bacteria normally found on their hands. In the second session, seven days later, the students examined the bacterial colonies that had grown on the culture plates, noting the number and characteristics of the bacterial colonies.</p>
<p>In order to measure the impact of this practical demonstration, the students were asked to fill out questionnaires before and after the pair of sessions testing their awareness of surfaces that could carry bacteria and actions that could facilitate infection. Awareness scores increased after the sessions, showing that a brief, simple addition to nursing school curricula could improve nursing students’ awareness of infection risk.</p>

Nerd Food: On Product Backlog<div id="content"><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%"><p class="verse" style="text-align: left;"><small>Would be be good to have a better bug-tracking setup? Yes. But I think it takes man-power, and it would take something *fundamentally* better than bugzilla. <i>-- <a href="http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/bug_tracking.html">Linus</a></i></small></p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Many developers in large companies tend to be exposed to a strange variation of agile which I like to call "Enterprise Grade Agile", but I've also heard it called "Fragile" and, most aptly, "Cargo-Cult Agile". However you decide to name the phenomena, the gist of it is that these setups contain nearly all of the ceremony of agile - including stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives and so on - but none of its spirit. Tweets such as this are great at capturing the essence of the problem: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Top tip: if you need to bring a notepad to the daily stand up to tell us what you did yesterday that's too many details</p>— Fran Buontempo (@fbuontempo) <a href="https://twitter.com/fbuontempo/status/686856528696086528">January 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  <p>Once you start having that nagging feeling of doing things "because you are told to", and once your stand-ups become more of a status report to the "project manager" and/or "delivery manager" - the existence of which, in itself, is rather worrying - your Cargo Cult Agile alarm bells should start ringing. As I see it, agile is a toolbox with a number of tools, and they only start to add value once you've adapted them to your personal circumstances. The fitness function that determines if a tool should be used is how much value it adds to all (or at least most) of its users. If it does not, the tool must be further adapted or removed altogether. And, crucially, you learn about agile tools by using them and by reflecting on the lessons learned. There is no other way. </p> <p>This post is one such exercise and the tool I'd like to reflect on is the <i>Product Backlog</i>. Now, before you read through the whole rant, its probably worth saying that this post takes a slightly narrow and somewhat "advanced" view of agile, with a target audience of those already using it. If you require a more introductory approach, you are probably better off looking at other online resources such as <a href="http://zerodollarbill.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-learn-scrum-in-10-minutes-and.html">How to learn Scrum in 10 minutes and clean your house in the process</a>. Having said that, I'll try to define terms best I can to make sure we are all on the same page. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Working Definition</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>Once your company has grokked the basics of agile and starts to move away from those lengthy specification documents - those that no one reads properly until implementation and those that never specified anything the customer wanted, but everything we thought the customer wanted and then some - you will start to use the product backlog in anger. And that's when you will realise that it is not quite as simple as memorising text books. </p> <p>So what do the "text books" say? Let's take a fairly typical definition - this one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements. Typically, a Scrum team and its product owner begin by writing down everything they can think of for agile backlog prioritization. This agile product backlog is almost always more than enough for a first sprint. The Scrum product backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote> <p>This is a good working definition, which will suffice for the purposes of this post. It is deceptively simple. However, as always, one must remember Yogi Berra: "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is." </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Potmenkin Product Backlogs</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>Many teams finish reading one such definition, find it amazingly inspiring, install the "agile plug-in" on their bug-tracking software of choice and then furiously start typing in those tickets. But if you look closely, you'd be hard-pressed to find any difference between the bug tickets of old versus the "stories" in the new and improved "product backlog" that apparently you are now using. </p> <p>This is a classic management disconnect, whereby a renaming exercise is applied and suddenly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village">Potemkin village-style</a>, we are now in with the kool kids and our company suddenly becomes a modern and desirable place to work. But much like Potemkin villages were not designed for real people to live in, so "Potmenkin Product Backlogs" are not designed to help you manage the lifecycle of a real product; they are there to give you the <i>appearance</i> of doing said management, for the purposes of reporting to the higher eschelons and so that you can tell stakeholders that "their story has been added to the product backlog for prioritisation". </p> <p>Alas, very soon you will find that the bulk of the "user stories" are nothing but glorified one-liners that no one seems to recall what exactly they're supposed to mean, and those few elaboratedly detailed tickets end up rotting because they keep being deprioritised and now describe a world long gone. Soon enough you will find that your sprint planning meetings will cover less and less of the product backlog - after all, who is able to prioritise this mess?  Some stories don't even make any sense! The final act is when all stories worked on are stories raised directly on the sprint backlog, and the product backlog is nothing but the dumping ground for the stories that didn't make it on a given sprint. At this stage, the product backlog is in such a terrible mess that no one looks at it, other than for the occasional historic search for valuable details on how a bug was fixed. Eventually the product backlog is zeroed - maybe a dozen or so of the most recent stories make it through the cull - and the entire process begins anew. Alas, enlightenment is never achieved, so you are condemned to repeat this cycle for all eternity. </p> <p>As expected, the Potmenkin Product Backlog adds very little value - in fact it can be argued that it detracts value - but it must be kept because "agile requires a product backlog". </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Bug-Trackers: Lessons From History</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In order to understand the difficulties with a product backlog, we turn next to their logical predecessors: bug-tracking systems such as <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. This post starts with a quote from the kernel's Benevolent Dictator that illustrates the problem with these. Linus has long taken the approach that there is no need for a bug-tracker in kernel development, although he does not object if someone wants to use one for a subsystem. You may think this is a very primitive approach but in some ways it is also a <i>very</i> modern approach, very much in line with agile; if you have a bug-tracking system which is taking time away from developers without providing any value, you should <i>remove</i> the bug-tracking system. In kernel development, there simply is no space for ceremony - or, for that matter, for anything which slows things down<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2">2</a></sup>. </p> <p>All of which begs the question: what makes bug-tracking systems so useless? From experience, there are a few factors: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>they are a "fire and forget" capture system. Most users only care about entering new data, rather than worrying about the lifecycle of a ticket. Very few places have some kind of "ticket quality control" which ensures that the content of the ticket is vaguely sensible, and those who do suffer from another problem: </li><li>they require dedicated teams. By this I don't just mean running the bug-tracking software - which you will most likely have to do in a proprietary shop; I also mean the entire notion of Q&amp;A and Testing as separate from development, with reams of people dedicated to setting "environments" up (and keeping them up!), organising database restores and other such activities that are incompatible with current best practices of software development. </li><li>they are temples of ceremony: a glance at the myriad of fields you need to fill in - and the rules and permutations required to get them exactly right - should be sufficient to put off even the most ardent believer in process. Most developers end up memorising some safe incantation that allows them to get on with life, without understanding the majority of the data they are entering. </li><li>as the underlying product ages, you will be faced with <a href="http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices/letters/the-sad-graph-of-software-death">the sad graph of software death</a>. The main problem is that resources get taken away from systems as they get older, a phenomena that manifests itself as a growth in the delta between the number of open tickets against the number of closed tickets. This is actually a <i>really</i> useful metric but one that is often ignored.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. </li></ul> <p>And what of the newest iterations on this venerable concept such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>? Well, clearly they solve a number of the problems above - such as lowering the complexity and cost barriers - and certainly they do serve a very useful purpose: they allow the efficient management of user interactions. Every time I create an issue - such as this <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/852">one</a> - it never ceases to amaze me how easily the information flows within GitHub projects; one can initiate comms with the author(s) or other users with <i>zero setup</i> - something that previously required mailinglist membership, opening an account on a bug-tracker and so forth. We now take all of this for granted, of course, but it is important to bear in mind that many open source projects would probably not even have <i>any</i> form of user interaction support, were it not for GitHub. After all, most of them are a one-person shop with very little disposable time, and it makes no sense to spend part of that time maintaining infrastructure for the odd person or two who may drop by to chat. </p> <p>However, for all of its glory, it is also important to bear in mind that GitHub Issues is <b>not</b> a product backlog solution. What I mean by this is that the product backlog must be owned by the team that owns the product and, as we shall see, it must be carefully groomed if it is to be continually useful. This is at loggerheads with allowing free flow of information from users. Your Issues will eventually be filled up with user requests and questions which you may not want to address, or general discussions which may or may not have a story behind it. They are simply different tools for different jobs, albeit with an overlap in functionality. </p> <p>So, history tells us what does not work. But is the product backlog even worth all this hassle? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-4"><h2 id="sec-4">Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"><p>One of the great things about agile is how much it reflects on itself; a strange loop of sorts. Presentations such as Kevlin Henney's <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/architecture-uncertainty">The Architecture of Uncertainty</a> are part of this continual process of discovery and understanding, and provide great insights about the fundamental nature of the development process. The product backlog plays - or should play - a crucial role exactly because of this uncertain nature of software development. We can explain this by way of a device. </p> <p>Imagine that you start off by admitting that you know very little about what it is that you are intending to do and that the problem domain you are about to explore is vast and complex. In this scenario, the product backlog is the sum total of the knowledge gained whilst exploring this space that has yet not been transformed into source code. Think of it like the explorer's maps in the fifteen-hundreds. In those days, "users" knew that much of it was incorrect and a great part was sketchy and ill-defined, but it was all you had. Given that the odds of success were stacked against you, you'd hold that map pretty tightly while the storms were raging about you. Those that made it back would provide corrections and amendments and, over time, the maps eventually converged with the real geography. </p> <p>The product backlog does something similar, but of course, the space you are exploring does not have a fixed geometry or topography and your knowledge of the problem domain can actively <i>change</i> the domain itself too - an unavoidable consequence of dealing with pure thought stuff. But the general principle applies. Thus, in the same way <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">a code base is precious</a> because it embodies the sum total knowledge of a domain - heck, in many ways it <i>is</i> the sum total knowledge of a domain! - so the product backlog is precious because it captures all the known knowledge of these yet-to-be-explored areas. In this light, you can understand statements such as this: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When your product backlog is empty, your product is dead - <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">@KevlinHenney</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/agileotb?src=hash">#agileotb</a></p>— Marc Johnson (@marcjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcjohnson/status/507522331900915712">September 4, 2014</a></blockquote> <p>So, if the backlog is this important, how should one manage it? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-5"><h2 id="sec-5">Works For Me, Guv!</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"><p>Up to this point - whilst we were delving into the problem space - we have been dealing with a fairly general argument, likely applicable to many. Now, as we enter the solution space, I'm afraid I will have to move from the general to the particular and talk only about the specific circumstances of my one-man-project <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a>. You can find Dogen's product backlog <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org">here</a>. </p> <p>This may sound like a bit of a cop out, you may say, and not without reason: how on earth are you supposed to extrapolate conclusions from a one-person open source project to a team of N working on a commercial product? However, it is also important to take into account what I said at the start: agile is what you make of it. I personally think of it as a) the smallest amount of processes required to make your development process work smoothly and b) and the continual improvement of those processes. Thus, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions; all one can do is to look at others for ideas. So, lets look at my findings<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. </p> <p>The first and most important thing I did to help me manage my product backlog was to use a simple text file in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> notation. Clearly, this is not a setup that is workable for a development team much larger than a set of one, or one that doesn't use Emacs (or <a href="https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer">Vim</a>). But for my particular circumstances it has worked <i>wonders</i>: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>the product backlog is close to the code, so wherever you go, you take it with you. This means you can always search the product backlog and - most importantly - add to it <i>wherever</i> you are and <i>whenever</i> an idea happens to come by. I use this flexibility frequently. </li><li>the Org Mode interface makes it really easy to move stories up and down (order is taken to mean priority here) and to create "buckets" of stories according to whatever categorisation you decide to use, up to any level of nesting. At some point you end up converging to a reasonable level of nesting, of course. It is surprising how one can manage <b>very</b> large amounts of stories thanks to this flexible tree structure. </li><li>it's trivial to move stories in and out of a sprint, keeping track of all changes to a story - they are just text that can be copy and pasted and committed. </li><li>Org Mode provides a very capable <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html">tagging system</a>. I first started by overusing these, but when tagging got too fine grained it became unmaintainable. Now we use too few - just <code>epic</code> and <code>story</code> - so this will have to change again in the near future. For example, it should be trivial to add tags for different components in the system or to mark stories as bugs or features, etc. <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-searches.html#Tag-searches">Searching</a> then allows you to see a subset of the stories that match those labels. </li></ul> <p>A second decision which has proven to be a very good one has been to groom the product backlog <i>very often</i>. And by this I don't just mean a cursory look, but a deep inspection of <i>all</i> stories, fixing them where required. Again, the choice of format has proved very helpful: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>it is easy to mark all stories as "non-reviewed" or some other suitable tag in Org Mode, and then unmark them as one finishes the groom - thereby ensuring all stories get some attention. As the product backlog becomes larger, a full groom could take multiple sprints, but this is not an issue once you understand its value and the cost of having it rot. </li><li>because the product backlog is with the code, any downtime can be used for grooming; those idle weekends or that long wait at the airport are perfect candidates to get a few stories looked at. Time spent waiting for the build is also a good candidate. </li><li>you get an HTML representation of the Org Mode file for free in GitHub, meaning you can read your backlog from your phone. And with the new editing functionality, you can also edit stories too. </li></ul> <p>Thirdly, I decided to take a "multi-pass" approach at managing the story lifecycle. These are some of the key aspects of this lifecycle management: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>stories can only be captured if they are aligned with the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/vision.org">vision</a>. This filter saves me from adding all sorts of ideas which are just too "out of the left field" to be of practical use, but keeps <a href="https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#visionary">those that may sound crazy</a> are but aligned with the vision. </li><li>stories can only be captured if there is no "prior art". I always perform a number of searches in the backlog to look for anything which covers similar ground. If found, I append to that. </li><li>new stories tend to start with very little content - just the minimum required to allow resetting state back to the idea I was trying to capture. Due to this, very little gets lost. At this point, we have a "proto-story". </li><li>as time progresses, I end up having more ideas on this space, and I update the story with those ideas - mainly bullet points with one liners and links. </li><li>at some point the story begins to mature; there is enough on it that we can convert the "proto-story" to a full blown story. After a number of grooms, the story becomes fully formed and is then a candidate to be moved to a sprint backlog for implementation. It may stay in this state <i>ad-infinitum</i>, with periodic updates just to make sure it does not rot. </li><li>A candidate story can still get refined: trimmed in scope, re-targeted, or even cancelled because it no longer fits with the current architecture or even the vision. Cancelled stories are important because we may come back to them - its just very unlikely that we do. </li><li>every sprint has a "sprint mission"<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. When we start to move stories into the sprint backlog, we look for those which resonate with the sprint mission. Not all of them are fully formed, and the work on the sprint can entail the analysis required to create a full blown story. But many will be implementable directly off of the product backlog. </li><li>some times I end up finding related threads in multiple stories and decide to merge them. Merging of related stories is done by simply copying and pasting them into a single story; over time, with the multiple passes done in the grooms, we end up again with a single consistent story. </li></ul> <p>What all of this means is that a story can evolve over time in the product backlog, only to become the exact thing you need at a given sprint; at that point you benefit from the knowledge and insight gained over that long period of time. Some stories in Dogen's backlog have been there for years, and when I finally get to them, I find them extremely useful. Remember: they are a map to the unknown space you are exploring. </p> <p>With all of this machinery in place, we've ended up with a very useful product backlog for Dogen - one that certainly adds a lot of value. Don't take me wrong, the cost of maintenance is high and I'd rather be coding instead of maintaining the product backlog, especially given the limited resources. But I keep it because I can see on a daily basis how much it improves the overall quality of the development process. It is a price I find worth paying, given what I get in return. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-6"><h2 id="sec-6">Final Thoughts</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"><p>This post was an attempt to summarise some of the thoughts I've been having on the space of product backlogs.

<p>It is not too long ago that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/">mirror neurons</a> were touted as one of the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience (or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience">most hyped</a>, depending on your perspective). First discovered in monkeys, these brain cells fire when an individual performs a movement <em>or</em> when they see someone else perform that movement. This automatic neural mirroring of other’s actions was interpreted by some scientists as the seat of human empathy. The cells’ most high-profile champion, US neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, described them as “the neurons that shaped civilisation” and, in 2000, he (in)famously said they would do for psychology what DNA did for biology. Nearly 20 years on, what evidence do we have that mirror neurons provide the basis for human empathy? According to a new meta-analysis and systematic review <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6bu4p/">released as a preprint at <em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, the short answer is “not a lot”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36755"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Soukayna Bekkali and Peter Enticott at the University of Deakin, searched the literature for all English language studies conducted in humans that had investigated whether mirror neuron activity was correlated with empathy.</p>
<p>This search led to the identification of 52 relevant papers involving over 1000 participants. These studies had used a range of methods to measure mirror neuron activity (including fMRI brain scanning, EEG recording of brain activity and TMS –  magnetic stimulation typically applied to the motor cortex, to check how much it had already been activated by witnessing movement by others). There were also various measures of empathy: mostly self-report questionnaires, but also measures of “motor empathy” (the automatic mimicry of other people’s movements) and the recognition of other’s facial emotions.</p>
<p>There was a notable lack of objective measures of empathy, such as looking at participants’ heart rate or skin conductance (the involuntary production of sweat as part of an emotional response). Overall, participant samples were small and there was great inconsistency in methods.</p>
<p>Bekkali and her colleagues broke down the literature according to whether the papers had investigated motor empathy, emotional empathy (feeling what someone else is feeling), and/or cognitive empathy (knowing what someone else is feeling or thinking).</p>
<p>Regarding motor empathy, the accumulated evidence pointed to no association with mirror neuron activity. Regarding emotional empathy, there was no evidence for a link with mirror neuron activity in one key brain region where these cells are thought to reside (the inferior parietal lobule; IPL) and only weak evidence for an association with postulated mirror neuron activity in another key brain area, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). “It remains unclear how the mirror neuron system relates to the experience of emotional empathy,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of cognitive empathy, there was no evidence for a mirror neuron link in the IPL and weak evidence of a link with activity in the IFG. “The current results suggest mirror neuron activity may play a role in cognitive empathy,” the researchers said, adding that “the mirror neuron system may potentially be one neurophysiological mechanism subserving cognitive empathy.”</p>
<p>One problem with interpreting the existing evidence base is that the results tended to vary according to the methods used, not only in terms of how mirror neuron activity and empathy were measured, but also according to the stimuli presented to participants, such as whether they viewed real images of people performing actions, or cartoons, and whether the images were dynamic or static. There is no currently accepted “gold standard” measure of mirror neuron activity in humans, the review authors also noted, and some evidence of a file-drawer problem in the literature, in which positive results are more likely to be published.</p>
<p>Finally, although this thorough investigation of the existing evidence base uncovered some modest evidence that mirror neurons may be involved in empathy – especially cognitive empathy (or understanding other people’s perspectives) – to date there is no evidence that mirror neurons play a causal role in empathy or are necessary for empathy.</p>
<p>When excitement about mirror neurons was at its peak, it was common for newspaper columnists and media commentators to reference these cells with confidence when discussing empathy. “It’s thanks to these cells that we are willing to help strangers in need”; “the best rom coms trigger our mirror neurons”; “altruists have more mirror neurons”, and so on. We were getting ahead of ourselves. After more than two decades of research, this new review provides a sober reminder that our understanding of the neural basis of empathy, and especially the role played by mirror neurons, remains far from complete.</p>

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he presents results from his Ph.D. research on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that the brain retains its capacity to form and remove whole synapses in adulthood.
This type of plasticity, termed structural plasticity, is capable of altering connectivity, and therefore function, of neuronal networks of the brain over periods of days and months.
Although reports of disruptive effects of structural plasticity remain scarce, a number of lesion experiments have described the time course of synaptic structures during network reorganisation by homeostatic structural plasticity in great detail.
The underlying mechanisms that drive these changes, however, are yet to be explained.
To investigate the dynamics of synaptic structures reported in these lesion studies, we replicated a peripheral lesion in a biologically plausible spiking network model that exhibits cortical asynchronous irregular firing.
Here, we present results from our computational modelling study.</p>
<p>Results from our simulations suggest that for activity to be restored to deprived neurons in the lesion projection zone (LPZ), excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic structures must exhibit opposite activity dependent growth behaviours.
Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they contribute to the maintenance of optimal activity levels in individual neurons.
Where a reduction in neuronal activity results in the sprouting of new excitatory post-synaptic structures, it is accompanied by the retraction of their inhibitory counterparts.
Extra activity is similarly countered by a retraction of excitatory post-synaptic structures and sprouting of inhibitory ones.
Our simulations also reproduce the ingrowth of excitatory axons into, and the outgrowth of inhibitory axons out from the LPZ that have been observed in lesion experiments.
We find that the ingrowth of excitatory axons requires that sprouting of excitatory pre-synaptic structures be stimulated by extra excitatory neuron activity.
The outgrowth of inhibitory axons, on the other hand, necessitates the sprouting of inhibitory pre-synaptic structures to be prompted by a loss in inhibitory neuron activity.
In conclusion, by modelling repair following deafferentation that is faithful to experimental findings, we make testable predictions on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>

<p>Psychologists have devoted much time over the last two decades documenting <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/">the dark side of human nature</a> as encapsulated by the so-called Dark Triad of traits: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism. People who score highly in these traits, who break the normal social rules around modesty, fairness and consideration for others, seem to fascinate as much as they appall. But what about those individuals who are at the other extreme, who through their compassion and selflessness are exemplars of the best of human nature? There is no catchy name for their personality traits, and while researchers have studied altruism, forgiveness, gratitude and other jewels in our behavioural repertoire, the light side of human personality has arguably not benefited from the same level of attention consumed by the dark side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full">Writing in the journal <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, a team led by US psychologist and author Scott Barry Kaufman at Barnard College, Columbia University says it is high time we redressed this imbalance. “Too much focus on one aspect of human nature at the expense of the other misrepresents the full capacities of humanity,” they write. Through four studies featuring more than 1,500 online participants, Kaufman and his team have created a new questionnaire that taps what they are calling the Light Triad (see example items below, and you can take the test <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/">online</a>). They’ve also provided preliminary evidence for the kind of personal characteristics and psychological outcomes that are associated with being a high scorer on the light side of personality – or what they call an “everyday saint”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36727"></span></p>
<p>The research involved participants rating their agreement with statements designed to tap into the more positive, compassionate and selfless aspects of human personality. Kaufman’s team took inspiration for these items from surveys used to measure the Dark Triad, but they made sure that their new items were not simply the Dark Triad questionnaire items in reverse; they also sought advice from experts in positive psychology and personality psychology to help them with the compilation. Participants also completed established measures of the Dark Triad, of the Big Five personality traits, and various other measures of psychological outcomes, well-being, values and characteristics.</p>
<p>The new 12-item Light Triad scale that the researchers settled on after removing redundant items taps three light traits: <strong>Kantianism</strong> (“treating people as ends unto themselves, not as mere means to an end”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I don’t feel comfortable overtly manipulating people to do something I want”); <strong>Humanism</strong> (“valuing the dignity and worth of each individual”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I tend to treat others as valuable”); and <strong>Faith in Humanity</strong> (i.e. “believing in the fundamental goodness of humans”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I think people are mostly good”).</p>
<p>The participants’ scores on the Light Triad traits were negatively correlated with their scores on the Dark Triad traits, but only modestly, suggesting that each is not merely the mirror opposite of the other, and that we all have varying levels of both light and dark traits. On an uplifting note, Kaufman and his colleagues found that their participants’ scores were skewed more towards scoring higher on the Light Triad than the Dark (see below). “Extreme malevolence was rare in the samples we studied,” they write.</p>

<p>Overall, and consistent with past research, younger participants, men, those motivated by power, sex, and selfish ambitions, were more likely to score higher on the Dark Triad. In turn, high scorers on the Dark Triad also tended to score lower on life satisfaction, agreeableness, self-transcendent values, compassion, empathy and belief in the good of humanity. More advantageously (in certain contexts), higher scorers on the Dark Triad also reported more casual sexual partners, greater creativity, bravery, assertiveness and leadership.</p>
<p>On the other hand, older people, women, those with more stable childhoods, and the more religious and spiritual, tended to score higher on the Light Triad. In turn, scoring highly on the Light Triad was associated with various appealing and beneficial sequelae, such as higher life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, feelings of autonomy and competence, higher conscientiousness, compassion, empathy, openness, humility and belief in the goodness of others.</p>
<p>There were also some possible downsides of being too much of an “everyday saint”, such as having weaker motives for achievement and self-enhancement (potentially impeding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/23/have-you-got-a-self-actualised-personality-a-new-test-brings-maslows-ideas-into-the-21st-century/">the pursuit of self-actualisation</a>, or being the best version of oneself); a proclivity for interpersonal guilt; and excessive trust and compassion that could leave one open to exploitation. Overall, though, Kaufman and his colleagues said that scoring higher on the Light Triad than Dark is associated with a greater quality of life, and they added “we believe that Light Triad individuals are more enjoyable to be around and likely to exert a more positive net effect on the world.”</p>
<p>The researchers do stress that this is exploratory work. It involved participants from mostly the US and UK, and relied almost exclusively on people rating themselves. There was one exception – an economic game, in which higher Light Triad scorers were, unsurprisingly, more generous to others.</p>
<p>I also put it to lead author Scott Barry Kaufman that sceptics may accuse his team of falling for the “jangle fallacy” – that is, relabelling the existing, well-established psychological concepts of agreeableness (a Big Five trait) and humility and honesty (from the HEXACO model of personality). Kaufman said it’s fair to suggest that the Light Triad traits are facets of agreeableness, but he believes there is value in digging deeper into these facets or sub-traits, as well as finding ways to measure them, so as to better predict outcomes that would be missed by only measuring the main, overarching positive personality traits.</p>
<p>“What I believe the light triad captures, and is not fully represented by existing facets of agreeableness, is a fundamental humanistic worldview, which includes a belief in the fundamental goodness of humans, and the motivation to treat individuals as valuable and worthy, regardless of what they can provide for you personally,” Kaufman added. “We live in such a world where everyone thinks their own problems and causes are more important than everyone else’s central causes, and we have lost an appreciation for the fundamental dignity of each other, even if they have very different political beliefs or come from a very different culture. The light triad worldview is desperately needed in the world today.”</p>
<p>Given this need, as well as the positive characteristics and wellbeing measures that the new research suggests is associated with scoring highly on the Light Triad, I also asked Dr Kaufman if there is anything the less saintly among us can do, to try to drag our personality traits out of the shadows and into the light. “Interventions that shift perspective, and increase a sense of universal love and self-transcendence,” could have this effect, he said. “This could include engaging regularly in a loving-kindness meditation, using new virtual reality technologies to engage in self-transcendent experiences (see <a href="https://davidbryceyaden.com/publications/">David Yaden’s work</a>) – such as awe (e.g., viewing images that are beautiful or inspiring), and even intentionally engaging in the perspectives of others that are very different from ours with rational compassion (see <a href="https://minddevlab.yale.edu/publications">Paul Bloom’s work</a>), curiosity, and loving-kindness.”</p>
<p>Increasing <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/27/no-being-kind-to-yourself-does-not-make-you-weak-or-immodest/">self-compassion</a> could be another route to increase Light Triad traits, Kaufman added, considering the strong correlation he and his colleagues found “between thinking that one’s own self is good and thinking that others are basically good”.</p>
<p>Kaufman and his colleagues, David Yaden, Elizabeth Hyde and Eli Tsukayama, conclude their new paper by acknowledging that the Dark Triad traits are certainly worthy of study when you consider the harm, at an individual and societal level, that is caused by high scorers on these traits. “However,” they write, “we believe that the light side of personality is also worth understanding. We hope that the current investigation stimulates further research on the good that those with Light Triad characteristics create in the world.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/21/safe-spaces-versus-confronting-reality/">Safe spaces versus confronting reality</a></h4>

<p>One debate about college environments that keeps coming up is that of free speech versus safe spaces, how to balance the basic expectation of civility and respect that students have when they attend university  with the need to be pushed out of our safe spaces to produce the growth and education that universities are called to give students.</p>
<p>Not being a minority in any sense of the word, I’m not going to attempt to tackle in this post how we could balance our duty to provide underrepresented students the same level of stability and basic comfort and respect that the rest of us already expect when we move throughout our campus communities. But what I do want to talk about today is what we can do after someone’s comfort zone has been breached.</p>
<p>Because we know it’s going to happen. And it will happen for all of us at some point during our college careers, hopefully more than just once. Those times of discomfort are necessary for growth, if we know how to care for them and use them to our benefit when they arise. So, I think the focus of the discussion about safe spaces and triggers can be shifted slightly to make the discussion more fruitful.</p>
<p>What I would discuss instead is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we identify when someone is experiencing one of these, or recognize when we ourselves are in one of these events?</li>
<li>How can we turn one of these events into an opportunity for constructive growth, meaning furthering education about the world or acquiring greater self knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first goal involves being aware of the internal feelings and assumptions of ourselves and others. This means being able to tolerate, to some extent, the discomfort of bodily feelings. It also means being proficient at reading other people and having some knowledge of their goals, values, and assumptions prior to the event. It requires a certain level of confidence and a sense of self and knowledge of the ability to tolerate extreme and unanticipated stress.</p>
<p>The second goal requires a knowledge of the resources available to us and others. This may include counselors and other therapeutic healing practices, as well as various forms of communication.</p>
<p>We also need to determine what is an appropriate level of discomfort or trigger. This is where things get very controversial. In general, at the college level especially, there is no one appropriate level of intellectual offense beyond which a line has been crossed, as long as we’re discussing communicating ideas  via legal and appropriate means such as via text books, civil discussion and lectures, movies, homework and class projects.</p>
<p>The usefulness of a lesson is lost if it traumatizes the student. Responsible faculty would try to reduce this risk by avoiding lessons or modes of communication that they reasonably expect to be traumatic to their students.</p>
<p>But since we often don’t know the personal history, original culture, and life experiences of the people around us, we can’t be assured of whether something is experienced by them as traumatic or not. I had a horrible experience at a seminar in college where we watched a graphic movie. We had been told ahead of time that we would be watching a movie about a violent rape and double murder and that the movie would be exploring the theme of forgiveness in what seems like an impossible situation. The seminar was not required, but I went anyway because I have often wondered about the concept of forgiveness, something that I struggle with myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Anyway, we watched the movie, and it was way more traumatic than I expected. I couldn’t complain, because I found myself just being grateful that I wasn’t the person being depicted on screen. To me, the violence looked real. My physiological system couldn’t differentiate between seeing the event through the TV screen versus in real life, and it felt horrible to sit there watching people’s lives end brutally. It was so triggering for me that I couldn’t comprehend what the movie was trying to teach me about forgiveness. I didn’t get a debrief afterward either, so I was just haunted by what I had witnessed without any real growth from it. I also felt creeped out that no one around me seemed to be reacting as strongly as I was to seeing something so terrifying.</p>
<p>I reasoned that I shouldn’t complain about not being given sufficient warning before seeing something so horrible, because the people who it happened to in real life hadn’t been warned either. But the ostensible point of the film was not to traumatize its viewers. And the forum in which we were watching it was not supposed to do that either, it was supposed to get us thinking about the concept of forgiveness. I left the seminar in a state of mild shock and with no further understanding of forgiveness, such as the difference between transactional forgiveness and a state forgiveness. For me, that movie and that lesson failed.</p>
<p>And that is an example of a potential learning opportunity gone horribly wrong. Ideally, the seminar could have included a discussion of how we were feeling after having watched something so awful and an overview of the resources available to us to recover from it. We could have also had a meatier discussion about types and instances of forgiveness in our own lives or in the lives of famous historical figures, with several different viewpoints and situations being introduced to us to broaden our minds.</p>
<p>I eventually discovered or was introduced to the writings of folks such as Martin Luther King Jr, Thich Nhat Hanh, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and more. I learned about the shades of different emotions and spiritual states by reading Martha Nussbaum. But it took me years to do this, years during which I could have benefited from already having that spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these opportunities of difficulty and discomfort that faculty may seek out for their students and that students ideally learn to seek out for themselves are not in themselves wrong or politically distasteful. It is more that they are only responsible, they are only civil and respectful of people with diverse backgrounds and underrepresented students, if we make sure to debrief and heal anyone who has been traumatized afterward, and if we continue the discussion until we have heard and debated the diverse perspectives of the other participants. Notably, this means that we may need to iterate between healing and further discussions, because students who were traumatized by the original lecture or seminar content are not in a position to then continue the discussion. If we don’t allow for healing followed by further discussions, then the “learning experience” becomes just an excuse to further traumatize already disadvantaged members of the student population.</p>

<p>Smartphone addiction (SA) is a controversial concept that is not recognised by psychiatry as a formal diagnosis. Critics say that a problematic relationship with one’s phone is usually a symptom of deeper underlying issues and that it is inappropriate to apply the language of addiction to technology. Nonetheless, other mental health experts believe SA is real and they’ve accumulated evidence suggesting it is associated with reductions in academic and work performance, sleep disorders, <a href="http://www.neuroregulation.org/article/view/18189">symptoms of depression and loneliness</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">declines in wellbeing</a> – and an increased risk of road traffic accidents. According to a group of psychiatry and psychology researchers at one of the largest universities in Brazil, to that list can now be added: poorer decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Studies suggest that the numbers of people with notional SA (defined by difficulty in controlling use of the smartphone, constant <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/05/07/a-new-questionnaire-measures-peoples-no-mobile-phone-phobia-or-nomophobia/">preoccupation with the possibility of being without it</a>, and poor mood when it is taken away) are high – about 25 per cent of the population in the US; <a href="http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/28421/1/5974_Lopez-Fernandez.pdf">10 per cent of adolescents</a> in the UK; and a massive 43 per cent of people in Brazil, where the new research, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00073/full">published in <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i></a>, was conducted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36724"></span></p>
<p>Previous work has found that people with other forms of dependency, including drug and gambling addiction, show impaired decision-making in ambiguous situations, though not when the risks associated with making a decision are clearly outlined. Julia Machado Khoury at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and her colleagues, including lab head Frederico Duarte Garcia, wanted to know whether the same might be true for people with SA.</p>
<p>Using a Brazilian version of the Smartphone Addiction Inventory, which was created in 2014, the researchers identified 47 graduate students aged 18 to 25 who scored high enough to qualify as having an addiction (according to the developers of the Inventory). The researchers then compared these students’ performance with those of 43 matched controls on two widely-used decision-making tasks. In the Iowa Gambling Task, which is meant to simulate real-life decision-making, participants must make as much money as possible by selecting face-down cards from four different decks, with each card indicating whether they’ve earned or lost money. Two decks are more advantageous in the long term, but the participants have to work this out for themselves through trial and error. In contrast, the Game of Dice Task requires participants to make as much money as possible through a series of dice throws in which the rules and the probabilities of winning different amounts are stable and so predictable throughout.</p>
<p>The high scorers on notional smartphone addiction performed about the same as the controls on the Game of Dice task. But they were worse, on average, at the Iowa Gambling Task – and the greater the severity of their purported addiction, as indicated by their SA inventory results, the worse their performance. As the researchers note: “Decision-making under ambiguity reflects more strongly the reality of daily decisions, which are made without prior certainty of the probability of each outcome.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers monitored all the participants’ skin conductance data throughout, they could also look for changes in arousal, which they took to indicate responsiveness to perceived rewards or punishments. Compared with the controls, the high scorers on smartphone addiction showed lower skin conductance responsiveness before disadvantageous choices, higher responsiveness after rewards (winning) and lower responsiveness after punishments. This “suggests difficulty in recognising disadvantageous alternatives, high sensitivity to rewards and low sensitivity to punishments,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They argue that the decisions of those scoring high in smartphone addiction are guided more by the search for rewards than the avoidance of punishments. They add that this could help to maintain and even worsen their addiction, and contribute to sliding academic performance and deteriorating social relationships.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Machado Koury and her colleagues suspect that people with pre-existing tendencies to favour gaining rewards over avoiding punishments may be more likely to develop smartphone addiction, which could then make these tendencies worse. Sceptical readers will note that the new research provides no evidence for this worsening effect, and may wonder about the other underlying psychological differences between the groups that could account for the findings.</p>
<p>For their part, the researchers argue that not only does this study help to bolster the argument that SA is a genuine addiction (the “same disease with another face”), but that the findings also have some clinical implications: “preventative strategies can focus on the development of emotional regulation, awareness of bodily signs/symptoms and postponement of rewards.” There are already effective strategies for helping people with all these things, including physical exercise, focused attention training, mindfulness, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Arguably then, these strategies may help people with an unhealthy relationship with their smartphone, and even prevent it from becoming problematic, whether we call that an addiction or something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The 2008 Lancet paper of Paolo Macchiarini and Martin Birchall about the world first trachea transplant might end up retracted. Until recently, the journal's editor Richard Horton used to ignore and suppress "non peer-reviewed" evidence, but due to combined pressure of activism, media and politics, things started to move.

Scientific papers should have two Discussion sections - one written by the authors, and the other by an independent researcher.

According to a new paper from Michael S. Avidan, John P. A. Ioannidis and George A. Mashour, this "second discussant" system could help ensure more balanced and objective inference in science.



The authors begin by noting that while the reproducibility crisis has focussed attention on the Methods and Results sections of papers, Discussion sections are not free

<p>Edward Wakelam's journal club session, where he will present his work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student’s likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those at risk of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, though data mining and machine learning approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. Ed describes an experiment conducted on a final year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data is limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. Ed found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially at risk.</p>

<p>Millions of people around the world spend time and money on healthcare remedies that mainstream science considers ineffective (in the sense of being no more effective than a placebo), like homeopathy and acupuncture. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2018.1508685">study published recently in <i>Psychology and Health</i></a> investigated how to address this issue in the context of multivitamins, which evidence suggests provide no benefit for healthy people – and may even cause harm in some contexts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Despite this research evidence, huge numbers of healthy people take multivitamins because they appear to be helpful. Scientists refer to this as the “illusion of causality”: when someone takes a vitamin and then their cold goes away, for example, they may believe it was the vitamin that cured them, even though they would have recovered just as quickly anyway. Past research has shown that simply giving people the raw outcomes of clinical trials that show remedies to be ineffective does<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>not necessarily help combat this problem, perhaps because the data can involve large numbers and complex findings, which are difficult for the public to interpret.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Douglas MacFarlane and colleagues from the University of Western Australia have explored how to better inoculate people against this illusion. The researchers report that people need to be told clearly about the proportion of people who benefit from the remedy versus taking a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/11/the-placebo-effect-digested-10-amazing-findings/">placebo</a> – <i>and</i> this data has to be accompanied by a scientific explanation for why the remedy is ineffective.</p>
<p><span id="more-36712"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 245 undergrad participants and split them into several groups, which were each given different levels of information about the effectiveness of a multivitamin. At one extreme, a control group received no information about the number of people who benefited from the remedy, and was simply told that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against using it. At the other extreme, another group was told that 3 out of 4 people benefitted from the pills, but that 3 out of 4 people also benefitted from a placebo, so the evidence showed that the remedy doesn’t have any health benefit. This group was also given a scientific explanation for why this should be: healthy people already receive enough vitamins in their diet.</p>
<p>There were also various intermediate groups, such as one that received information about the proportion of people who get a benefit from the pills, but no information on the effects of placebo, and another that received information about the pills and placebo, but no scientific explanation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Afterwards, all participants were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a tube of the multivitamins. The only group who showed a reduced willingness to pay for the pills was the one given full information on the pills’ efficacy compared with a placebo <i>and</i> the scientific explanation of why they are not effective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results suggest that simplified frequencies showing how many people have and haven’t benefited from a remedy compared with placebo could help prevent the illusion of causality. This strategy could be used by health authorities to assist people making healthcare decisions, say the authors. At the moment, they write, bodies like the National Institutes of Health in the United States often frame disclaimers about ineffective remedies in diplomatic language about “insufficient clinical evidence”, rather than giving people this kind of simple, explicit data.</p>
<p>Importantly though, the new findings suggest these frequencies are only useful when given alongside a scientific explanation. “This component may serve to fill the mental gap created when a prior belief is challenged by scientific evidence,” write the authors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This conclusion comes with a hefty caveat, however. Because only one group was actually given the scientific explanation, it remains unclear based on the current results whether the explanation and the simple frequencies are <i>both</i> necessary. A scientific explanation about why a remedy is ineffective could, in theory, reduce a person’s willingness to pay regardless of how much they know about the underlying data. Of course, scientific explanations alone <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/">can be pretty unsuccessful at changing people’s minds</a>, so this possibility seems unlikely – but it would be nice to see this question incorporated into the design of a future study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
