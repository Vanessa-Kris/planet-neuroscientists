A paper just out in eccentric medical journal Medical Hypotheses caught my eye yesterday:



Potential role of calcifying nanoparticles in the etiology of multiple sclerosis



Hmm, I thought, this looks interesting. I'd never heard of the idea that nanoparticles could cause neurological illness.



So I read the paper and quickly found myself falling down a (nano)rabbithole into a fascinating and little-known tale of strange science.







It turns out that the 'calcifying nanoparticles' ment

<p>Quelle est la part de l’inné et de l’acquis dans l’intelligence, ou plus généralement dans les facultés cognitives ? C’est une question très controversée, en particulier parce qu’elle a une grande portée politique : l’éducation est-elle importante, ou bien tout est-il prédéterminé par nos gènes ? Il est évident que dans le second cas, investir dans l’éducation semble vain ; il devrait plutôt s’agir de faire de la sélection et de l’orientation que de l’éducation.</p>
<p>Il existe une littérature scientifique abondante sur ce sujet, malheureusement ses résultats sont souvent mal interprétés et déformés par des idéologues. Prenons l’exemple d’une <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/les-profs-tombent-dans-le-piege-de-l-adn_2083387.html">récente tribune</a> de l’essayiste Laurent Alexandre dans l’Express :</p>
<p><em>« 64% de nos différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques ; l’école et la famille n’ont malheureusement qu’un rôle marginal face à nos chromosomes ».</em></p>
<p>Je vais supposer que la première assertion est correcte et bien établie scientifiquement. La conclusion est non seulement fausse, mais absurde. Revenons quelques siècles en arrière. Génétiquement, la population était sensiblement la même qu’aujourd’hui. Mais peu de gens apprenaient à lire, donc peu de gens savaient lire. Par conséquent, oui, l’éducation et la famille ont un rôle déterminant dans les capacités de lecture. Par ailleurs, si l’on avait fait la même étude sur la population de l’époque, on aurait trouvé non pas 64% mais une proportion bien plus faible de déterminisme génétique, puisque les capacités de lecture étaient en premier lieu déterminées par la possibilité d’apprendre à lire. Inversement, si l’éducation était la même pour toute, par exemple si on avait institué une école publique pour tous avec des programmes nationaux strictement appliqués de manière uniforme, eh bien on trouverait que très peu de différences de quoi que ce soit sont expliquées par l’éducation, puisque ce ne serait pas un facteur variable.</p>
<p>Une assertion du type « 64% des différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques » est une mesure contextuelle, qui reflète en grande partie la variabilité de chacun des facteurs. En aucun cas elle n’indique un rôle causal faible pour l’éducation ou l’environnement familial. Elle peut tout aussi bien indiquer une certaine homogénéité de l’éducation reçue. Tout ce qu’elle indique, tout ce qu’indique cette littérature en général, c’est que les facultés cognitives sont influencées par des facteurs à la fois génétiques et environnementaux.</p>
<p>Etant donné que l’on ne sait pas lire spontanément mais uniquement après l’avoir appris, il faut une certaine dose d’aveuglement idéologique pour prétendre que l’école y joue un « rôle marginal ». Certes, il faut aussi avoir un cerveau pour pouvoir lire, d’où les facteurs génétiques. Par exemple, un ver de terre ne sait pas lire. Rien n’indique cependant que ces « 64% » de variation d’origine génétique concernent le cerveau. Il faut aussi des yeux pour pouvoir lire, par exemple. Des difficultés de lecture liés à un problème ophtalmologique d’origine génétique seront comptées dans ce total. De même, si (expérience de pensée) l’éducation des enfants étaient biaisée en fonction de facteurs physiques d’origine génétique, alors ce biais apparaîtrait également comme facteur génétique. Ce n’est sans doute pas ce que l’on veut dire par « facteur génétique des capacités de lecture », mais c’est quand même ce qui est mesuré.</p>
<p>La question qui a un intérêt politique, ce n’est pas : quelle part de la variabilité des capacités de lecture dans un contexte éducatif et socioculturel donné peut être expliqué par des variations génétiques (neurogénétiques ou non, purement biologiques ou conditionnés à des facteurs socioculturels) mais plutôt : dans quelle mesure améliorer l’éducation peut-il améliorer les capacités de lecture ? Pour répondre, on peut faire appel à l’histoire plutôt qu’à la génétique, et la conclusion est sans appel : historiquement, plus de gens ont su lire lorsqu’on leur a enseigné la lecture.</p>
<p>En résumé, oui l’éducation a un rôle majeur dans les capacités cognitives comme la lecture, et la science ne dit pas le contraire. Evidemment.</p>

<p>My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life <em>in </em>those years?</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?</h2>
<p>“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.</p>
<p>The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367"><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.</p>
<p>“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.</p>
<p>As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.</p>
<h2>The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease</h2>
<p>Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another longevity project, the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.</p>
<p>Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.</p>
<h2>Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.</h2>
<p>Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live <em>with</em> illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.</p>
<p>It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.</p>
<p>Regardless of their age, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289">research</a> indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?</h2>
<p>In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.</p>
<p>Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p>The older you get the happier you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159"><em>The emotion paradox in the aging brain</em></a>, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.</p>
<blockquote><p>When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<h2>When does old age begin?</h2>
<p>We can’t seem to make up our minds, and the older we get, the further we move the goalposts marking the last season of our lives.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/06/29/growing-old-in-america-expectations-vs-reality/">2009 survey</a> of Americans asked participants when they believed someone grew ‘old’.</p>
<p>Young folks in their twenties believed said old age began at 60. Those under 50 put the threshold closer to 70, whereas those 65 and above said that the average person does not become old until turning 74.</p>
<p>Getting old wasn’t nearly as bad as people think it will be. Nor was it quite as good.</p>
<p>On the downside, one in four adults ages 65 surveyed reported memory loss. One in five had a serious illness, are no longer sexually active, or often feel sad or depressed, lonely or have trouble paying bills. One in ten felt like a burden.</p>
<p>On the upside, the same group said they have more time for hobbies, travel, volunteer work, and more financial security. Of all the good things about getting old, the best by far, according to older adults, is being able to spend more time with family members.</p>
<h2>“Am I Old? Certainly not!”</h2>
<p>One of my boys said to me recently he couldn’t imagine me as a little girl and how did it feel to finally be “old”. I told him I feel the same now as I did when I was 10.</p>
<p>“Am I Old? Certainly not!” This was the answer survey respondents gave too.</p>
<p>In fact, the older they got, the younger they said they feel. About half of those under 30 said they felt their age. But those who were 75 and older? Just 35% say they feel “old”.</p>
<p>It seems we remain on intimate terms with our much younger selves — I sometimes wonder how ten-year old me suddenly became forty-three?</p>
<h2>We enter the end of our lifespan with our past woven intimately into our biology.</h2>
<p>From birth, our neural architecture is shaped by life’s ups and downs, the decisions we made, the places where we lived, worked and learned, the meaning we’ve derived, and who we loved, gave life to, and travelled with through time. How we spend our early years will determine how we age.</p>
<p>More and more of us are living to into old age, and there has never been a better time in which to do so. Our large clever human brains have bequeathed us with modern medicine and tools with which we manage our reproductive health, avoid maternal and neonatal death, vaccinate against disease, prevent pain, treat infection and some cancers, and perform surgery if required.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, women lived barely long enough to see out their 50s. A baby girl born today can expect to live to see out the first decades of the 22<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the secrets of exceptional longevity</h2>
<p>On February 21, 1875, one year before the Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, cinema, and on a trip to Paris saw the Eiffel tower being built. When she was 13, Jeanne met Vincent Van Gogh; although apparently, she was less than impressed saying he was ”…very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick…”.</p>
<p>In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf, and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and “alert as a hummingbird” till the end. The French called her “la doyenne de l’humanitè” (the elder of humankind) and she still holds <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11520-2_16">the record</a> for the world’s longest ever living human (although this has been recently <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/">challenged</a>).</p>
<p>In April 2017, the latest longevity record holder, Emma Martina Luigia Morano of Vercelli, Italy, died aged 117. Born in November 1899, Morano was the last known living person who was born in the 1800s. According to the Guinness Book of Records, Morano followed the same extraordinary diet for around 90 years: three eggs per day (two raw, one cooked), fresh Italian pasta, and a dish of raw meat. The current longevity crown belongs to Polish Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal, who celebrated his 113th birthday in September 2017.</p>
<h2>Once rare as diamonds, the oldest of the old are the fastest growing sector of our global population.</h2>
<p>If you were born in 1900, the odds of living till age 100 were less than 1 in a million, and few people lived long enough see out the 1950s. For girls born into wealthy countries today, the odds of blowing out 100 candles on a cake are roughly 1 in 50.</p>
<p>Israel Kristal claims he doesn’t know the secret of his long life.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that everything is determined from above and we shall never know the reasons why. There have been smarter, stronger and better-looking men then me who are no longer alive. All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked her secrets, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that … I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes. Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hard work, raw eggs, biking, and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wait. For death and journalists.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Blue Zones lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>In another longevity project, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner together Professor Michel Poulain famously described five ‘<a href="https://www.bluezones.com/">Blue Zones</a>’ around the globe where the residents live to exceptional old age. Despite being very different parts of the world, there are commonalities to the resident’s lifestyles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their longevity has nothing to do with brute discipline, diets, exercise programs or supplements… In Blue Zones areas around the world, longevity happens to people. It’s the result of the right environment that constantly nudges them into moving more, eating more plants and beans while eating less meat and sugar, socializing with the right people and living out their values. It’s that simple, really.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Residents of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, prioritise friendship and family, and they almost never work extra hours if it means they have to forego a good party. They also foster ‘plan de vida’ or ‘a reason to live’.</li>
<li>In Loma Linda, California, the strong sense of purpose, day of rest, no-smoking policy, and healthy diet practices of the local Seventh Day Adventist community has rubbed off on the health of the whole town.</li>
<li>Residents of the mountainous villages of Sardinia, Italy and the Greek island of Ikaria, nap, fast, grow their own food, and drink wine daily with friends. It’s thought the clean air, warm breezes and rugged terrain of the Mediterranean islands draw locals outdoors to move naturally.</li>
<li>The residents of the Japanese islands of Okinawa, home to the world’s longest living women, are dedicated to family. Okinawans practice ‘Hara hachi bu’, a reminder to stop eating when they’re 80% full, ‘Ikigai’, which roughly translates to “Why I wake up in the morning,” and form ‘Moais’, groups of five friends that remain committed to each other for live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buettner has distilled the lifestyle practices of Blue Zones into lessons for longevity. As he says, to make it to 100 you may have to “win the genetic lottery”, but the average person’s life expectancy can be increased by moving move, prioritising friends, family and social gatherings, eating less, drinking wine, and fostering a sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Sydney Centenarian Study lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>Due to the rarity of extremely old folks, the <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/research-projects/sydney-centenarian-study">Sydney Centenarian Study</a> has partnered with a consortium of centenarian research teams from around the globe to pool their resources and data to enable more powerful conclusions to be drawn. Their data support the Blue Zones observations.</p>
<p>Charlene Levitan, who once headed up the Sydney Centenarian Study says,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is emerging from the global research is that around 30% of longevity is contributed by genetics. The remaining 70% is to do with our lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, exercise, and remaining socially integrated.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest themes to emerge is related to the personality traits of resilience, adaptability and optimism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of our centenarians will report optimism as a life-long personality characteristic.</p></blockquote>

<h4>How brains learn diseases, and their cures</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/1*slNjzwmTKuHo03_bW86V-Q.png" /></figure><p>My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.</p><p>Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are <em>cells</em>, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.</p><p>Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-to-unlearn-a-disease">epileptic patients report</a> that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-dostoevsky-epilepsy-was-a-matter-of-both-life-and-literature">aura</a>’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.</p><p>SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012372">Rivlin et al., 2013</a>). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517513/">Giaccia, Simon, &amp; Johnson, 2004</a>). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705794">Kemp &amp; Peers, 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728482/">Nei, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821532/">Richerson, 2010</a>). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897710">P-Codrea, et al., 2005</a>), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468748">Takano et al., 2007</a>). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.</p><p>The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one <em>learned</em> by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.</p><p>The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol><li>Interestingly, SUDEP is more prevalent among males, and males tend to be more sensitive to hypoxia, suffering worse outcomes. This has been found true both in clinical studies and in studies involving multiple animal models (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474588">Hill &amp; Fitch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542909">Mayoral, Omar, &amp; Penn, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889641">Mirza, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149081">Pérez-Crespo et al., 2005</a>). This sexual dimorphism may be due, in part, to the gene G6PD, an X-linked gene related to oxidative stress, which has been implicated in hypoxia-induced damage (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063801">Chettimada et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225644">Gao, L., et al., 2004</a>). It’s also worth noting that in a rodent model, sleep apnea-induced plasticity of the breathing circuit was normalized with antioxidant treatment, which may similarly show a protective effect in high SUDEP risk patients. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress may play an important role in detecting and preventing SUDEP.</li><li>Some researchers believe that SUDEP is related to another medical mystery, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the best known risk factors for SIDS is prenatal nicotine exposure, and nicotine exposure is known to alter receptor expression in oxygen-sensing neural circuits; therefore both diseases may result from plasticity of the brain areas responsible for controlling breathing.</li><li>SUDEP has also been associated with a variety of genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as well as several anti-convulsive drugs that also make patients prone to arrhythmias (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372310">Klassen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989471/">Glasscock, 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>). However, genes do not deterministically dictate SUDEP risk. Given that genetic tests are costly, and only suggestive of susceptibility, a functional measurement such as apnea would likely be a more effective biomarker.</li></ol><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ced1cb1b3545" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/thoughts-on-a-medical-mystery-ced1cb1b3545">Thoughts on a medical mystery</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/602950398/0/oupblogpsychology/">When narcolepsy makes you more creative</a></h4>

<p>At night, the surrealist poet Saint-Pol-Roux used to hang a sign on his bedroom’s door that read: “Do not disturb: poet at work.” Indeed, may sleep increase our creativity? The link between creativity and sleep has been a topic of intense speculation, mainly based on anecdotal reports of artistic and scientific discoveries people have made while dreaming. Dmitri Mendeleev supposedly came up with the arrangement that became the periodic table while asleep. Yet, scientific proof of such a relationship remains scarce. To investigate the long-term effect of sleep on creativity, clinicians and scientists from Sorbonne University, Paris, France, and Bologna University, Italy, called upon experts of sleep and dreams: patients with narcolepsy.</p><p>Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder characterised by uncontrolled sleep attacks. These naps are special, as they often start immediately with a specific sleep stage named rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas healthy subjects need to sleep for roughly one hour before entering REM sleep. Therefore, patients with narcolepsy have a swift access to REM sleep, a stage associated with robust dreaming activity. They also present many symptoms showing that the boundary between wakefulness and REM sleep is blurry. For example, most narcolepsy patients are lucid dreamers, meaning that they are conscious of dreaming while dreaming, to the point of sometimes having control over their dreams. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130">It has also been shown that naps containing REM sleep are followed by a period of increased mental flexibility, in turn favouring problem solving</a>. Given their life-long privileged access to REM sleep and dreams, may patients with narcolepsy have developed over time higher creative abilities than average?</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awz137">To answer this question, the authors compared the creative abilities of patients with narcolepsy with healthy subjects</a>. Defining and measuring creativity is not an easy task. In this research field, creativity is commonly defined as the ability to produce work that is both original and adapted to constraints. In order to obtain a picture of creativity as detailed and complete as possible, the authors asked participants to complete various tasks.</p><p>First, 185 patients with narcolepsy and 126 healthy subjects completed two questionnaires on creativity. The first questionnaire explores your creative profile and score, through 57 questions, and concludes whether one is innovative, imaginative, or a researcher.  Then, in the second questionnaire subjects report creative achievements (from being a complete beginner to being a national star) in various domains of arts and sciences, including writing, theatre/film, humour, inventions, or culinary arts. The results of these two questionnaires provide a subjective measure of creativity. Next, researchers tested the creative performances of 30 patients with narcolepsy and 30 healthy subjects during a face-to-face two-hour long test of creativity, named the Evaluation of Creative Potential. The divergent-exploratory thinking, a thought process used to generate creative ideas, was tested by finding the greatest number of solutions to a problem (e.g., “Invent the maximum of shapes using two triangles”). The convergent-integrative thinking, the ability to give the correct answer to questions that do not require significant creativity, was tested by combing several elements into a coherent pattern (e.g., drawings a scene based on seven shapes, or writing a story that includes an animal, an old man, the suburb and three cars).</p><p>Globally, subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher creative scores than the healthy subjects, for both the subjective and the objective measures, and in all forms of creative profiles. Most symptoms of narcolepsy (sleepiness, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, but not treatments) were also associated with higher scores of creativity.</p><p>This increased creativity may be a result of more frequent opportunities for patients with narcolepsy to incubate ideas during daytime naps (with REM sleep). Moreover, the high dream recall frequency observed in narcolepsy may also provide them with a high pool of inspiring new ideas.</p><p>For the first time, an increased creativity is demonstrated in subjects with narcolepsy, providing a silver lining to this disastrous disease. These young adults are often considered lazy, but it appears their proficient lucid dreaming and creative abilities may help researchers better understand the role of dreaming in everyone’s life.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Grayscale photo of sleeping woman lying on bed” by Kinga Cichewicz.

<span>A professor in the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">), </span><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0278-8295">Arianna Becerril-García</a><span style="color: black;"> is also the Executive Director of </span><a href="https://www.redalyc.org/home.oa">Redalyc</a><span style="color: black;">, the Network of Scientific Journals from Latin America and the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal. Redalyc is a regional open access portal for the social sciences and humanities that indexes 1,305 local journals and hosts the full texts of more than 650,000 articles.</span></span><span> </span><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s1600/Photo_edited.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="655" data-original-width="679" height="192" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s200/Photo_edited.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>In addition, Becerril-García is the Chair of a new project called </span><span><a href="http://www.amelica.org/en/index.php/que-es-ameli/">AmeliCA</a><span style="color: black;"> (Open Knowledge for Latin America and the Global South). AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a><span style="color: black;"> – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Heeded and acted upon?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11">rumour on Twitter</a><span style="color: black;"> is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (</span><span><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge">GLOALL</a><span style="color: black;">). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  </span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.</span><br /><a name="more"></a><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – </span><span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">the oligopoly</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (</span><span><a href="https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;Src=IP&amp;Alias=WOK5">Web of Science</a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: black;"> </span></span><span style="color: black;">and <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a></span><span style="color: black;">) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Consequently, researchers are forced to publish in journals owned by commercial publishers who are mainly based outside the region, and in order to make their work open access they now have to pay an APC.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The goal of AmeliCA is to support and consolidate a native model that has operated in Latin America for more than 30 years, a model in which the publishing process is financed in a structured and rooted manner with public resources provided via local universities.

The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span><a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm">BBB definition</a></span><span>” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina. There you can see a very strong, determined, and prepared group already using AmeliCA’s technology to sustain its journals and prevent the implementation of APCs, or the intervention of commercial publishers.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>This group is composed of researchers and students and they are being trained in publishing matters in order to sustain the work in the future.

                <h4><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html">Why did Riksbankens Jubileumsfond decide to leave cOAlition S?</a></h4>

<span>Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>Plan S</span></a><span>. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.</span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Simeon87 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG">CC BY-SA</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><br /><span></span><span>Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home">a petition</a> of protest being launched. <span>  </span></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/">revised guidelines</a> last week (31st May). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “</span><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s"><span>welcomed</span></a><span>” them, as </span><a href="http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/"><span>have</span></a><span> open access advocates.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were </span><a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/"><span>10 funders</span></a><span>; today there are still only </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>19</span></a><span>. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the </span><a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php"><span>two largest producers of research papers in the world</span></a><span> – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.</span><br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en"><span>RJ</span></a><span>) to leave the coalition. RJ</span><span>’</span><span>s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>How, when and why did RJ leave?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 6<sup>th</sup> March RJ published </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an open letter</span></a><span> addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Leave or remain?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day (7<sup>th</sup> March) RJ posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20"><span>tweet</span></a><span> saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/"><span>a note</span></a><span> on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (</span><span>May 28</span><sup>th</sup><span>) RJ </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that it had left the coalition.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Confusingly, although the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6<sup>th</sup>, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7<sup>th</sup> March.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin">Marika Hedin</a>. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1<sup>st</sup> February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “</span><span>No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Evolved</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6<sup>th</sup>letter. It is also</span><span> not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">10 Plan S Principles</a><span>– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More puzzling perhaps, the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>When I </span><span>asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and </span><a href="https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/"><span>Head of Open Research</span></a><span>at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31<sup>st</sup> May).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? </span><span>“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until <i>after</i> the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;A. She replied, “</span><span>Thank you, but I have no further comments.</span><span>After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Openness and transparency</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm. And this change appears to date from<a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html"> the point at which funders began to take up the cause</a> and started introducing ever more oppressive OA mandates. Increasingly, decisions are taken behind closed doors and new rules are imposed on unwilling and hapless researchers.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And is there not a hint of hypocrisy here? Principle 5 of Plan S insists that publishers must be transparent about their pricing and processes, including their </span><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/journal-transparency-rules-help-scholars-pick-where-publish"><span>editorial policies, their decision-making, their acceptance rates and their review times</span></a><span>. Researchers, meanwhile, face ever more bureaucratic scrutiny in order to ensure compliance and are threatened with sanctions if they fail to comply.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Should we not expect cOAlition S members to live by the same rules of responsibility and transparency that they seek to force on publishers and researchers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Is it not therefore incumbent on RJ to explain in more detail what it thought it was signing up to, why it signed up if it did not understand the implications of doing so, and why it subsequently chose to leave, despite apparently having had its demands met – that is, both the timetable and the implementation of Plan S were adjusted to become more flexible? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Should we not also expect decisions about open access to be decided in a democratic and open manner? How, for instance, did signatory funders make their decisions about joining Plan S and how open to scrutiny is that decision-making process?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 27<sup>th</sup> February I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1100679321868554240"><span>invited</span></a><span> all members of cOAlition S to send me a link to, or copy of, the minutes of the meetings of the board (or similar) where it was agreed to join the coalition. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Only three funders responded and not one pointed me to any minutes. Of those who responed, two were private funders – the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation – and one a public funder, Formas. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In responding for Wellcome, Kiley <a href="https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1100168492848951296">said</a> that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been taken by the </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/executive-leadership-team"><span>Executive Leadership Team</span></a><span>. This might seem to suggest that the </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/governance/board-governors"><span>Wellcome Board</span></a><span> (which has ultimate responsibility for Wellcome’s activities) had not been consulted. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Formas </span><a href="https://twitter.com/pressformas/status/1111600447628955648"><span>replied</span></a><span> that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been made by the Director General, with no mention of the Formas </span><a href="https://formas.se/om-formas/sa-styrs-formas/forskarradet.html#Innehall"><span>Scientific Council</span></a><span> having been asked to give approval.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And the minutes of the Board meetings of the Research Council of Norway posted on the Web suggested that the funder did not discuss Plan S until three months after it had signed up. (The minutes of the meeting appear now to have been </span><a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Saklister_og_referater/1195592857784"><span>taken down</span></a><span>). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Apart from the embarrassment of signing up to an initiative like Plan S only to have the decision later overturned by the Board, this kind of executive power grab is out of tune with the open, transparent and democratic principles that the OA movement was built on. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In its letter of March 6<sup>th</sup> RJ makes </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an important point</span></a><span>: it says that by seeking to force Plan S on researchers without adequate consultation the <i>modus operandi</i> of Plan S, “has succeeded to turn researchers who have been in favour of Open Science and Robert Merton’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms"><span>CUDOS principles</span></a><span> against these positions. This is an unfortunate development.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>That perhaps is the key issue: forcing oppressive OA mandates on researchers may turn out to be counterproductive. Perhaps that is the real reason why RJ left cOAlition S: the failure to get researcher buy-in <i>before </i>announcing the initiative. But then why did RJ’s CEO sign up in the first place? Why did RJ not express concern until six months later? And why is it not willing to talk openly and publicly about what happened? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>After all, if RJ’s concerns about the dangers of seeking to force open access on researchers are valid then the issue is of wider significance than Plan S alone. It is of relevance to the very future of open access and how it is (or is not) achieved. </span></div><br />

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</a></h4>

<p>There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">critique of the neural coding metaphor</a>, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a <em>primary</em> representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a <em>secondary</em> representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/">Mark Bickhard</a>.</p>
<p>The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">subjective physics</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural coding essay</a>, and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">in my response to commentaries</a> (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/">problematic aspects</a> with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.</p>
<p>With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons <em>is</em> the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.</p>

If you delve into the wildest depths of the scientific literature, you will find a trilogy of papers so weird, that they have become legendary.



In these articles, spanning a 12 year period, author Jarl Flensmark says that heeled shoes cause mental illness, while flat footwear promotes brain health:



Is there an association between the use of heeled footwear and schizophrenia? (2004)Physical activity, eccentric contractions of plantar flexors, and  neurogenesis: therapeutic potential of fla

We hypothesize that, even before combat, soldiers with a childhood background of violence (or with a familial susceptibility risk) would benefit from being genotyped for high-risk alleles (DNA variants). This process may assist us in identifying potential military candidates who

A paper in a peer-reviewed medical journal makes the suggestion that physicist Stephen Hawking's disability, which famously confined him to a wheelchair and robbed him of his speech, was psychosomatic in nature.



Hmm. I think this says more about the author than it does about Hawking.







The paper is called Delusional Health Beliefs and it comes by British doctor Peter May. It was published a few days ago in the Medico-Legal Journal.







May begins the paper by discussing conversion di

<p>Germany’s Max Planck Society, the research powerhouse that includes the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, has been ranked as the top biomedical nonprofit organization in the world by Nature Index. <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/supplements/nature-index-2019-biomedical-sciences/tables/npo-ngo">The rankings</a> examine prominent research institutions and scientists across the world whose publications profoundly impact biomedical research. In addition to taking the top spot among nonprofit/NGO institutions, the Max Planck Society ranked fifth overall when compared to all research organizations, including major universities and government health agencies.</p>
<p>“The Max Planck Society’s unique ‘science-first’ core values create an environment for unparalleled research excellence. We are proud to be a part of the leading nonprofit research organization in the world, and to represent the Max Planck Society in the United States,” said David Fitzpatrick, CEO and Scientific Director of the Max Planck Florida Institute.</p>
<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is the only Max Planck Institute in North America. Besides the one in Jupiter, Florida, the Max Planck Society operates another 83 institutes, most of them in Germany, one in Luxemburg, two in Italy, and one in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1948, 18 Nobel laureates have emerged from the ranks of its scientists. As its first U.S. institution, MPFI brings together exceptional neuroscientists from around the world to answer fundamental questions about brain function and development and to advance new technologies that make groundbreaking scientific discoveries possible. Their research is shared publicly with scholars, universities and other organizations around the globe, providing the necessary foundation of knowledge to develop treatments and cures for brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<h2>Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</li>
<li>Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</li>
<li>Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</li>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.</p>
<p>Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions girls experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A novel optimization algorithm, called the Magnetic Optimization Algorithms (MOAs), is proposed in this paper which is inspired by the principles of magnetic field theory. In MOA, the possible solutions are some magnetic particles scattered in the search space. In this respect, each magnetic particle has a measure of mass and magnetic field according to its fitness. In this scheme, the fitter magnetic particles are more massive, with stronger magnetic field. In terms of interaction, these particles are located in a structured population and apply a long range force of attraction to their neighbors. Ten different structures are proposed for the algorithm and the structure that offers the best performance is found. Also, to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm, several operators are proposed: a repulsive short-range force, an explosion operator, a combination of short-range force and explosion operator and a crossover interaction between the neighboring particles. In order to test the proposed algorithm and the proposed operators, the algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms on 21 numerical benchmark functions. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the existing algorithms.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has seen rapid development over the last two decades. FDA refers to a collection of methods for analysing data over a curve, surface or continuum. It is very much involved with computational statistics. FDA has been applied to quite broadly in medicine, business and engineering.</p>
<p>In this talk, Yi will introduce the basic idea of FDA using a case study presented in the paper: zooming in on human growth.</p>
<p>“Human growth is not at all the simple process that one might imagine at first sight… Collecting records is time-consuming and expensive, because children have to be measured accurately and tracked for a long period of their lives.</p>
<p>[We] consider how to make this sort of record into a useful functional datum to incorporate into further analyses. A smooth curve drawn through the points is commonly called a growth curve, but growth is actually the rate of increase of the height of the child. In children this is necessarily positive… [We] develop a monotone smoothing method that takes this sort of consideration into account and yields a functional datum that picks out important stages in a child’s growth."</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses plays a principal role in learning in the cerebellum, which acts as a supervised learning machine. Recent experiments demonstrate various forms of synaptic plasticity at different sites within the cerebellum. In this article, we take into consideration synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses as well as at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and propose that the cerebellar cortex performs reinforcement learning, another form of learning that is more capable than supervised learning. We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.</p>

<h2>Stress is an inevitable part of life.</h2>
<p>We feel ‘stressed’ when real or imagined pressures exceed our perceived ability to cope. If things all feel ‘too much’, we experience the sensations of ‘stress’.</p>
<p>But feeling stress is not always a bad thing. When stress is short-term and manageable, it motivates and facilitates learning and change. Stress only becomes toxic when it’s excessive or long-lasting.</p>
<p>Long-term low level ‘hum’ of stress or short-term excessive stress can increase our risk of developing serious medical conditions such as high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>To enable the nuanced and very human responses to the diverse challenges that might come your way, the brain produces a highly coordinated and complex stress-response.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Brain Healthy and Happy?</h2>
<p>The health and happiness of our brain are our influenced by multiple interacting factors including biology, the world around us, and our thoughts, feelings and mindset.</p>
<p>One useful way to understand how our brain is influenced by so many complex factors is using the <strong>Bottom-Up, Outside-In,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Top-Down Model of Brain Health.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It’s also a useful framework to find discover different ways to buffer stress. <img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-5906" height="684" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NSA_BottomUpOutsideInTopDown-1024x778.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom-Up</strong> elements are the biological or physiological determinants of brain health and include genes, hormones, the immune system, nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices.</li>
<li><strong>Outside-In</strong> elements include social and environmental factors, stress, life events, education, current circumstances, and family background.</li>
<li><strong>Top-Down</strong> elements include thoughts, emotions, mindset, and belief systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Six Practical Stress-Busters Based on Brain Science.</h2>
<p>Using the Bottom-Up Outside-In Top-Down model, here are six practical strategies that allow you to find peace of mind amidst your challenges.</p>
<h2>Bottom-Up Approach: Change your biology</h2>
<h3>1. Get a good night sleep and indulge in a nap</h3>
<p>Sleep is the cornerstone of good brain health. While we sleep, the brain consolidates memories and goes through an amazing <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/research/research-impact/sleep-the-new-frontier-in-dementia-prevention.html?fbclid=IwAR2-_vCcGtV9BH936jTs4d5Sf24qoVKGldqt0BOuGSXszIe0dZtu_N9U7Z0">‘cleaning up’ process</a> that appears to protect us from developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. Sleep also helps us manage stress by assisting with emotional regulation and the management of cortisol levels.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Sleep Action Tip</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Getting around 7 to 9 hours sleep each night is believed to be what is required for good health. One of my favourite stress reduction (and productivity) strategies is to also <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/my-tedx-talk-indulge-your-neurobiology/">take an afternoon nap</a>. Napping is a great way to “reset” from the stressors of the day, while also smoothing out emotions and increasing clarity.</p>
<h3>2. Get moving</h3>
<p>Tight shoulders, shallow breathing, tension headaches and feels of overwhelm? Exercise can help reverse the effects of stress by releasing muscle tension, increasing oxygen levels, boosting feel-good hormones (endorphins), while also using up excess adrenaline and cortisol released as part of our stress response.</p>
<p>I find exercise one of the easiest ways to reduce my stress levels, definitely easier than thought-based or mindfulness strategies. For many people, exercise becomes an effective<em> meditation in motion</em>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23795769">Exercising outside and with others has also been linked to increased mood.</a></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Move Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">When you are feeling stressed, get moving in a way that you enjoy — go for a walk, hit the gym, swim in the ocean, take a dance class, even housework can get your heart rate up!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Outside-In Approach: Change your environment to reduce stress</h2>
<h3>3. Time in nature</h3>
<p>Sunshine, light and fresh air are nature’s way of helping us chill out and gain perspective. Time in nature helps to improve mood, reduce blood pressure and can increase our ability to concentrate. Exposure to daylight can also help us sleep better, as light regulates our natural wake and sleep cycle (circadian rhythm).</p>
<p>While we have to be sun-wise (especially here in Australia!), getting some sunshine can make us feel better and improve our mood, thanks to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680471">mood-boosting effects of vitamin D</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480364">serotonin</a>, both of which increase with sun exposure.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Nature Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Head outside to get some fresh and clear your head if you feel stress rising. Incorporate time in nature during your week to keep your stress in check —try a walk by the beach in the morning, a bushwalk on the weekend, watching a sunset or sunrise, spending time in the garden.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4. Connecting with others</h3>
<p>Our brains are wired for connection. We are born as social animals and have a fundamental need for human warmth and connection, especially when we are stressed.</p>
<p>When we connect with friends and loved ones, the bonding hormone oxytocin is released in our brain. Oxytocin not only makes us feel good, but it also lowers our stress and counteracts the effects of cortisol.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Connection Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">While it can be hard to find the time (or mental energy) to socialise when we are feeling stressed, making time to have a coffee or dinner catch up with friends or family is an effective (and fun) way to take the pressure off and keep stress under control.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Top-Down Approach: Change how you think to reduce stress</h2>
<h3>5. Mindfulness</h3>
<p>When we fixate on a problem in the future or regret from the past, worry and rumination can take hold and cause stress and anxiety. Mindfulness practices train our brain to stay in the here and now.</p>
<p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837"><strong> have been seen to be effective in buffering against stress.</strong></a> By bringing our attention back to the present moment, tuning in to our senses and using our breath to slow our heart rate, we can deactivate our stress response.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Mindful Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Slow, deep-breathing exercises evoke the relaxation response. One useful way to practice deep breathing is to use the ‘box breathing’ technique: Breathe in for four seconds. Hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds. Then pause for four seconds before taking your next breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>6. Re-think your stress response</h3>
<p>How we think about stress has a considerable effect on our body. In her TED talk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en">Make Stress Your Friend</a><em>, </em>health psychologist Kelly McGonigal explains how the belief that stress is harmful is what makes stress unhealthy, not the stress itself.</p>
<p>The negative perception of stress causes the body to change in ways that have been linked to disease and a reduction in life expectancy. However, seeing the stress response as helpful and preparing us for the challenge ahead, can stop our body responding with further stress and making us unwell.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Re-thinking Action Tip:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Next time you feel stressed, notice the symptoms of stress (the racing heart, the sweaty palms), and see if you can re-frame these sensations. Can you re-think the sensation of stress as the sensation of energy, excitement or anticipation?</p>
<hr />
<p>Stress is something we all face and it can’t be avoided, and nor should we try. By working with the three core influencers of brain health, we can learn to ‘switch off’ our stress response and ‘switch on’ our relaxation response, promoting mental health and physical wellbeing.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9894">Premature Commercialization in Suicide Prediction</a></h4>

A Swedish company called Emotra make a device to detect someone's risk of suicide based on measuring the body's autonomic responses to certain sounds. It's called EDOR®.



I've been blogging about this machine for the past 18 months (1, 2, 3) because such a product, if it worked, would be very important. It could help save countless lives. Unfortunately, I don't think EDOR® has been proven to be effective. As I've argued in my previous posts, the evidence just isn't there yet.

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8<sup>th</sup> annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”</p>
<p>Wait…<em>Zombies?</em></p>
<p>While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about <span>learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.</p>
<p>“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/600918064/0/oupblogpsychology/">Explaining Freud’s concept of the uncanny</a></h4>

<p>According to his friend and biographer Ernest Jones, Sigmund Freud was fond regaling him with “strange or uncanny experiences with patients.” Freud had a “particular relish” for such stories.</p><p>2019 marks the centenary of the publication of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf">Freud’s essay, “The ‘Uncanny”.</a> Although much has been written on the essay during that time, Freud’s <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article/59/1/51/5085234">concept of the uncanny </a>is often not well understood. Typically, Freud’s theory of the uncanny is referred to under the heading of “the return of the repressed.” But Freud also offered another, more often overlooked, explanation for why we experience certain phenomena as uncanny. This has to do with the apparent confirmation of “surmounted primitive beliefs.”</p><p>According to this theory, we all inherit, both from our individual and collective pasts, certain beliefs in animistic and magical phenomena—such as belief in the existence of spirits—which most of us, Freud thought, have largely, but not totally, surmounted. “As soon as something <em>actually happens</em> in our lives,” Freud wrote, which seems to confirm a surmounted primitive belief, we get a feeling of the uncanny. Not only must the phenomenon be experienced as taking place in reality, however, it must also bring about uncertainty about what is real. As Freud put it, the phenomenon must bring about “a conflict of judgement as to whether things which been ‘surmounted’ and are regarded as incredible may not, after all, be possible.”</p><p>Consider some examples. Apparent acts of telepathy and precognition can appear to confirm belief in the omnipotence of thoughts. Waxworks and other highly lifelike human figures can appear to affirm belief in animism—the doctrine that everything is imbued with a living soul.</p><p>A remarkable illustration of Freud’s theory can be found in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/stream/MemoriesDreamsReflectionsCarlJung/Memories,%20Dreams,%20Reflections%20-%20Carl%20Jung_djvu.txt">Carl Jung’s autobiography</a>. In 1909, during a meeting between Jung and Freud, Jung “had a curious sensation,” as if his “diaphragm were made of iron and were becoming red-hot—a glowing vault.” “And at that moment,” Jung wrote, there was such a “loud report” that came from the bookcase that was standing next to them that he and Freud “started up in alarm, fearing the thing was going to topple over.” Jung said to Freud: “There, that is an example of a so-called catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.” “Oh come,’” Freud replied. “That is sheer bosh.” “You are mistaken, Herr Professor,” said Jung. “And to prove my point, I now predict that in a moment there will be another such loud report!” Jung wrote that no sooner had said these words “than the same detonation went off in the bookcase.”</p><p>“To this day I do not know what gave me this certainty.” Jung wrote. “But I knew beyond all doubt that the report would come again. Freud only stared aghast at me.”</p><p>Following the incident, Freud wrote a letter to Jung advising him to keep a “cool head.” Freud was first inclined “to ascribe some meaning” to the noise. But he subsequently made some investigations, and numerous times had observed the same noise coming from the bookcase, yet never in connection with his thoughts. “My credulity,” Freud wrote, “or at least my readiness to believe, vanished along with the spell of your personal presence.”</p><p>Freud’s theory of surmounted primitive beliefs provides an explanation for why Freud experienced the sounding bookcase uncanny. It also provides an explanation for why the event had a different effect on Jung. For Freud causal connection between Jung’s thoughts and the noise was impossible. For Jung, it merely affirmed his belief in the reality of the “catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.”</p><p>Can this theory of Freud’s be used to explain all uncanny phenomena? This does not seem likely. For a start, one may have qualms about Freud’s characterisation of primitive beliefs. It also does not seem plausible that in order to experience something as uncanny one must first have held and then surmounted a belief in its reality. What if I had never believed in the existence of ghosts, does that mean I cannot experience a ghost-like apparition as uncanny?</p><p>Can these problems with Freud’s theory be overcome? That is a task for another occasion.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Early morning in NZ” by Tobias Tullius.

The brain became a celebrity this week when Ariana Grande shared the results of a scan of her brain seemingly showing signs of severe PTSD:



Is there any science behind this?

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans. If it is an Amen scan, then the 'blobs' seen on Grande's brain represent areas of increased or decreased cerebral blood flow (C

<p>Emil Dmitruk's journal club session, where he will present an overview of an EMG-CT method, while referencing various papers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.</p>

Cars clearly exhibit intelligent behaviour, being able to navigate around obstacles and follow complex instructions on road signs. How, the aliens may wonder, do the cars manage this? What is the seat of car int

<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Reporting on the scholarly publishing world can be a frustrating business these days, not just because the business model for journalism has all but collapsed but because scholarly publishers seem to be becoming increasingly reluctant to engage with reporters in a meaningful way, especially where the topic is open access. Their clear preference is to communicate by press release or managed events like webinars.</span><span> </span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s1600/SwatchSkinFront.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1028" data-original-width="1116" height="183" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s200/SwatchSkinFront.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In fact, this has been the favoured model of commercial legacy publishers for quite some time now. The pity is that it appears to be becoming the <i>modus operandi</i> for non-profit OA publishers and OA initiatives too. Since the <i>raison d’être</i> of OA is openness and transparency this is unfortunate. If nothing else, it smacks of hypocrisy.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>PLOS has been guilty of this in the past – see for instance </span><span><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/05/13/plos-stakeholders-and-shareholders/">this</a> from 2013. </span><span>On another occasion in 2011, when PLOS ONE published a controversial paper, I emailed a list of questions to the editorial director (after being invited to do so) only to later receive a message from the publisher saying that it had been decided not to respond to those questions. (As outlined in </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/03/plos-one-open-access-and-future-of.html"><span>this article</span></a><span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Until recently, I had assumed that <i>eLife </i>at least was fully committed to openness. In 2016, for instance, it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication"><span>posted details</span></a><span> of its publishing costs. But now I am not so sure.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I will preface my further remarks by saying that <i>eLife</i> is a frequent publisher of </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press"><span>press releases</span></a><span>, and routinely emails me copies of them. In response, I am assiduous in posting details of these releases on social media. As I see it, the relationship between <i>eLife</i> and reporters like me is a two-way thing: I publicise their press releases; they answer my questions. Simples!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, it would seem <i>eLife</i> may not see it in the same way. Let me explain. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /><a name="more"></a><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Signalling something important?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Last month, I was invited to take part in a press briefing webinar with the new <i>eLife</i> Editor-in-Chief </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen"><span>Mike Eisen</span></a><span>, who has replaced the founding EiC </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman"><span>Randy Schekman</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>During the briefing, practically all the questions posed by journalists were about business models and APCs. These did not seem to me to be questions best directed at an EiC, and in fact, Eisen had little to say in response other than that he believes APCs to be problematic and in any case the focus should be on achieving open access, not worrying about the details of business models. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In subsequently reflecting on the event it occurred to me that the appointment of Eisen is not simply the replacement of one EiC with another Rather, <i>eLife</i> is surely signalling something important about its future. So far as I am aware this point has not been made by <i>eLife</i> however, and it was not something explored in the press briefing, or indeed in subsequent reporting of the appointment (so far as I am aware).  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Maybe I am wrong, but that seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion to reach if one considers that Eisen’s OA advocacy in recent years has been almost exclusively focused on the need to move beyond the journal in favour of preprint archives and post-publication peer review, which is not what <i>eLife</i> is about. As Eisen </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>put it</span></a><span> in a recent Reddit Q&amp;A, “I would advocate doing away with ALL journals – not just for profit journals. The issue is that the idea of a journal as an entity that accepts or rejects papers and ‘publishes’ them is antiquated.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Eisen outlined his ideas on this in a post last year where he </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise"><span>described</span></a><span> what he calls an APPRAISE system.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>By contrast, <i>eLife</i> has (so far as I am aware) always positioned itself as a high-quality OA competitor to <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>. (I.e. a kind of OA mirror image of those journals). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Moreover, when pressed by its funders to become sustainable, <i>eLife </i>chose not to try something new and different, but simply emulated other publishers by introducing APCs (</span><span>$2,500 per article). It has yet to achieve sustainability, but in February the outgoing EiC <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">appeared to indicate</a> that the objective and approach remained the same, with sustainability expected to be achieved (in the next two or three years) by a doubling of the number of submissions to <i>eLife</i>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As I say, this seems very different to Eisen’s view of the world. And that is why I am inclined to conclude that his appointment suggests that <i>eLife</i> is planning to reinvent itself. Either that or there is some kind of misalignment between <i>eLife’s</i> world view and that of its new EiC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is just speculation because, as far I am aware, <i>eLife</i> has not stated that it is planning to reinvent itself. Anyway, I was by now sufficiently intrigued that </span><span>when <i>eLife’s</i> press officer contacted me after the briefing, I responded with some questions. And when it seemed that I was not making much progress that way, I suggested doing a formal Q&amp;A with <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director Mark Patterson. I was told that he was happy to do this and so emailed over the list of questions below. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Unfortunately, in a strange echo of my experience with PLOS, a week later I received an email saying, “We’ve reviewed the questions that you sent over, and there’s not much more that we’re able to add in response at this stage.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In a subsequent email I was told, “The answers to the questions we have not already addressed will become clear in time, and we’ll be happy to share more information as it’s available. Having seen all your questions, it’s simply that we’re not prepared to answer them all right now.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Out of sync?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I get that if <i>eLife</i> is in the middle of a strategic review it might not want to provide detailed answers to one or two of my questions, but for Patterson not to answer any of the questions I sent below seems out of sync both with <i>eLife’s</i> claimed commitment to openness and transparency, and with the unspoken contract I believe should exist between organisations and those like me who report on them: I publicise their news and developments; they answer my questions. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Either way, I have to wonder why <i>eLife</i> was not willing to answer some of the questions. Why, for instance, was it not prepared to say whether Eisen has ever had an EiC position before.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Likewise, why seven months after the initiative was announced was <i>eLife </i>not prepared to share with me its views on Plan S, why was it not prepared to say how many APC waivers it is granting, and why was it not prepared to rehearse for me the results of the peer review trial it held last year? Why also was it not prepared to say whether it believes Read-and-Publish agreements will prove cheaper than the traditional Big Deal, and what impact these agreements might have on small publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>More puzzlingly, why if he was unwilling to answer any of the questions I sent him did Patterson agree to do an interview in the first place?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is all the more baffling to me given that the day before <i>eLife</i> emailed to say it was not prepared to answer my questions, Eisen was introducing himself on Reddit by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>saying</span></a><span> that his objective is “to build a new ecosystem of scholarly publishing based not on journals, but on immediate, author-driven publication coupled with post-publication peer review and curation, and the role I envision <i>eLife</i> will play in this new ecosystem”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In that Q&amp;A he also said, “F1000Research isn’t, at least not yet, interested in doing anything beyond technical peer review of papers. They do an excellent job of this, but it’s a different problem than what I was thinking with APPRAISE, and now what I want to do at <i>eLife</i>, which is to help organize the literature, to help people find what’s interesting and important to them, and to help contextualize works for readers, and to help authors and people potentially interested in hiring, promoting or funding them to know what the community thinks of the quality and impact of their work.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Could not <i>eLife</i> have responded to my questions about its future strategy by at least saying something similar to that?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Financial models?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is worth noting that the very </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise#comment-155"><span>first question</span></a><span> posted in response to Eisen’s outline of his APPRAISE idea was, “Fascinating stuff, but what’s the financial model here?” – a question to which Eisen did not respond. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Certainly, if the new strategy of <i>eLife</i> involves making APPRAISE a reality some kind of a financial modelling will be necessary, not least because if the publisher is still not sustainable and its funders expect it to become so in the next few years, it will presumably need to find additional resources from somewhere. In other words, while business models may not be something Eisen is concerned about, someone at <i>eLife</i> needs to take an interest in them. It was partly in order to gain some understanding of this that I invited Patterson to do a formal Q&amp;A. And I asked him specifically because as <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director I assume that is his bag. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Doubtless the open source </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/33e4127f/elife-introduces-libero-a-new-open-source-tool-for-publishing"><span>Libero</span></a><span> products that <i>eLife</i> is co-developing are relevant here too. And I was again puzzled that <i>eLife</i> was not prepared to answer my question about its open source activities even though it has been giving webinars on the topic (e.g. </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/f8226477/in-publishing-the-latest-on-the-open-source-publishing-platform-libero"><span>here</span></a><span>). I can only conclude that while <i>eLife</i> is happy to broadcast press releases and organise managed events, it is reluctant to answer specific questions from reporters outside of these managed events. A cynic might think that this is because reporters tend to ask probing questions – questions like, “Was that a wise decision you made?” and “Where is the business model here?”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is also worth pointing out that in the webinar linked above <i>eLife</i> <u>was</u> asked about business models. The reply was that business models are not relevant to non-profits, which have only to achieve sustainability. This seems to me to miss the point that in order to achieve sustainability some kind of financial model is necessary – as Knowledge Unlatched </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html"><span>discovered</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The fact is that regardless of any new development work Eisen might be hoping to see at <i>eLife</i>, 30% of its expenditures are already going towards “technology and innovation”. Moreover, <i>eLife</i> has made it clear that Libero Publisher is being developed as a post-peer-review publishing platform, not some kind of preprint APPRAISE solution. If those authors (and/or their institutions) who are now having to pay <i>eLife</i> APCs find themselves having to subsidise a growing number of technology projects, they might start to feel a little aggrieved.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Presumably, <i>eLife</i> hopes that at some point it will be able to earn revenue from providing software-as-a-service solutions around Libero – much as </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/"><span>Public Knowledge Project</span></a><span> does with its </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/"><span>Open Journal Systems</span></a><span> platform. The challenge, of course, is that developing new publishing workflow systems is neither easy nor cheap, as PLOS <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/">discovered</a>. True <i>eLife</i> is sharing the load with third parties – but even so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This post is about my personal disappointment with <i>eLife</i>, but I believe there is a wider issue here: what I perceive to be a decreasing level of openness in the OA movement – an issue I have previously raised </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html"><span>here</span></a><span>. I think we can see the same trend evident in the way in which Plan S was developed and proposed. But do not those who advocate for open access and greater transparency (which, we could note, they consistently demand of legacy publishers) have a responsibility to walk the talk themselves, not least by answering reporters’ questions? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Be that as it may, I await with interest to learn more about the future <i>eLife</i> sees for itself in the developing new world of scholarly communication, the role that its new EiC will play in this, and whether the task it set itself in 2012 is about to be recalibrated in a significant way.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is just a shame that after appointing a new EiC <i>eLife</i> seems unwilling to answer questions about the significance of its choice, or even answer questions about current OA developments like Plan S and Read-and-Publish agreements. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Anyway, for the record, I am posting below the questions I sent to Patterson.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Questions for Mark Patterson </span></h3><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Mike Eisen’s appointment as <i>eLife</i>’s new Editor-in-Chief is an interesting development. As I understand it, <i>eLife</i> was founded in 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust as a high-quality open-access journal intended to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/infographic-how-is-elife-measuring-up">compete with</a> </span><span>prestigious subscription journals like <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i> and <i>Cell</i>. Its first Editor-in-Chief was the besuited, suave Nobel prize winner Randy Schekman. Eisen is the rumbustious T-short wearing co-founder of PLOS. It was PLOS that in 2003 pioneered use of the article-processing charge (APC) and it was PLOS that in 2006 launched PLOS ONE, which is committed to publishing any paper deemed to be <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines">technically rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record</a>.  </span><span>The PLOS ONE </span><span>model has been characterised by some as <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html">bulk-publishing</a></span><span>. Eisen is also a firm <a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise">advocate for preprints</a></span><span> and in 2017 <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2017/10/q-with-plos-co-founder-michael-eisen.html">said to me</a>,</span><span> “We should all publish in bioRxiv and review papers outside of journals. It’s the only way forward.”</span><span> This would seem to be a very different view of scholarly publishing to the one that has been espoused by <i>eLife</i> to date, and so must signal a change of direction for <i>eLife</i>. How would you characterise that new direction?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Has Mike Eisen ever worked as an Editor-in-Chief before?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> was wholly subsidised by funders for the first five years, but in 2017 it introduced an APC of $2,500. It has, however, yet to become sustainable. Doubtless, that is why during the press call that Eisen gave on March 5<sup>th</sup> all bar one of the questions asked by journalists were about business models and APCs. Responsibility for business models and financial matters at <i>eLife</i> is not in fact part of Eisen’s job description. Who is responsible to the <i>eLife</i> Board for business models, financial sustainability and strategy? You as Executive Director perhaps?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>When pushed on APCs during the press call Eisen said that he views them as problematic. He did not, however, propose </span><span>any alternative way of funding <i>eLife</i>. Instead, he said that since there is enough money in the current subscription system the research community should simply focus on achieving OA rather than worrying over the details of business models. All that is needed, he said, is to reallocate subscription money to pay for OA. Leaving aside the problem of how one does that, I am wondering if the claim holds up. One of the primary reasons why librarians have been calling for open access over the past 20-odd years is that they say they cannot afford the subscription model, which they believe to be unsustainable. Their assumption has always been that open access will be cheaper and so can solve their affordability problem. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated that OA is cheaper. Nevertheless, librarians continue to insist that they should pay publishers less money. One of the reasons UC gave for walking away from its negotiations with Elsevier recently, for instance, was that the publisher was not prepared to reduce what it charges the university. As Jeff MacKie-Mason <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/02/28/why-uc-split-with-publishing-giant-elsevier/">has explained</a>,</span><span> UC set two goals when it began the negotiation: “a reduction in costs and default open access publication for UC authors”. At the same time, we could note that the <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/all-corporate-news/wiley-and-projekt-deal-partner-enhance-future-scholarly-research-an">Wiley/Project DEAL Read-and-Publish agreement</a></span><span> is not expected to be any cheaper than a traditional Big Deal. Do <i>you</i> think open access will reduce the costs of scholarly publishing? If not, will there not continue to be an unresolved problem in an OA world?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>As noted, despite introducing an APC, <i>eLife</i> is still not sustainable. The funders supporting the publisher say they want it to do so in the near future. In an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">interview</a></span><span> he gave to <i>Nature</i> in February, Randy Schekman said, “The journal still receives income from charitable funders, as well as from article-processing charges. But we hope for <i>eLife</i> to be self-sustaining within two or three years. The financial models we have drawn show that it can be done.” He added, “We believe that <i>eLife</i> has the bandwidth to grow maybe two-fold in submissions — and if we do this, we can sustain ourselves without charitable funding.” Eisen seemed unaware of this financial modelling at the time of the press call. Can you say more about it? Is it </span><span>enough (and even possible) to double submissions in the next two or three years? <i>eLife’s </i><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/50d52087/annual-report-looking-back-on-2017">2017 annual report</a></span><span> indicated that submissions fell after the introduction of an APC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In that same report, <i>eLife</i> said that around half of its submissions did not attract a fee. </span><span>I think this was partly because APCs were <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication">introduced during the reporting period</a>. </span><span>However, <i>eLife</i> does also offer <a href="https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#waiver">waivers</a></span><span> for “labs under financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or a lack of funding.” What percentage of the papers <i>eLife </i>is currently publishing are attracting a waiver, and how do you see this changing over time?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> operates a novel open and consultative peer review system. Last year it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2905802e/peer-review-elife-trials-a-new-approach"><span>announced a trial</span></a><span> to test the feasibility of what it called “a radical form of peer review” in which “once an editor has invited a manuscript for full peer review, the journal is committed to publishing the work along with the reviewer reports, the decision letter, and the author response.” Some initial results of that trial have been published </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/262c4c71/peer-review-first-results-from-a-trial-at-elife"><span>here</span></a><span>. But how would you summarise these results and how do you envisage peer review developing in future, both at <i>eLife</i> and generally in scholarly publishing, particularly in light of the growing preprint movement and Eisen’s view that peer review ought to take place “outside of journals”?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>I may have missed it, but I do not believe <i>eLife</i> has published a response to Plan S.

Open access is the future. Commercial journals have been fighting against this very hard because it poses a clear danger to their profit margin … There will be a shakedown in the business. Some journals will lose out.” Is that <i>eLife’s </i>official position? If not, what is its position?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In light of the Project DEAL/ Wiley agreement, I am thinking that this model (and/or the Read-and-Publish </span><span>one) is likely to become the norm going forward, and I assume such deals will eventually be done with Elsevier. The problem for <i>eLife</i> I would think is that these are essentially new-style Big Deals, a model that inevitably favours large commercial legacy publishers and by its very nature tends to elbow aside small publishers like <i>eLife</i>. Unable to cut such deals with libraries, funders and/or consortia might it be that <i>eLife </i>will be one of the journals to lose out (as Schekman puts it)? How can it best adapt to the kind of changes that initiatives like Plan S are likely to introduce?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> has been actively collaborating with third-parties</span><span> (including the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation, <a href="https://coko.foundation/">Coko</a></span><span>) to build open source publishing solutions.

<p>Na Helian's journal club session, where she will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf">OPTICS Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (Mihael Ankerst et al, 1999)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-datasets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to thedensity-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.</p>

<h4>TL;DR talk to current students &amp; trust your instincts</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1sJEGa_4vSgBEHSvfrFn0g.jpeg" />Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/">Tony Webster</a> (Flickr Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0))</figure><p>Recruitment season is finally over, and you have a couple of weeks to decide where you’d like to spend the next chunk of your life. After several weekends spent explaining your research in 10-minute segments to complete strangers, you’re hoping to ultimately have a place to call <em>lab</em>, and a city to call <em>home</em>.</p><p>As you look back on your visits, it’s a whirlwind of graduate students, science, faculty members, walking, and beer. How, in Carl Sagan’s name, are you supposed to choose one school over another? To complicate such decisions, opaque ranking systems are putting dubious numerical values on your hodgepodge of memories and tired feet.</p><p>I’m no expert on choosing graduate schools or advisors — after all, I’ve only done it once. However, I’ve witnessed my colleagues disperse in all sorts of directions as far as institutions and advisors, some for better, and some for <em>ehh </em>not so good.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*7HIduiCLF0tvZAuo.gif" /></figure><p><strong>Who are you? </strong>Before comparing programs, it’s a good idea to do some personal reflection. It’s impossible to know how you’ll feel at the end of graduate school, or even in a year, but your current decision depends on how you feel now. Check in with yourself:</p><ul><li>Why are you going to graduate school?</li><li>What do you see yourself doing after graduate school?</li><li>With those two answers in mind, how long would you like to spend in graduate school?</li><li>Based on prior work experience, consider the kind of leadership you work well with. Do you prefer supervisors to be hands-off, or very involved in your daily activities?</li><li>Consider taking <a href="http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/">this comprehensive survey</a> sponsored by AAAS to help identify your needs, strengths, and weaknesses, as well your career options.</li></ul><p>Now, young reckless Jedi, ready are you?</p><h4><strong>Did you like the students?</strong></h4><p>This is a major aspect of visiting the campus. Did you meet people you can see being scientifically as well as socially supportive? Were they, in general, pleasant? The emotional state of students (especially those past the third year) is incredibly indicative of the health of a graduate program. Think about the kind of people you want to be surrounded by for the next five years; even if the individuals change, the ethos of the program is unlikely to change that quickly.</p><h4><strong>All together now.</strong></h4><p>Science thrives in a collaborative and cohesive environment built on personalities that promote these characteristics. Ask students if they would feel comfortable asking another student in the program for experience or insight on a particular project or technique. In most of the places I’ve worked, people readily email around to borrow reagents or equipment and research moves quicker as a result. An institution that promotes collaboration across students and labs is likely to be a happier and better place to do science.</p><h4><strong>Make sure there are five advisors you can imagine yourself working with </strong>(applicable for programs with research rotations).</h4><p>Hopefully, you’ve heard this already: do not choose an institution for <em>one</em> star faculty member. Yes, you interviewed with them and the research is absolutely jaw dropping, but you should not depend on one person unless you have an explicit agreement with them or extensive prior experience with the lab.</p><p>Make sure there are 2–3 people you’re confident would be a good fit, with at least another 2 that you see as very strong possibilities. Reflect on your own goals for the type of research you hope to do (behind a computer or a lab bench?) and make sure the institution has several faculty members in each corner of your comfort zone.</p><p>Lastly, compare your expectations for the length of your PhD to the program’s average as well as the labs that interest you. Some advisors regularly have graduate students for 7+ years, whereas others are known for graduating students much earlier. You might not mind sticking around for 7 years, but it’s a good thing to know in advance.</p><h4><strong>Ask ahead of time about funding.</strong></h4><p>If you’re not coming in with your own funding, make sure the program will fund you for at least the first year. It is a very good sign if the program has <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants">an institutional training grant</a> (hint: you can search for your institution/organization on <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/">NIH RePORT</a>).</p><p>If you’re worried about funding in a particular lab, it is definitely okay to ask if they will be able to fund you. Funding is a fact of life in science; the earlier you have those open conversations, the better off you’ll be.</p><h4><strong>Ensure there is administrative infrastructure for student support.</strong></h4><p>You want an administration that will help structure your experience in graduate school, elicit and implement your feedback, as well as springboard you into the next phase of your career. Graduate school can be quite amorphous without some structure; although this is okay for some students, it can be unmanageable for others.</p><p>Some programs involve students on executive committees and schedule yearly feedback meetings. Not only does this demonstrate that the program cares, but also that it is organized enough internally to seek external advice. It’s definitely a plus if the department takes the time and money to plan seminar series and social events for students.</p><h4><strong>It’s not <em>all </em>about the science.</strong></h4><p>Of course, you want to attend a university with an abundance of top-notch research, but you also need to be in a place where you can be a happy person. It is not shallow or unprofessional to choose a place where you think you’ll feel safe and at ease. You might decide that you’d prefer to be in a bustling city versus a quiet suburb, or in a place that offers cultural and social opportunities that fit your needs. You’ll spend long hours in the lab, but you also need long hours relaxing and doing things that you love, like <a href="https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/the-picnic-guidelines-re-written-1a8a9ef0841c">having picnics</a>. After all, your life outside of the lab enhances your ability to do good science.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TtUmE7IrPaTvTrij3avIjA.jpeg" />It’s totally reasonable to choose a program simply because of the presence of palm trees. Too far? Too far. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)</figure><p>If you’re currently making a choice between schools, don’t hesitate to ask additional questions of your host, other graduate students, or faculty you spoke to. This is your chance to gather as much information as you can so that you can feel confident in your decision. If they don’t answer your concerns, you may have your answer right there.</p><p>Spend a week pretending you’re going to one school. Take the next week and pretend you’re going to another school. Dwell on those indescribable responses to how it feels, remain open to unforeseen opportunities, and trust your intuition. As Richard Feynman aptly said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”</p><p>This was originally posted on <a href="https://neuwritesd.org/2014/03/20/you-interviewed-now-what/"><em>NeuWriteSD</em></a><em> </em>and has been edited to update its content.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist?

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/28/the-compatibility-of-stem-and-spirituality/">Making Space for Spirituality</a></h4>

<p>Having been raised Catholic, I have a confession to make: I have found it difficult to make room for spirituality and religion in a STEM-focused society. Not in my personal life exactly, but in my community and conversations. I think it’s partly because people have such varying conceptions of spiritual life, God, or gods. And because we don’t talk about it freely, when someone does bring up anything related to this subject, it’s easy to become immediately wary: is this person trying to convert me or take my money?</p>
<p>How about a third option: what if that person is trying to tell you about a powerful experience they had, which they cannot fully explain using known, familiar concepts or which seems to be at least partly outside of human control?</p>
<p>I think, for a lot of people, it’s actually something closer to this third idea that motivates us to talk about spirituality and God. And that may be the key to why it’s hard to discuss these things in certain STEM communities. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are about curiosity, innovation, achievement – rewarding for sure – but they are also often about control and precision, human definitions and limitations.</p>
<p>In my view, if you need to know that something is conceptually possible with a certain regard for grace and beauty, you may be a mathematician. If you need to know something well enough to be confident that it will work reliably and consistently – and that you can fix it when it goes wrong – you might be an engineer or doctor. If you need to examine every little detail, control every factor and condition, and measure everything precisely and then report your findings in a strictly structured format, you are probably a hard scientist. Given each of these approaches to inquiry and the effect they may have on your world view, your conception of God is likely to be quite different.</p>
<p>You might also still feel that sense of wonder and awe that some folks ascribe to religion and spirituality. Except, instead of feeling that sense when you enter a religious venue or contemplate a starry sky, perhaps you feel that sense in the infinite combinations of factors that your experimental setup can produce. And I’m not speaking cynically of electrical noise or undetermined behavioral influences that plague experimental scientists. I mean the vast space of possibility associated with randomness, Brownian motion, genetic mutations and the like.</p>
<p>I believe that one acceptable definition of God to say God is in the things we don’t understand, in the concepts and people that we value but have not figured out. In this way, the concept of God is compatible with a fully formed and intricate understanding of biology, astronomy, natural history, and human relations. Being a generally warm-hearted and optimistic person, I also think of God as a force for love, growth, and connection between persons, nature, and other living things.</p>
<p>Beyond the concept of God or spirituality, there is also the concept of religion: the specific ways in which we worship or view God. Sometimes it may seem that science and religion are incompatible, or are less compatible than science and spirituality. However, the domains of each are largely separate. To the extent that they overlap, it is worth exploring how each can benefit the other. For example, can science or medicine instruct us as to how to safely heal spiritual injuries? Or can religious traditions and rituals point us to some fundamental biological truth or natural observation? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/sunday/science-religion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perhaps so</a>.</p>
<p>I have actually experienced the healing of a spiritual injury in myself by someone with a scientific background. It had not been an experience I was expecting, nor one that I had even considered possible. But it happened and was a remarkable experience that felt very intense and difficult to describe to most people. After it happened, I felt quite strongly that something about my spiritual state had been altered. I have often contemplated the scientific basis for the sensations and feelings that occurred in me during this healing process. I do believe there are some, although I am unsure whether it is wise and necessary to delve far into the intricate details of my brain state, or whether that endeavor would be akin to chasing the biological basis for free will.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I am becoming aware of just how little I discuss anything religious or spiritual. I feel that it is an awkward conversation to have, mostly because I assume everyone rushes to judgment about a religious speaker, as I do sometimes. I think the problem is also because I am out of practice discussing religion and spirituality. It is not a conversation that I hear or participate in often. I find myself hesitant to bring it up, not knowing where other people stand. And I feel uncomfortable to bring up a topic that almost no one else in my current environment discusses.</p>
<p>It would be easy – and wrong – to pin my dilemma on my STEM community. This topic has been difficult for me to discuss even among members of my church community, people with whom I supposedly share a similar worldview, spiritual outlook, and religious foundation. In an article noting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/sunday/talk-god-sprituality-christian.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the difficulty of talking about God</a> in this modern and busy world, author Jonathan Merritt observed that the decline in our spiritual vocabulary and proficiency has real consequences for the spiritual life of the community. Those consequences are negative and undesirable for the community, whether or not you believe in spiritual power or religion. And so, out of respect for the humanity and potential of our communities, I believe it is worth exploring how we can include a vocabulary of spirituality and religion in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/vocation-college-higher-ed.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academia generally and STEM fields specifically</a>.</p>

<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum</h4>
<p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in a better way.</p>
<p>Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right" id="attachment_5698" style="width: 310px;"><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5698" height="350" src="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Sensory enhancement is encoded in the presynaptic activity level of Climbing Fibers.</strong> Comparison of the sensory enhancement of calcium event amplitudes in Climbing Fibers compared to observations in Purkinje cells, measured in separate experiments. The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.</p></div>
<p>“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”</p>
<p>To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.</p>
<p>“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.</p>
<p>Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.</p>
<p>“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing fiber is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “</p>
<p>“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”</p>

<p>Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.</p>
<h4>Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?</h4>
<p>I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.</p>
<h4>How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?</h4>
<p>Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.</p>
<h4>What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?</h4>
<p>My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?</h4>
<p>I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>Often times in academia, there is a tendency to branch out on more and more tangents. This can be a good thing, in terms of intellectual freedom, boundless creativity, fresh material for the continual grant application. However, it also seems to be a way of escaping accountability, of rendering academic research one giant project in busywork.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of research if not to apply it (eventually)? Sometimes it is just fun to be curious and learn something that may someday be useful or is perhaps just interesting or fun to observe. But there are also many fields in which aimlessness is celebrated or encouraged. That is one of the beautiful parts of science, which can also allow for exciting discoveries to be made that later turn out to have highly significant effects. There are also fields in which abstraction or unapplicable revelations can stand on their own and are celebrated or mined for value: mathematics, philosophy, other arts and humanities are just as capable of producing this type of academic output.</p>
<p>If we get rather granular about the output of our field of research, the beauty and futility of it can become apparent and even coexist together. I had such an experience while working on my PhD project, a detailed computer model of a small part of the brain involved with memory. I wanted to base my model on the biology of the network as best I could. There were quite a few articles already published by anatomists, detailing the intricate studies done to count the numbers and types of neurons (brain cells) in that part of the brain. Those same scientists had also done meticulous work dying brain cells and characterizing their exact shape, size, and numbers of contacts with nearby cells. After sorting through all this published experimental data, which had taken years and years of work by dozens or hundreds of (mostly Hungarian) anatomists, I had a thought: what are we actually doing with this data? I wanted to use it to build a biologically realistic computer model, but might someone else want to use the data as well?</p>
<p>And if someone else wanted the data too, might it be worthwhile to somehow collate the data into a usable format that incorporates as much similar data as possible into a single product that can be used for reference?</p>
<p>I ended up doing just that, in a project that I now refer to as the <a href="https://www.sporadicsynapse.com/scientific-projects/quantitative-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative assessment</a>. This project then was able to form the basis for my larger research product, the detailed model and its resulting simulations. However, I also like the quantitative assessment on its own. I like how it makes use of the published literature, how it highlights and makes accessible a large body of mildly neglected facts that were gathered over years and years.</p>
<p>Much of the work in the published literature seems to lie around untouched, gathering dust, so I am always excited to hear about applications, databases, large review-type projects, and other methods to integrate or apply published data. Without such initiatives, we risk turning academia and especially science into a closed-loop system that is inaccessible to the broader public and to human-relevant progress and clinical applications.</p>
<p>With those concerns in mind, I was excited to stumble across a relatively new initiative by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that seeks to make use of the large body of published literature in the service of human health. The NIH’s <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dtr/adult-psychopathology-and-psychosocial-interventions-research-branch/computational-psychiatry-program.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computational Psychiatry</a> research funding initiative respects the significant amount of data available about psychiatric conditions and treatments, and it encourages scientists to apply algorithms to those information resources to multiple or exponentially increase their diagnostic and clinical value. It’s an example of a novel emphasis on existing literature that has a direct benefit to humankind in a relatively short time frame. In short, it’s an effective way of capitalizing on a large body of work already done, a smaller extra investment of time that can amplify the impact of the time already spent building the literature foundation for psychiatric conditions and treatments.</p>
<p>Our understanding of psychiatric conditions has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/preventing-mental-illness.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more sophisticated</a> and respectful of the whole person, with the advent of concepts such as formulation (instead of diagnosis) and the greater appreciation for contribution of a person’s life experience to the state of their brain and mind. The new emphasis on computational psychiatry complements this growing interest while also harnessing the power of our expanding computational infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he presents results from his Ph.D. research on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that the brain retains its capacity to form and remove whole synapses in adulthood.
This type of plasticity, termed structural plasticity, is capable of altering connectivity, and therefore function, of neuronal networks of the brain over periods of days and months.
Although reports of disruptive effects of structural plasticity remain scarce, a number of lesion experiments have described the time course of synaptic structures during network reorganisation by homeostatic structural plasticity in great detail.
The underlying mechanisms that drive these changes, however, are yet to be explained.
To investigate the dynamics of synaptic structures reported in these lesion studies, we replicated a peripheral lesion in a biologically plausible spiking network model that exhibits cortical asynchronous irregular firing.
Here, we present results from our computational modelling study.</p>
<p>Results from our simulations suggest that for activity to be restored to deprived neurons in the lesion projection zone (LPZ), excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic structures must exhibit opposite activity dependent growth behaviours.
Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they contribute to the maintenance of optimal activity levels in individual neurons.
Where a reduction in neuronal activity results in the sprouting of new excitatory post-synaptic structures, it is accompanied by the retraction of their inhibitory counterparts.
Extra activity is similarly countered by a retraction of excitatory post-synaptic structures and sprouting of inhibitory ones.
Our simulations also reproduce the ingrowth of excitatory axons into, and the outgrowth of inhibitory axons out from the LPZ that have been observed in lesion experiments.
We find that the ingrowth of excitatory axons requires that sprouting of excitatory pre-synaptic structures be stimulated by extra excitatory neuron activity.
The outgrowth of inhibitory axons, on the other hand, necessitates the sprouting of inhibitory pre-synaptic structures to be prompted by a loss in inhibitory neuron activity.
In conclusion, by modelling repair following deafferentation that is faithful to experimental findings, we make testable predictions on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>

<p>One debate about college environments that keeps coming up is that of free speech versus safe spaces, how to balance the basic expectation of civility and respect that students have when they attend university  with the need to be pushed out of our safe spaces to produce the growth and education that universities are called to give students.</p>
<p>Not being a minority in any sense of the word, I’m not going to attempt to tackle in this post how we could balance our duty to provide underrepresented students the same level of stability and basic comfort and respect that the rest of us already expect when we move throughout our campus communities. But what I do want to talk about today is what we can do after someone’s comfort zone has been breached.</p>
<p>Because we know it’s going to happen. And it will happen for all of us at some point during our college careers, hopefully more than just once. Those times of discomfort are necessary for growth, if we know how to care for them and use them to our benefit when they arise. So, I think the focus of the discussion about safe spaces and triggers can be shifted slightly to make the discussion more fruitful.</p>
<p>What I would discuss instead is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we identify when someone is experiencing one of these, or recognize when we ourselves are in one of these events?</li>
<li>How can we turn one of these events into an opportunity for constructive growth, meaning furthering education about the world or acquiring greater self knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first goal involves being aware of the internal feelings and assumptions of ourselves and others. This means being able to tolerate, to some extent, the discomfort of bodily feelings. It also means being proficient at reading other people and having some knowledge of their goals, values, and assumptions prior to the event. It requires a certain level of confidence and a sense of self and knowledge of the ability to tolerate extreme and unanticipated stress.</p>
<p>The second goal requires a knowledge of the resources available to us and others. This may include counselors and other therapeutic healing practices, as well as various forms of communication.</p>
<p>We also need to determine what is an appropriate level of discomfort or trigger. This is where things get very controversial. In general, at the college level especially, there is no one appropriate level of intellectual offense beyond which a line has been crossed, as long as we’re discussing communicating ideas  via legal and appropriate means such as via text books, civil discussion and lectures, movies, homework and class projects.</p>
<p>The usefulness of a lesson is lost if it traumatizes the student. Responsible faculty would try to reduce this risk by avoiding lessons or modes of communication that they reasonably expect to be traumatic to their students.</p>
<p>But since we often don’t know the personal history, original culture, and life experiences of the people around us, we can’t be assured of whether something is experienced by them as traumatic or not. I had a horrible experience at a seminar in college where we watched a graphic movie. We had been told ahead of time that we would be watching a movie about a violent rape and double murder and that the movie would be exploring the theme of forgiveness in what seems like an impossible situation. The seminar was not required, but I went anyway because I have often wondered about the concept of forgiveness, something that I struggle with myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Anyway, we watched the movie, and it was way more traumatic than I expected. I couldn’t complain, because I found myself just being grateful that I wasn’t the person being depicted on screen. To me, the violence looked real. My physiological system couldn’t differentiate between seeing the event through the TV screen versus in real life, and it felt horrible to sit there watching people’s lives end brutally. It was so triggering for me that I couldn’t comprehend what the movie was trying to teach me about forgiveness. I didn’t get a debrief afterward either, so I was just haunted by what I had witnessed without any real growth from it. I also felt creeped out that no one around me seemed to be reacting as strongly as I was to seeing something so terrifying.</p>
<p>I reasoned that I shouldn’t complain about not being given sufficient warning before seeing something so horrible, because the people who it happened to in real life hadn’t been warned either. But the ostensible point of the film was not to traumatize its viewers. And the forum in which we were watching it was not supposed to do that either, it was supposed to get us thinking about the concept of forgiveness. I left the seminar in a state of mild shock and with no further understanding of forgiveness, such as the difference between transactional forgiveness and a state forgiveness. For me, that movie and that lesson failed.</p>
<p>And that is an example of a potential learning opportunity gone horribly wrong. Ideally, the seminar could have included a discussion of how we were feeling after having watched something so awful and an overview of the resources available to us to recover from it. We could have also had a meatier discussion about types and instances of forgiveness in our own lives or in the lives of famous historical figures, with several different viewpoints and situations being introduced to us to broaden our minds.</p>
<p>I eventually discovered or was introduced to the writings of folks such as Martin Luther King Jr, Thich Nhat Hanh, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and more. I learned about the shades of different emotions and spiritual states by reading Martha Nussbaum. But it took me years to do this, years during which I could have benefited from already having that spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these opportunities of difficulty and discomfort that faculty may seek out for their students and that students ideally learn to seek out for themselves are not in themselves wrong or politically distasteful. It is more that they are only responsible, they are only civil and respectful of people with diverse backgrounds and underrepresented students, if we make sure to debrief and heal anyone who has been traumatized afterward, and if we continue the discussion until we have heard and debated the diverse perspectives of the other participants. Notably, this means that we may need to iterate between healing and further discussions, because students who were traumatized by the original lecture or seminar content are not in a position to then continue the discussion. If we don’t allow for healing followed by further discussions, then the “learning experience” becomes just an excuse to further traumatize already disadvantaged members of the student population.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9875">Independent Discussion Sections?</a></h4>

Scientific papers should have two Discussion sections - one written by the authors, and the other by an independent researcher.

According to a new paper from Michael S. Avidan, John P. A. Ioannidis and George A. Mashour, this "second discussant" system could help ensure more balanced and objective inference in science.



The authors begin by noting that while the reproducibility crisis has focussed attention on the Methods and Results sections of papers, Discussion sections are not free

<p>Edward Wakelam's journal club session, where he will present his work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student’s likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those at risk of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, though data mining and machine learning approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. Ed describes an experiment conducted on a final year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data is limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. Ed found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially at risk.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/599785588/0/oupblogpsychology/">Warning: music therapy comes with risks</a></h4>

<p>Bob <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://genius.com/The-wailers-trenchtown-rock-lyrics">Marley sings</a>, “One good thing about music—when it hits you, you feel no pain.” Although this may be the case for some people and in some circumstances, we dispute this statement as a global truth. After all, couldn’t any phenomenon commanding enough to alleviate human pain (ostensibly instantaneously) also harbor the potential to catalyze undesirable, even injurious, effects? And couldn’t this influence then logically extend to music employed within the context of a therapeutic process? As music therapist and Concordia University Associate Professor <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/02/challenging-assumptions-how-music-helps/">Dr. Laurel Young writes,</a> “the ‘miraculous’ effects of music as featured in popular media along with the widely accepted notion that music is a ‘universal’ medium can lead to false generalizations and over-simplification of how music can and should be used in healthcare or other psychosocial contexts.” One possible manifestation of this oversimplification is to view music as a noninvasive and wholly-positive cure-all, and thus disregard the potential risks associated with music engagement.</p><p>All therapeutic encounters carry possible risks. In fact, a certain level of risk-taking is necessary for any significant and enduring change to occur. And so, all therapists need a detailed understanding of relevant risks in order to discern the optimal risk-benefit ratio for the people who enlist their services.</p><p>The potential risks of music therapy vary according to the type of music experience, or <em>method</em>, employed. Depending on clients’ needs, they may be invited to improvise, perform, compose, or listen and respond to music. Music therapists must not only understand the inherent benefits of these various methods, but also the unique risks associated with each.</p><p><em>Improvising</em> is making up music on the spot. Whereas improvising on percussion instruments in a group session may promote a sense of cohesion among adults seeking mental health treatment, for people whose connection with reality is tenuous, repetitive rhythmic sounds hold the potential to evoke psychotic reactions. And, while improvising with their voices, clients may experience various levels of emotionally-charged self-consciousness. Beyond embarrassment from using their voices and words in this expository way, the experience may evoke long-buried, unconscious memories and associations of an unpleasant or even traumatizing nature.</p><div><figure><img height="300" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dv1otOSyQwM-1-744x496.jpg" width="450" /><em>Image credit: “three persons playing sundry instruments at home” by Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz.

However, they may also experience intense anxiety, dissatisfaction, and humiliation if the musical parts do not fit together as anticipated during the school assembly.</p><p>As an abused teen works with a therapist while <em>composing</em> an original song or instrumental piece, the energies brought to bear through musical tensions and resolutions, or the moods evoked by the sonic qualities of certain instruments, may be incongruous with the client’s lyrics. This may distort rather than clarify the client’s inner experiences, which could complicate the therapeutic process.</p><p>Finally, risks inherent to a music <em>listening</em> experience may include overstimulation and confusion. This would be a relevant consideration for a person who has sustained a brain injury or who has a neurologic disorder that impacts their ability to make meaning of sensory input. And, while a listener takes in music to guide their movement schemes, as when dancing for self-expression or the release of stress, there is always the risk of physical injury.</p><p>A primary responsibility of the music therapist is to intentionally design and facilitate all four methods and their innumerable variations to support clients as they face life’s trials, identify new options for acting, and build on personal and collective capacities toward enhanced health and wellbeing. Additionally, it is the therapist’s ethical duty to consider carefully the possible risks intrinsic to each type of music experience and to share this knowledge with the client as appropriate, with the ultimate aim of protecting their safety and promoting their agency in the therapeutic process.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “a group of musical instruments including a guitar, drum, and keyboard” by Brian Goodman.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/599743166/0/oupblogpsychology/">Theranos and the cult of personality in science and tech</a></h4>

<p>Elizabeth Holmes was a chemical engineering student who dropped out of Stanford to found Theranos: a silicon-valley start-up company that, at one point, was valued at US$9 billion. Her plan was to be another Steve Jobs and, for a while, it looked like that would happen. She made the cover of magazines like <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Fortune</em>, and even <em>Glamour</em>, wearing black polo-neck shirts and was touted as being the next big thing. Former President Clinton was a fan. Former Secretary-of-State George Schultz was an investor and on the Theranos board as were Henry Kissinger and James (Mad Dog) Mattis who stepped down as Secretary of Defense last year.</p><p>Today, she is facing fraud and other criminal charges.</p><p>It’s a long, fascinating story. Essentially, her technology was supposed to revolutionise health care: automatically performing hundreds of blood tests on a couple of drops of blood in just a few minutes. In reality, it was no more carefully thought out than an undergraduate research project. She lied to her staff, lied to her investors, lied to her board, and lied to her company’s potential customers. Her company claimed it was using new technology to perform blood tests when, in fact, it was using the same equipment as every other lab (except Theranos got poorer results because they did not have enough blood to do the tests properly).</p><p>All this is detailed in the book <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549478/bad-blood-by-john-carreyrou/9781524731656/"><em><strong>Bad Blood</strong></em></a> by John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal investigative reporter who broke the story with the help of whistle-blowers.</p><p>What fascinates me about this saga is how the scam was able to go on for so long: more than 10 years. In that time there was an incredible rate of staff turnover (including one suicide), endless lawsuits, countless missed deadlines, and a seeming inability to finish any serious studies that demonstrated the technology worked. At one stage, Holmes was even asked to step down by members of her board but managed to talk them out of it.</p><p>The cult of personality that grew up around Elizabeth Holmes accounts for both her success and failure. By all accounts she is an incredibly magnetic person and – at least to begin with – most people found her an inspiring leader and visionary. This is what made it possible to raise millions of dollars, get such prominent people on her board, and attract a lot of incredibly talented people to work with and for her.</p><p>Steve Jobs, of course, was famous for a similar kind of charisma and bullying (also an issue at Theranos), so perhaps it’s not surprising that the ‘reality-distortion field’ associated with him was present here too. But, of course, Steve Jobs wasn’t alone. He had Steve Wozniak, the technical brains that made Apple possible. Jobs could play the visionary, safe in the knowledge that Woz (and others that followed) would look after the details.</p><p>Elizabeth didn’t have that: in fact, the cult of personality built up around her made it impossible for her <em>Woz</em> to emerge.</p><div><blockquote><p>Experts don’t like being undervalued, so the naysayers start to leave and the yes-men take their places.</p></blockquote></div><p>Where there is a Great Leader figure – in business, politics, tech, academia – who doesn’t have the personality or maturity to use their power wisely, there is often a predictable downward spiral. First, our hero starts to believe that their initial success comes from extraordinary talent, and that despite their lack of education or training or experience (or all of the above) they are the only ones capable of realising their vision. This strips away any humility they might have had. Even if they have a lot of great people around them, their belief in their own exceptionalism leads them to start overruling those who disagree based on instinct rather than expertise.</p><p>Experts don’t like being undervalued, so the naysayers start to leave and the yes-men take their places. They tell the boss what the boss wants to hear, true or not. This makes those left who are willing to speak out seem even more whiney in contrast, making the ‘great leader’ paranoid. Now, <em>loyalty </em>is the ultimate virtue: not to the original idea or mission of the company, but to the leader. Being a team player starts being equated with doing what you’re told. Because performance now comes second to obedience, mediocrity thrives. There is no voice for excellence. Ironically, of course, the people with the most integrity and genuine passion for the project are the most likely to leave, leaving the opportunists behind.</p><p>This paranoia also cultivates a culture of secrecy and centralisation, where the left hand is prevented from knowing what the right is doing for fear that they may conspire. People are discouraged from asking questions and start to hear the answer, “Because I said so.” This lack of transparency leads to poor communication, misunderstanding of problems, and inefficiency. Since staff have no agency, many feel absolved of personal responsibility. When asked to behave unethically, they feel they have no choice. This is a road not just to failure, but disaster.</p><p>We need to stop looking for the next great leader and focus on looking for great ideas. We will figure out which will succeed and which will fail not through being charmed, or going with our gut, or believing in the latest genius, but by asking intelligent and probing questions and teaming up with people who are working hard to find answers. Yes, it’s easier to sit back passively and ride on some great leader’s coat tails. If you do, however, don’t count on reaching the destination you had in mind.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: ““828584” by Free-Photos.

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9868">Are Atheists Genetically Damaged?</a></h4>

I just came across a paper with an interesting title: The Mutant Says in His Heart, “There Is No God”.

The conclusions of this work are even more interesting. According to the authors, Edward Dutton et al., humans evolved to be religious and atheism is caused (in part) by mutational damage to our normal, religious DNA. Atheists, in other words, are genetic degenerates.





Despite the talk of mutations, there is no genetics in this paper. No atheist genomes were sequenced and found to

<p>After reading this amazing story of a neuroscience professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who is speaking out about harassment in science and other STEM fields, I realized just how little I’ve spoken up about harassment that I have witnessed or received as a female scientist and engineer. Thank you for modeling the actions of responsible scientists, Professor <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/neuroscientist-fighting-sexual-harassment-science-her-own-job-peril" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BethAnn McLaughlin</a>.</p>
<p>What I most value about her work, from my brief glimpse provided by Science Magazine, is that Professor McLaughlin holds harassers accountable for their detriment to science. Her key point: harassers are not just destroying others’ careers and spirits, they are sabotaging their research fields. Now funding agencies are taking notice, such as the National Institutes of Health (<a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/11/09/new-application-requirements-for-institutional-training-grants-letter-of-institutional-commitment-to-harassment-and-discrimination-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIH</a>) and National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/odi/harassment.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NSF</a>), two of the largest funding agencies of biological sciences research in academia. The NIH and NSF are defining their expectations that grant funds (taxpayer dollars) not be used to pay for the time and space it takes to house a harasser within groping distance of other researchers and academics.</p>
<p>Setting standards as the NIH and NSF have done is important, but it’s not enough. As a tax-paying U.S. citizen, I want the expectations of the funding organizations to be even higher for the institutions receiving those funds. Research institutions and universities must set, communicate, and maintain clear standards of behavior for all roles defined by the institution, so that it’s clear to all members of the group what the mission of the group is and how each role works together to fulfill the mission.</p>
<p>Of the various science and engineering experiences I have had so far in my career, I’ve met a lot of people passionate about their field of study. I have also met a lot of people who are hard workers. These two traits often overlap, but not always. I once had a boss who was quite passionate about his field of study but was a lousy member of the academic community. That experience cost me too much in time, mental health, career prospects, and productivity. What I learned scientifically and professionally during that time was not worth the heartache associated with working in an abusive environment.</p>
<p>This experience happened while I was an undergraduate student at another university. I had wanted to spend a summer in a different state, so I applied to an NSF-funded program hosted by a large university and was excited when I found out I was accepted and had been assigned to a specific lab. But as the summer got closer, I began to feel a little uncomfortable that the program wasn’t better organized. It wasn’t always clear who was in charge and what administrative support would be available to us as we joined our new labs and made our way through an unknown university system.</p>
<p>When I finally got there and made my way to the advisor’s office for my assigned lab, I was confused to discover that I would actually be reporting to someone else I didn’t know at all, a postdoc in the same lab. I didn’t know any better and was complacent as the advisor escorted me to this new, de facto boss who was an immigrant from another country with strong cultural differences compared to the general culture of the United States. There was a mismatch of expectations between myself and my de facto boss that made the program a horrible experience for me. I thought I was signing onto a 10-week long intensive research-and-writing program; he thought he was getting an indentured servant for 7 years.</p>
<p>The lab seemed normal at first, except for the unexpected arrangement of reporting to this random postdoc rather than the listed advisor for the lab. I wasn’t yet used to how hierarchical the academic environment can be; my regular research experience at my undergraduate institution was professional and involved being in regular contact with the direct advisor of the lab. At this internship, however, I found myself alternating between working at a desk station set up for me in the main lab and the postdoc’s office, which was on another floor and only shared with one officemate who was hardly in the office.</p>
<p>The postdoc started isolating me almost immediately, though I didn’t realize it at first. He dismissed the undergraduate journal article which was supposed to be my main deliverable at the end of the program and my main project throughout the program. He directed me to work on his manuscript instead, saying that we could quickly write a trimmed-down version at the end of the 10 weeks to satisfy the requirement for my own program.</p>
<p>At first I didn’t think much of his priority realignment. I went about my day dutifully, learning the scientific and design concepts behind the engineering project. I read journal articles, learned a new software system, designed engineering devices, and carried out experiments. Sometimes the postdoc would mentor me or be friendly. But other times he would just watch me work, or grab another student and stand behind me together, watching and talking about me in another language as if I were a zoo animal.</p>
<p>About 6 weeks into the program, I began to get pretty nervous about my paper, having spent all my time on my boss’s manuscript. He noticed my anxiety and asked me to talk to him in his office. But when I got there, he started holding my hand and laughing at me when I told him to stop or tried to remove it. He escalated his behavior, groping my chest, blocking my exit out the door when I tried to leave or escape, and assailing me like an octopus with slimy tentacles when I tried to continue my work. I felt disgusted and violated. I also felt trapped, wondering how I could make him stop.</p>
<p>He would laugh sadistically at my distress and tears, ignore me when I told him to stop touching me, and make fun of me when I got mad at his abuse. I started avoiding his office, preferring the safety of the communal lab environment downstairs. But he followed me down there, sitting near me and making creepy sexual references as I tried to concentrate on my work. He was unconcerned with my dissent and lack of interest in him. I felt terrified that words like “no,” “stop,” or “leave me alone” meant nothing to him. He would get mad at me for not initiating my own abuse, or for insisting on working in the main lab, or for crying. The strength of his internal delusions became clear after awhile, as he insisted that he would “never hurt me” while watching me cry, or when he said sadistically, “I don’t think you would ever report me to anyone.” He had no concept of me as a separate human being with a voice that mattered, a person who had joined a lab to do scientific research. It was extremely frustrating and I didn’t know how to make it stop, since talking to him and telling him to stop wasn’t working. Eventually I stopped putting up a fight and telling him “no,” because it wasn’t working and it was too scary for me to continue acknowledging that my words meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>I did end up reporting him to the police years later, as well as to his wife. But what I really needed and didn’t have during that 10 week summer program was knowledge of the resources available at that school to people like me. I wasn’t a regular undergraduate student there and so I didn’t know whether the services of the university were available to someone like me. I also wasn’t sure who to talk to or how my situation would be dealt with. I was scared that all the hard work I had put into his manuscript for the past several weeks would be lost, that I would get kicked out of the lab with nothing to show for all my time, effort, and competence. The program I had joined hadn’t explained what campus resources were available to us, nor how to deal with sexual harassment and assault.</p>
<p>Nor did it cover how to deal with a boss who is emotionally abusive, independent of sexual harassment. My boss would regularly make me feel guilty about not taking time off my education or career to help care for my ailing grandpa (who was already being cared for). He invited me to his family’s apartment for dinner and then badgered me every day after to let him come see the dorms where the students from our program were housed, telling me I was a really inhospitable person to come to dinner at his apartment and then not let him visit mine. He kept talking inappropriately even when he wasn’t guilt-tripping me. It happened mostly in his office but even in the communal lab. He made all sorts of disgusting comments about his sex life with his wife, graphic things that made me worry he had raped her or that he was a pedophile (or both). He was unconcerned by my discomfort and would keep criticizing my boundaries and perspective, telling me “you think you’re always right,” as if he couldn’t quite grasp that I was the authority and guard of my own body.</p>
<p>I finished the program but felt horrible afterward. I went back to my undergraduate university in a state of deep depression and humiliation, and I started losing weight. He kept calling me, requesting more help with his manuscript. I ended up writing most of the manuscript. I had expected he would edit it and make it more professional, but when it got published, I was surprised to see that it contained mostly my wording – he hadn’t done much on it at all. Even worse, the figures he had complained so righteously about remained in the final publication.</p>
<p>While conducting experiments, I had needed a high-precision ruler and he had refused to order one. In a time crunch, I resorted to printing a ruler scale on the lab printer and using it to track distances in the experiment. The precision of the ruler was obviously somewhat low given that I used a standard-issue printer, but it was high enough to provide suitable accuracy for observing the scale of movement present in the experiment. I kept hoping that he would break down and order the ruler from whatever lab supply site he generally used, but he insisted on sitting around and complaining about me instead, so the final publication featured photographs in which the paper ruler was prominent.</p>
<p>Even after I stopped working in that lab, he would continue to contact me and request that I continue writing the paper, even though I had just worked in the lab as an undergraduate without much formal training. He kept contacting me for almost three years after I left the lab, each time badgering me with requests and long diatribes about his feelings that made me feel guilty and ashamed for wanting to move on with my life and maintain my boundaries. It took me years of therapy to regain my sense of self and the sense of safety required for me to be capable of expressing emotions.</p>
<p>Years later, I can look back and take stock of the situation I was placed in by deciding to participate in a federally-funded program that did not have adequate administrative oversight. My experience damaged my ability to contribute to the field of science and my trust in academia. It dissuaded me from following my intended trajectory after university. And it would have been far less likely to happen had the program made its expectations clearer for all participants: students, advisors, mentors, and administrators.</p>
<p>Inspired by the #MeToo movement, I recently decided to give feedback both to the program and to the funding organization. I think this is what will ultimately help us move through the #MeToo pipeline constructively: giving feedback to organizations and funders is the next step in shining light on the structural issues inherent in academia and STEM that allow abuse to flourish in those environments. Once the structural issues are exposed, the responsible parties can work to hold themselves accountable and create a stronger foundation to allow us to pursue what we are ultimately there for, be it STEM, academia generally, or some other calling.</p>

<p>Olga Tveretina's journal club session, where she will present herself and Andrei Sandler's work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A hybrid system is a dynamic system that exhibits both continuous and discrete behaviour, and the number of its dimensions is determined by the number of the continuous variables. The hybrid system paradigm is a useful tool for describing a wide range of real-world applications. Examples come from robotics, avionics, biological networks, chemical processes, etc. Most of the hybrid systems are safety critical. Formally, verifying safety properties of hybrid systems consists of construction of a set of reachable states and checking whether this set intersects with a set of unsafe states. Therefore, one of the most fundamental problems in the analysis of hybrid systems is the reachability problem. The reachability problem is known for being difficult, and it is only decidable for special kinds of hybrid systems. Even though many attempts have been made to define the boundary between decidable and undecidable hybrid systems, it is far from being resolved. Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider defined some classes of low dimensional hybrid systems lying on the boundary between decidable and undecidable systems in their seminal paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0890540112000028/1-s2.0-S0890540112000028-main.pdf?_tid=9f466a86-e73b-4b4c-9dd9-84ef605373a7&amp;acdnat=1552504249_aa972217ec2e75d11dcc518467361ca5">Low dimensional hybrid systems – decidable, undecidable, don’t know (Asarin et al., 2012)</a>", and for which decidability is unknown. In this talk, Olga will present an overview of the area and discuss the recent work on the decidability of reachability for a class of hybrid systems due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider.</p>

<p>Last post we discussed creating a personal support system as part of a broader success framework to provide students structure when they leave home for the first time. Today we’ll finish the discussion with a quick note about administrative resources commonly available at schools.</p>
<h4>Administrative Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ombudsman or campus-level resources
<ul>
<li>First, find the contact info for your school’s ombudsman and plug it into your phone. If your school doesn’t have an ombudsman, seek out an administrative official or faculty mentor who would be willing to answer any questions you have about the school’s resources. Ombudsmen are a useful starting point for almost any problem you may have in a university context, because they provide free, flexible, and confidential support and can direct you to the most appropriate campus resource for solving any problem you may have. They can also aid you in figuring out how to provide feedback to other campus departments and resources if they fail to meet your needs.</li>
<li>If you find yourself needing to use administrative resources, make sure to document your interactions with them and continue the interaction until you are satisfied that your concern has been understood, even if it means having to give feedback to the administrative resource about your dissatisfaction with their service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentors
<ul>
<li>Join a peer mentorship program associated with your major, department, intended profession, or identity. A program that provides occasional events for you and your mentor to interact is great.</li>
<li>You and your mentor should also plan to meet about once a month to make sure you build the supportive relationship necessary to maintain the mentorship dynamic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Giving feedback
<ul>
<li>For any of the resources made available by your university or its health center, feel empowered to initiate a discussion or provide feedback if the resource is not helping you as you had hoped.</li>
<li>If you are unsure where to direct feedback, the ombudsman or faculty member should be able to suggest the appropriate venue. It’s important to let the administrative resources know what works or doesn’t work for you, since they exist for that purpose. They may also be able to suggest alternative supports or resources that can better assist you. Those types of conversations will also help you develop your sense of responsibility, self, and accountability because you will gain a better understanding of what is under your control and what expectations are reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being prepared for crises
<ul>
<li>Make sure to have the following numbers programmed into your cell phone in case you need them:
<ul>
<li>Campus police or the nearest off-campus police station</li>
<li>Rape crisis center on or near campus</li>
<li>Counseling center</li>
<li>Student health center or your primary care doctor</li>
<li>Suicide prevention hotline</li>
<li>Domestic violence hotline</li>
<li>Poison Control hotline</li>
<li>Any other numbers listed on the back of your student ID card</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most important – don’t be afraid to call these numbers. That’s what they’re there for!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>These are just a few ideas for making use of the administrative resources at your school. What other ideas do you have?</p>

"Foreign Accent Syndrome" (FAS) is a rare disorder in which patients start to speak with a foreign or regional tone. This striking condition is often associated with brain damage, such as stroke. Presumably, the lesion affects the neural pathways by which the brain controls the tongue and vocal cords, thus producing a strange sounding speech.



Yet there may be more to FAS than meets the eye (or ear). According to a new paper  in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, many o

<p>Last post we discussed the importance of creating a personal success framework after you leave home. The idea of this framework is that it can serve as a structure to help you transition from being a child of your parents to being a grown adult with your own internal value and support structure. This post, we’ll explore some options for creating a personal support system to hold you accountable for the values and organizations to which you aspire.</p>
<p>Although this project is really meant for everyone who eventually leaves their parents’ house, here I am focusing specifically on students attending university for the first time. Over your first semester or first two quarters of university, you may wish to take some or all of these steps to create the system you need to weather the stress of university and to grow into the adult you want to become. By creating your support system, you can reduce the risk of having to experience one of the situations associated with the negative statements above and increase the likelihood of having a positive, constructive college experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Personal Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Professional counseling
<ul>
<li>First, find the right counselor. When you first get to college, and hopefully before you need it, make an appointment with a licensed counselor at your school’s health or counseling center. Most schools have these resources and make them available for free or a low cost to students. Make an appointment and discuss your goals or whatever is on your mind. While there, figure out if you feel comfortable with this counselor and would find them helpful to navigate a difficult time in your life. If not, schedule another appointment at a later date with a different counselor until you find one you can get along with.</li>
<li>Stay in touch with that counselor. Try to schedule an appointment with the counselor at least once a semester or quarter. That way you can maintain your relationship with them and they can get a baseline idea of your personality.</li>
<li>Reach out to the counselor during any crisis situation. Make an appointment with the counselor as soon as you safely can after experiencing any type of crisis (social, medical, emotional) to debrief and figure out if there are any more steps you may wish to take for your own benefit or recovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Friend group
<ul>
<li>Make friends across a variety of common interests, values, or activities. This will usually happen organically for students in college, so if it doesn’t happen for you in a reasonable time period, consider discussing that with a counselor.</li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one friend in each friend group who you are comfortable discussing difficult personal topics with. If you don’t have a friend of that closeness in one of your groups, consider whether you want to remain in that activity or group.</li>
<li>Consider joining or creating a peer support group, either through an established program in your college or as part of a spiritual or religious group or as an informal group of people working towards a shared group goal or tackling a common personal goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your community of origin
<ul>
<li>Find an older university student who also attended your high school and meet with them at least once during your freshman year to get their take on how the culture of your high school and college differ</li>
<li>Stay in regular contact with a role model, teacher, coach, or other positive influence from your home community, at least until you have developed a robust social support network at your university.</li>
<li>Intentionally set video chat or phone dates to stay in contact with your closest high school friends while away at university so that the friendships don’t settle into a texting-only dynamic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your self
<ul>
<li>Writing is a good way to make use of your own internal resources and to create resources for yourself in the event of a crisis. You may wish to keep a private journal (online or pen-and-ink) or a blog that is public or accessible to certain people or groups</li>
<li>Using a journal you can write about current events, your own life and feelings, and how you solve problems that come up for you</li>
<li>It is also a good idea to document problem events or incidents that occur in your life, whether you choose to do anything else about them or not (any stalking, harassment, discrimination, or bullying by other students, faculty, or others)</li>
<li>If you later realize that you have become disconnected from yourself, unduly influenced by peers or groups with values that are incompatible to yours, or if you need to recover your sense of self after a traumatic event, rereading your previous journal entries may help you. In the best case scenario, you’ll end up with a record of your social activities that can later be enjoyable to look back on and see how you spent your time having fun in college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Community Resources</h4>
<ol>
<li>Your new community
<ul>
<li>Consider joining a spiritual, religious, or club focused on personal growth</li>
<li>Be mindful of the size of your major and department – smaller departments can provide a family-like experience but your experience is also much more dependent on the individual personalities of the peers in your department, making it more important for you to seek strong faculty mentorship and support. Larger departments afford more opportunities to build a selective peer network and more variability in the composition of the required classes you must take.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next post, we’ll list ideas for finding and using the administrative resources available to you at your university. What other ideas do you have for building a personal success framework?</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189524"><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></a> is the most iconic of all mental illnesses but both its conceptualization and causes remain elusive. The popular image portrays patients convinced of being persecuted and hearing voices that nobody else can hear. In reality this complex brain disorder presents an endless variety of psychotic (delusions and hallucinations) and non-psychotic symptoms. This complexity is at the heart of a century-long debate about whether schizophrenia is a single illness or should be conceptualized as a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189524"><strong>syndrome,</strong></a> like dementia, in which different illnesses present common symptoms but have different causes.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/142/1/220/5144594?redirectedFrom=fulltext"><strong>One important case to look at when considering the origins of schizophrenia is that of Vaslav Nijinsky</strong></a> (1890-1950), the most talented ballet dancer in history, who was diagnosed one hundred years ago.</p><p>His biography resembles a novel, filled with drama, anecdotes, and controversies. A child prodigy at the Imperial Russian Ballet School in St. Petersburg, he went to lead <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Serge-Pavlovich-Diaghilev"><strong>Diaghilev</strong></a>’s legendary <em>Ballet Russes</em>company that exhilarated Europe from 1909.  Nijinsky was famous for the prodigious leaps, technical perfection, elegant movements, and delicate expression of emotions as much as for his radical choreographies (<strong>figure</strong>) that opened modern dance to the general public.</p><figure><img height="675" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nijinsky_005.jpg" width="520" /><em>L’après-midi d’un faune, premiered in 1912 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The first choregraphy by Nijinsky was the first ‘dissonant’ ballet, uncoupling movements and music, generated a major controversy. Image credit: Nijinsky in “L’Après-midi d’un faune”.

For instance, as Russian national, he was under house arrest in Budapest during the First World War. A high-profile international diplomatic agreement was needed for a safe-passage, with the strict condition that Nijinsky must dance again. He was also prone to choleric outbursts and impulsive acts. Once, he threaten to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20140812/54412887019/cambo-salvador-nijinsky.html"><strong>leave the company in Barcelona</strong></a> due to financial disputes and police had to detain him at the train station and bring him back to the theatre.</p><p>In 1917, after his second dismissal from the company due to erratic behaviour, Nijinsky settled in Switzerland with his family. He continued to suffer from disruptive delusions and hallucinations, however. He described these experiences richly in his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-Diary-of-Vaslav-Nijinsky-by-Vaslaw-Nijinsky-Joan-Ross-Acocella/9780252073625"><strong>diaries</strong></a>, a masterpiece for self-reported schizophrenia symptoms, and a must-read to all psychiatrists-to-be.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eugen-Bleuler"><strong>Professor Eugen Bleuler</strong></a> and Nijinsky met on 6 March 1919. The towering figure in psychiatric history assessed the world-famous dancer at the Burghölzli, an asylum near Zurich. Bleuler concluded, “intelligence evidently very good in the past, now he is a confused schizophrenic with mild manic excitement.” Nijinsky was just 30 years old and was never to recover.</p><div><figure><img height="744" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Eugen_bleuler-493x744.jpg" width="493" /><em>Prof. Eugen Bleuler, circa 1900. Image credit: Eugen Bleuler by The National Library of Medicine.

The majority of the time he was either catatonic or displayed disorganized speech and behaviour. Some of the most renowned psychiatrists of the age—including Ludwig Binswanger, Carl Jung, Nobel Prize winner Julius Wagner-Jauregg, Alfred <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7018450"><strong>Adler</strong></a>, and Manfred <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Manfred-J-Sakel"><strong>Sakel</strong></a> —treated Nijinsky, with little success. Nijinsky had barely any symptom-free periods.  During the Second World War, Nijinsky narrowly escaped the Nazi program for eradicating patients with mental illness by hiding in a cave. He finally died of kidney failure in London at the age of 60.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62036-X/fulltext"><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></a> is currently conceptualized as a disorder in which genetic and early-in-life stressors affects the brain development (the so-called neurodevelopmental hypothesis). Subtle cognitive, social, and motor impairments act as silent markers of the disease during childhood, albeit psychosis will emerge after adolescence, when the illness is diagnosed.</p><p>Understanding Nijinsky’s case only under this neurodevelopmental prism is challenging, however. As a child he was prodigiously balanced, with formidable strength and harmonic movements. His case does not fit with the neurological soft-signs and subtle motor abnormalities that are signs of neurodevelopmental problems.  Indeed, Nijinsky’s biography is filled with tragic events, including repeated physical and sexual abuse before psychosis onset, crudely reported in his diaries. Such traumatic experiences are considered major risk factors for developing psychosis and schizophrenia. Nijinsky’s case might be an iconic case of this group of patients in which trauma is present later in life and not directly related to early neurodevelopmental factors. Unravelling the mechanisms by which trauma is associated to schizophrenia remains a challenge.</p><p>Intriguingly, Bleuler was among the first to advocate for a syndrome approach for the disorder. Dementia praecox, the old term for schizophrenia, was first proposed by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emil-Kraepelin"><strong>Emil Kraepelin</strong></a>, after grouping three independent illnesses (paranoia, catatonia and hebephrenia) into a single category or clinical entity. It was Bleuler who in 1911 coined the term schizophrenias, in plural, to highlight the likely different causes for the disorder. The attempts to differentiate schizophrenia subtypes based in clinical features have failed, however, due to poor reliability and frequent overlap between subtypes. A recent effort to deconstruct mental symptoms into their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091379?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed"><strong>cognitive domains</strong></a>, which also resembles Bleuler’s fundamental symptoms approach, is a new step in the understanding of this complex disorder or group of disorders.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Curtain” by Eli Elschi .

<p>Upon wishing my students a fruitful end to their college-application season, I thought back to that time in my own life. I began to consider what is really important for a successful college career versus what I thought would be important when I was applying to university. There are the things we assume will be key to our success: going to a prestigious school, picking a solid major with a clear career path associated with it, getting a good summer internship.</p>
<p>But there are so many unknowns, which is one of the beautiful parts of going to university. The possibilities seem endless and it’s hard to top that feeling of unlimited potential that imbues the manicured landscape of your new home when you set foot on campus for the first time.</p>
<p>But all those opportunities and unpredictability mean that you don’t really know if, a few years from now when you are lining up for commencement, you will be following your original dream or taking a different career path. You don’t know how long you will remain in your first career. Or what revelations or other life-altering experiences you may have during your college education, that could radically shift your values or priorities. Or what people or significant others you will hopefully meet.</p>
<p>All of these important and inevitable adventures aside, there is another aspect of university that we sometimes don’t consider consciously and deliberately, but that is just as important. Moving away from home is, for most of us, our first significant opportunity to be independent from our parents long enough to mature into a functioning adult.</p>
<p>Ambling through campus on any given day, the word “adult” can feel far away in time and atmosphere from college life. But it is already there on your personal horizon – the responsibility for keeping yourself healthy, the accountability to yourself and others to succeed in class and other activities. University is an opportunity to form and solidify your independent self with your own morals, values, and life outlook.</p>
<p>It is also a time when you’ll be introduced to hundreds of people with varying life outlooks, and when you will join or consort with a variety of groups and communities that have different values, social etiquette, and cultures. With all of this possibility and variability, chances are that at some point, the following will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will fall short of your own expectations in a big way</li>
<li>You will fall short of someone else’s expectations in a way that is significant to them</li>
<li>Someone else will seriously disappoint your expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>When this happens, you have an opportunity to compare your expectations, their expectations, and the stated expectations of your campus community. Questions may arise in your mind: were those expectations reasonable? Where did they come from? You can learn a lot about yourself, your culture, and your values from these experiences.</p>
<p>However, there is also the matter the unmet expectations themselves. These situations can be destabilizing, even traumatic. When they happen during your transition to adult independence, these occurrences can have an unhealthy effect on your outlook or personal growth if you don’t have the resources to process them and learn from them.</p>
<p>I had an experience where I fell far short of my own expectations, and it haunted me for years afterward. What could have been an uncomfortable opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values instead became a nuisance burden of shame that I carried about, inhibiting my own conception of myself as a competent adult.</p>
<p>The trouble began towards the end of my sophomore year. I had been serving as secretary of a student organization for the year and had put in my name to run for president of that organization the following year. It was one of those national organizations with student branches on most college campuses and it was affiliated with my major.</p>
<p>At the time I was running, the voting population of the organization was a bit ambiguous to me: was it the dues-paying members who made our activities possible, or was it the students of that major, for whom we designed and targeted our activities? If I had thought to read the bylaws of our student organization I would have found a good answer, but I didn’t. The outgoing president had a list of email addresses that he said corresponded to all the current students in the major. He would submit that list to the online election app so that all the students would have an opportunity to vote for the club’s next year of leadership, which is how the elections were usually run.</p>
<p>However, a couple weeks before he was to submit the list, he made an offhand joke about padding the list with some extra emails to sway the election because so many of the upperclassmen had a problem with the person running against me and because he felt that she had bribed the freshman class by stopping by their morning lecture with a big box of donuts. I told him not to do that and he moved onto another topic of conversation. I thought it was a joke that I had heard the end of. It wasn’t until several weeks after the election that I found out he was serious. He announced in a leadership meeting that he had padded the vote and told us not to speak of it to anyone. When I asked how many votes he had added and found out that his padding was what won me the election, I was disappointed and ashamed. I felt personally responsible that he had done such a thing and that my voice seemed not to matter.</p>
<p>But my own reaction made the situation much worse. <span>My initial reaction was to feel unworthy of respect, given that he had already intentionally disrespected my stated value that he not interfere with the election and that he was now telling me to stay silent because my opinion still didn’t matter (to him). I felt ashamed of what he had done and afraid to discuss it with the faculty sponsor of our organization, who – from my isolated vantage point – seemed distant and uninterested. I had experienced some harassment over that school year and I became diffusely afraid of what would happen if I stuck up for myself by publicly ceding the election. And ashamed of being thought a troublemaker if I took time away from the faculty by asking them for advice on how to handle the situation.</span></p>
<p>This event could have been an opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values, except that I couldn’t even get my own mind right. The other folks in my major just seemed relieved that my opponent had lost and my roommate seemed annoyed with me for even bringing up my problem. In retrospect, there were at least three ways that I could have personally resolved the moral dilemma and secured support for myself to weather any resulting criticism or harassment. But I didn’t know where to turn for the initial supportive brainstorming and discussion that I needed in order to act according to my idealized priorities.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a support system in place, and so I didn’t get the benefit of this trial life threw my way. Instead, I served the next year as if I had won, except that I subordinated myself to the vice president (who had run as the mate of the student who should have won), figuring that he had more of a mandate than I did for how we allocated our money and time in service of the students. And I carried a little ball of shame during that year and after for becoming part of a corrupt situation by not speaking out. It was a cowardly response and therefore did nothing for my confidence or progression to becoming a responsible adult.</p>
<p>How can you ensure that you benefit from these trials as you navigate your college experience toward an adult self? By ensuring you have the resources and confidence to live according to your desired values. Create a multi-layered support and mentoring system for yourself that grows with your throughout your years in university. You can start right when you get to university by taking a few steps that I’ll outline in my next post. And every semester or year, you can take inventory of your support network and update it as needed. Watch for my next post, about creating your personal support system, and a follow up post about accessing support from the administrative resources provided by your university.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryohei Yasuda of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has received a grant by the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH. The award is for $2.9 million over 5 years and will continue the funding of Yasuda’s work with Rab proteins.</p>
<p>Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, Dr. Yasuda is studying Rab proteins’ impact on learning and memory by tracking how molecules become activated and interact with each other. By better understanding how these proteins communicate with each other, scientists may one day be able to develop interventions for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and other brain disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda is a Scientific Director of MPFI and leads the Neuronal Signal Transduction Lab. He has received many recognitions for his outstanding research in neuroscience, including the 2015 National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Pioneer Award, which recognizes scientists demonstrating creativity and groundbreaking approaches in biomedical or behavioral science. Dr. Yasuda was one of only 13 scientists in the country to receive the NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.</p>
<p>Additional awards include the Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the New Investigator Award from the Alzheimer’s Association, and Research Award for Innovative Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda received his PhD in Physics in 1998 from Keio University Graduate School of Science and Technology in Yokohama, Japan. In his PhD studies, he demonstrated that the enzyme ATP synthase is a rotary motor made of single molecule and that its energy conversion efficiency is close to 100%. From 2000 to 2005, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he built an imaging device to monitor protein interactions in living cells with high sensitivity and resolution. From 2005 to 2012, he was an assistant professor of the Neurobiology department at the Duke University Medical Center where he developed a number of techniques to visualize signaling activity in single synapses. From 2009 to 2012, Dr. Yasuda served as an Early Career Scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute before coming to MPFI in 2012.</p>

<p>Sam Sutton's journal club session, where he will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8094937">ASP, Learning to Forget With Adaptive Synaptic Plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks (Panda et al., 2018)</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A fundamental feature of learning in animals is the “ability to forget” that allows an organism to perceive, model, and make decisions from disparate streams of information and adapt to changing environments. Against this backdrop, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) for improved recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) for real time online learning in a dynamic environment. We incorporate an adaptive weight decay mechanism with the traditional spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning to model adaptivity in SNNs. The leak rate of the synaptic weights is modulated based on the temporal correlation between the spiking patterns of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This mechanism helps in gradual forgetting of insignificant data while retaining significant, yet old, information. ASP, thus, maintains a balance between forgetting and immediate learning to construct a stable-plastic self-adaptive SNN for continuously changing inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed learning methodology addresses catastrophic forgetting, while yielding significantly improved accuracy over the conventional STDP learning method for digit recognition applications. In addition, we observe that the proposed learning model automatically encodes selective attention toward relevant features in the input data, while eliminating the influence of background noise (or denoising) further improving the robustness of the ASP learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/26/advance-your-ability-to-account/">Advance your ability to account</a></h4>

<p>This post is the third in a mini-series about <a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/14/constructing-solutions-from-hard-times/">making use of difficult times</a>. First, we discussed <a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/19/dealings-with-feelings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">handling the difficult feelings</a> that can arise. Next, we talked about<a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/22/the-key-to-world-peace-your-personal-opinion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> limiting your scope of information intake</a> and forming your own researched opinion about things that are really important to you. To wrap up, let’s talk about accountability. As in, how do you account for your own and other peoples’ contributions to a situation?</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how to hold people accountable unless it’s modeled for you or you have training. Even something as uncomplicated as how to hold your own self accountable can be difficult. I’m operating with the assumption that most people want to be accountable to themselves and their communities. And most of the time, I think we are accountable, well enough that no mention is made of it and no thought is given to it.</p>
<h4>Accountability to Self</h4>
<p>But wait – how many times recently have you thought of your own behavior (or lack of it), “I really <em>should</em> do . . .” So perhaps being accountable to ourselves is somewhat difficult. People who have thought about this problem much more often and smartly say to set up your environment so that your ideal behavior arises naturally from it. Make your desired behavior the easiest thing to do. Make it the course of action that requires the least amount of thought. As an example, check out <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/#philosophy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt Might’s blog entry</a> about doing pullups regularly to gain muscle strength. He applies the same philosophy to bulking up, losing weight, and working efficiently. It basically amounts to putting in the thought, time, and money up front to radically restructure your environment so that it prompts you to default to your desired behavior.</p>
<p>He also discusses measuring, tracking, and reporting outcomes of your behavior. For the projects he mentions in his blog, this could mean counting calories, weighing yourself, or measuring your waistline. Getting regular feedback from an objective, quantified source about effects of your behavior. Charting your progress over time to see how well your environment is working for you.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that there are four components to Dr. Might’s method of holding oneself accountable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining the goal or desired behavior. The definition must be clear and precise, so that you can track your performance and be confident about whether or not you are meeting your goal.</li>
<li>Setting up your environment so that the desired behavior is the easiest and most natural of all possible choices. That means removing obstacles to the behavior (or confronting limiting fears about engaging in the behavior). And it also means erecting barriers or linking negative outcomes to the other, undesired behaviors.</li>
<li>Going about your daily life without putting unnecessary or repetitive thought into it. Being an academic, Matt Might likes to reserve his thinking resources for original thoughts in service of his field of study. But this thriftiness is probably what makes his strategy so durable – most people want to avoid the exhaustion of needlessly taxing their mental resources.</li>
<li>Regularly receiving objective, quantified feedback about how well you are meeting your goal or the progress you are making toward it. This component assumes you’ve already set up some sort of tracking or logging system, presumably as part of your environmental structuring described above. Now you would be assessing your performance regularly, which will let you know whether your environmental design is working for you or whether you need to make changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this system can work for quantifiable goals where the criteria are objective, the tracking of them is not subject to significant bias, and the tracking can be done by yourself. However, it’s possible to have all these components in place and still fail. For example, if something about the environment gets derailed, it can distract you or thwart your goal. And even if you are tracking your progress, you may find yourself carefully and precisely tracking how you routinely fail to progress toward your goal. So what next?</p>
<h4><strong>Accountability to Others</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s talk about accountability to others. There are several scenarios where we may be accountable to others, ranging from behaviors that directly affect them to goals that aren’t related to them at all. As an example of the latter, let’s continue with our scenario from above. What can you do if you’ve set up your environment to encourage your desired behavior and have tracked your progress faithfully only to find you’re nowhere near your goal?</p>
<p>Having a friend to whom you answer can help with your motivation. It may also provide an opportunity for your friend to informally coach you as you check in about your activity and what factors influence the chances of you meeting your goal each day (or period between check-ins). And, if your friend has a similar personal goal, you may choose to work side-by-side for some goals, making the experience more fun.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve talked about involving someone of your choice, voluntarily, in holding you accountable for a behavior that doesn’t necessarily matter to them. They may care about it for your sake, but if you fail to meet your goal, it’s not going to have much of an effect on them. What I really want to focus on in this section is something a bit more complicated: being accountable to others for behavior that affects them, for which they are far more likely to care about.</p>
<p>The four points above, as discussed for personal goals that don’t involve other people, will be slightly altered in this section to accommodate the necessary interpersonal dynamics.</p>
<p>The first component, defining the goal or desired behavior, may arise out of the expectations of any of the involved persons. I would already have expectations of myself, for how I treat other people or behave around them. These expectations would be based on my values, my environment, my perception of my role in relation to the other persons. The other person would also have expectations of me, also based on our environment, their culture, their knowledge of my culture, their perception of our roles in the context of our relationship. Our mutual expectations may align well without overt discussion, or perhaps we would take an opportunity early in our relationship to define them. If we met in the context of a formal group, the group may provide expectations or may create a defined opportunity for us to set expectations.</p>
<p>Setting up the environment to encourage the desired behavior or relationship dynamics may be more complicated in this situation. Although, if you are part of a formal group or other structure, they may already provide some of that – regular meetings, resources, a work environment, etc. Plus the motivation to visit that environment or use those resources regularly – a salary, acknowledgement, social connection, etc.</p>
<p>The last component, tracking progress or getting feedback, can be more subjective and difficult to implement constructively. It can get us into trouble in ways that just don’t happen when we track our independent goals – like the difference between stepping on a weigh scale and conducting an annual performance review.</p>
<p>In structured groups such as a workplace or lab, it makes sense to institute a formal goal-setting and feedback-giving &amp; receiving routine. This is standard procedure in corporate environments, which often also train their employees in how to conduct these routines constructively.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in five different academic labs as well as one corporation, and I never experienced anything remotely similar to that in academia. I imagine that the administrative levels do and that specific labs might, but I haven’t been aware of resources or encouragement of specific labs to do that nor of a way for the administration or the higher levels of academia to create a standard mechanism for the students to participate in this at the level of, say, their department or school (except for unions, which some schools have and which do sometimes create feedback opportunities, and faculty meetings where specific student reps are named, invited, and supported – but other students are not always aware of the governance nor the way to operate within the structure to give and receive feedback). I consider this a cultural issue with serious implications for the health of academia, which we’ll cover more in a future post.</p>
<p>In other situations or in less formal arrangements such as a roommate chore sheet or a team agreement about workout routines, it makes sense to agree on a “check-in” routine to track progress and possibly also a date at which to review whether the goal or arrangement still makes sense. Start with an informal, verbal agreement for lower-stakes behaviors. For ideas about giving and receiving feedback smoothly, there are many books that can help, including Marshall Rosenberg’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdeYx8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nonviolent Communication</a>, as well as several books written by members of the Harvard Negotiation Project, including <a href="https://amzn.to/2UEnSdN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Getting to Yes</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UAPoZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanks for the Feedback</a>.</p>
<h4>Accountability to the Past</h4>
<p>This part is related to accountability to yourself. It’s takes the concepts of accountability we discussed above and relates it back to what prompted this post in the first place – how we can get the best out of difficult situations and grow from them. Once we have dealt with the feelings arising from them and formed our opinion based on our experience and any research or deep-diving we did according to our own values and priorities, what do we do next?</p>
<p>It’s worth contemplating what made the situation difficult – did it reveal something about our own values or attitudes that we now want to change, or did it involve a difficult person who we just can’t avoid, or was it indicative of some entrenched problem that seems unsolvable or out of our control? One can mine the situation for motivation to change or grow in some way, or perhaps to develop a personal mission or adjust our values and priorities. Formal teams or organizations often do a “lessons learned” exercise after these situations are discovered, in which they analyze each person or party’s contribution to the situation and determine whether new policies need to be added (or existing ones altered) to prevent the situation from recurring.</p>
<p>You can do this individually for difficult situations in your life as well. Do it soon after the situation if you want ideas for personal policies or routines that you wish to change. Give it some distance (in time and context) if you want are looking to change your values, perspective, or if you want to use the difficulty to as some sort of calling in life. Just remember, when looking back on distant situations that give you cause for regret, that the you in that situation is not the you thinking about it now. You can’t recreate your mind at the time with the mind you have now – the limited information and experience you had back then versus all the new research and living you’ve done since the event occurred. So remember not to be too hard on your past self – given your limitations at the time, there probably wasn’t much else you could have done. If you can look back on a distant situation in the past with horror or shock at how badly you navigated it, that is one way of marking how much progress you have made since then in educating yourself or realigning your values. If you make it through both the nearsighted and farsighted forms of analysis and are still feeling moved by some aspect of your experience, it’s more likely to be a legitimate calling for you.</p>
<p>For all of these forms of accountability – to yourself, to others, to your past – it can be a source of real growth if taken seriously. And if you are able to separate your view of yourself from your view of your behavior, it can even be enjoyable.</p>

The Journal of Health Psychology has just published an extraordinary pair of papers that call for a new inquiry into a 30-year old case of probable scientific fraud.

According to Anthony J. Pelosi, author of the main paper, the case was "one of the worst scientific scandals of all time" and yet has never been formally investigated. The journal's editor, David F. Marks, agrees and, in an editorial, also calls for the retraction or correction of up to 61 papers.

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-macritchie-171595">Jennifer MacRitchie</a>, <em><a href="http://theconversation.com/institutions/western-sydney-university-1092">Western Sydney University</a></em></p>
<p>It’s never too late to pick up a musical instrument. In fact, there are many reasons why it’s a great idea, particularly in old age.</p>
<p>We normally hear about reasons to increase music education for children, and for good cause. There are <a href="http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/28/3/269">many cognitive and social benefits</a> to playing an instrument that aid a child’s development. Consequently, as an older adult, there are long-term effects of having taken part in these musical activities, as it can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463047">limit cognitive decline</a>.</p>
<p>Even a <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full">small amount of training</a> can have long-lasting effects. But this doesn’t mean that those who have never played an instrument in childhood have missed the boat. The ageing brain is <em>plastic</em>: that means it is able to learn new things all the time. So, should we consider an increase in music programs for those in the third age?</p>
<h2>Playing music as a workout for the brain</h2>
<p>Learning to play a musical instrument is an extremely complex task that involves the coordination of multiple sensory systems within the brain. Many instruments require precise coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands in order to play a musical note. Using the resulting sound as feedback, the brain prepares for the next note and so it continues. The act of music-making is quite a brain workout.</p>
<p>The relationship between the motor and auditory parts of the brain is strengthened when physically playing music. This may explain why adults trained to <em>play</em> certain melodies have an <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/39/9632.long">enhanced representation of music</a> in the brain compared to adults only trained to <em>listen</em> to the same melodies.</p>
<p>As playing music involves many different parts of the brain, even a short-term program for older adult musical novices can lead to generalised improvements for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00810/full">cognitive ability</a>.</p>
<h2>Music as a workout for the fingers</h2>
<p>Learning to play an instrument such as the piano involves many complex finger sequencing and coordination tasks. As such, it can be a great test-bed for learning to move fingers independently.</p>
<p>The creativity of music and the enjoyment people take in playing is particularly important for rehabilitation, as it encourages sustained practice leading ultimately to higher benefits.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a><span class="attribution"><span class="source">Shutterstock</span></span></figure>
<p>It’s thanks to this that piano lessons have been used to successfully retrain hand function for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00662/full">patients who have had a stroke</a>. The immediate auditory feedback from each finger movement is thought to help adults <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721795">reduce errors in movement</a> and work towards moving at a more regular pace.</p>
<p>Music training is an excellent environment to train cognitive and motor abilities, both in the contexts of child development and for rehabilitation. The question for older adults is this: can learning a musical instrument not only put the brakes on cognitive and motor decline but actually allow development of new skills?</p>
<p>Older adults can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1995805/">improve their motor learning</a> – that is, they can improve their rate of learning new things – and the best environments for brain training are ones that are <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00183/full">novel and flexible</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, many activities can be novel such as juggling or knitting, but the advantages of learning an instrument can be found in the breadth of skills required to play. At Western Sydney University, we are currently investigating how piano training can be used with healthy older adults to improve their general hand function in unrelated daily tasks.</p>
<h2>Music for health and wellbeing</h2>
<p>Often, the worry is that playing an instrument will be too difficult for older adults to manage. On the contrary, learning to play an instrument can provide a great sense of <a class="broken_link" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41162324">achievement</a> and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Older adults relish the opportunity to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2014.999361">learn something new</a>.<br />
Cognitive benefits aside, music can also be a great <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02601370.2014.991951">social activity for older adults</a>, facilitating social bonding and decreasing feelings of loneliness or isolation.</p>
<p>Music programs are linked to improvements measured in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005138">markers of the body’s immune system</a> such as the presence of antibodies and vital signs (heart rate/blood pressure).</p>
<p>It’s suggested that this is a consequence of decreases in stress that can happen when taking part in musical activities. However, further research is needed to determine exactly how this relationship functions.</p>
<h2>Music for all</h2>
<p>It’s vital to understand how we can aid the current generation of older adults, in terms of both health and personal enjoyment. With the myriad benefits provided by playing a musical instrument, it would seem beneficial to have a wider variety of musical activities on offer to the older generation.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if the third age wasn’t viewed as a final descent from some mid-life peak, but some new act of life that opens up these opportunities? Perhaps we should give older adults the chance to develop in ways they could never have imagined before.</p>
<p>Activities such as singing in a choir, or playing the piano can provide this opportunity, as well as offering many general benefits to health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So whether it’s in independent living, retirement or assisted care, let’s make the third act of life a musical one!<img alt="The Conversation" height="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/57799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" style="border: none !important; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important;" width="1" /></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/22/the-key-to-world-peace-your-personal-opinion/">Design an Information Equilibrium for Inner Peace</a></h4>

<p>You’ve heard it before: the key to peace isn’t in your surroundings or possessions, it’s in your mind. This isn’t a post about mindfulness though, rather a way to use your mind and time to encourage your own agency.  Activating that sense of agency in service of your own values, in a coherent and meaningful way, can provide a sense of calm and stability, and can be brought about relatively quickly, without requiring years of training in a Buddhist monastery. Your own personal thoughts about the events in your world hold the key to this peaceful existence.</p>
<p>It might not look like it yet, but this is actually a post about information overload. What it is and how to avoid it. We already know why it’s important to avoid: maintaining a realistic diet of information intake prevents burnout and helps us stay present and focused in reality.</p>
<p>Most of us feel some responsibility to stay informed of current events. We keep up through a diet of local and global news. On TV, news sites, and social media, we stay up-to-date on the happenings in our neighborhoods, friend and peer circles, alumni or school networks, cities, countries, and world. And we can spend hours every day doing this, to the detriment of our jobs and home duties, our families and our concentration.</p>
<p>Self-help sites suggest formulas or tools for maintaining a balance of information intake. But what it really comes down to is this: which information is actually going to change your behavior or perspective? Because that’s the information worth spending time and attention on.</p>
<p>If you vote in federal or state elections, that’s a good reason to stay up-to-date on national and world news. If you lobby your members of Congress or vote in local elections, that’s a good reason to stay current on more local news. If you travel abroad, donate to international charities, or like to discuss world events with your friends, those are good reasons to keep up with headlines and international news. If you have or desire a career in a particular field, it’s a good idea to keep up with the news related to your field and to any potential vendors or clients. But if all those stories just worry you and you’ve never done anything about them and never plan to, that’s not the most effective use of your time.</p>
<p>The same goes for social media – if you have real life relationships to maintain or a brand to sustain, or if you need to be aware of the online climate in your social network for some other reason, it makes sense to spend some time online to complement your real-life connections. But if you find yourself spending a lot of time staying up-to-date with people you never talk to in real life and will probably never see again in person, that’s another route to information overload.</p>
<p>One can argue that a minimal level of attention to these additional news sources is necessary to maintain an ambient awareness of your surroundings. I certainly subscribe to that view. So I don’t know what the best ratio is, as long as most of your information intake consist of news about people or things that you have some influence over or some passion about, some way to contribute.  And if you really must spend time consuming news or opinion pieces or community gossip for which you have no forseeable use, at least write about your own opinion of it in a personal journal occasionally. Better to be a motivated participant in the stories that receive so much of your attention than an ineffectual bystander.</p>
<p>Think about all the time you’ve spent reading or hearing stories that generate a lot of feelings. Now consider how you have acted on those feelings – did it give you confidence about how to vote, or inspire you to spend your time differently, or motivate you to communicate with someone? If you can increase the return on your investment of feelings and time by acting constructively on what you consume (and reduce the fruitless consumption of information), the better for your mental health and sense of peace. If the time you spend reading news is also directly preparing you to act in your life, there’s not so much burnout. You’ll feel more effective and valuable.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to form your own opinions more readily. Rather than having a diffuse understanding of current events, you’ll have a multi-level appreciation of the stories you do know. The broader perspective can be combined with your own first-hand experience and analysis to generate a unique personal opinion that is yours to share and debate. You’ll be less likely to contribute to rumor mills and internet shaming, more likely to have spent time reading about a subject that’s actually worth your while. The extra time freed up by whittling down your news sources can be used to dive deep into the stories that really interest you.</p>
<p>This strategy can make you a better conversationalist and also a more valuable voice in the conversation. By owning your interests and opinions in current events, you’ll increase your credibility with others and your confidence with yourself. Here’s an exercise you can try to help make this shift in your own life. Over the course of a whole day, take note of the scope and quality of the information you take in, as well as what actions or other significant changes that information adds to your life or environment. If you find that you’re sinking a lot of time into an unrewarding source of information, find an alternative way to spend that time. You’ll probably feel better about yourself and your world.</p>

<p>This is my impression of my information pipeline. This is the simplified version, meant to show that information should be processed and kept on the move. There are any number of output pipes and branching systems. The key here is to keep content out of the holding tank at the bottom. Venting it is annoying if you’re not into exercise. The key is, don’t pay too much attention or thought to any given feeling unless you have something good to do about it. If information is causing a backup in the pipeline because it generates a lot of feelings or thoughts but there’s no output for it, either you have to reconfigure the pipeline if you plan for more of those type to come through, or you gotta prevent that sort of information from getting into your pipeline in the first place:</p>

<p>Volker Steuber's journal club session, where he will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this talk, Volker will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding. Volker will focus on temporal coding and summarise John Hopfield's (1995) suggestion how neurons with subthreshold oscillations in their membrane potential could perform scale-invariant temporal encoding of input patterns (and which conditions have to be met for the encoding  to be scale invariant). However, temporal coding is sensitive to noise, and Volker will describe the rank order decoding scheme that was suggested by Simon Thorpe (1998) in order to provide robustness against noise. Furthermore, Volker will outline how Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex could implement a form of rank-order decoding of temporal parallel fibre input patterns.</p>
<p>Volker will reference the following papers:</p>

<h4>A reading guide</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/403/1*DNvVecLKf4jnFIFwNFyfiw.png" /></figure><p>I founded The Spike in 2016 to bring the triumphs and challenges of modern systems neuroscience to a broad audience. Our readers represent a diverse swathe of the scientifically-curious public. We also draw our readers from many fields with an interest in the deep secrets of the brain, from clinicians and neurologists, scientists of all stripes, and researchers in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Reflecting that diverse audience, our essays have covered everything from a primer on dopamine, to the limits of what we can learn from neuroscience experiments. There are rich pickings here for anyone curious about the brain: students looking to understand the cutting edge of neuroscience, to those looking for inspiration for the next generation of AI, to researchers at the forefront of neuroscience looking to see how their work fits into a wider context.</p><p>To help you find your way, here is an A to Z guide to the topics, themes, and subjects we’ve published on in The Spike. (We’ll update this page with every new piece, so check back here!) If nothing else, in compiling this list I learnt a few lessons: how little I write about stuff I work on directly in my day-to-day; that we’ve covered a lot about some things (e.g. cortex) and strangely little of others (e.g. learning); and that Frozen was playing so often in our house at one point that it seeped into everything (see entry: <em>Frozen (Disney)</em>).</p><p>All pieces are

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/02/19/dealings-with-feelings/">Dealings with feelings</a></h4>

<p>Most of us can appreciate the difficulty of experiencing feelings. Do feelings have to be difficult? Probably. But that doesn’t mean that’s all they have to be. Today I want to spend some time discussing how to extricate that little bit of fun that resides in the possibilities indicated by most of the tough feelings – anger, anxiety, boredom, confusion, envy, fear, frustration, guilt, humiliation, imposter syndrome, jealousy, panic, schadenfreude, self-righteousness, shame, sorrow, suspicion. Or if not fun, at least a sliver of something constructive.</p>
<p>But first, what makes tough feelings difficult? I think it is because they feel physically uncomfortable and we often don’t know how to act on them. There are probably other reasons I am missing, but let’s start with those two. There are things we can do about those two aspects.</p>
<h4>The Physical Experience of Emotion</h4>
<p>Physical discomfort. What does that phrase call to mind? Cold feet, burning indigestion, tensed muscles, strained lungs? When it comes to discomfort caused by feelings – changes in pulse, blood pressure, facial muscle activation, breathing pattern, adrenaline levels, concentration – part of the struggle is that those sensations have additional meaning to us, beyond just an emotion. We associate them with risk and survival. It can be difficult to tolerate the physical manifestation of a feeling if you think it’s indicative that your body is going to fail you at any moment. To decrease the additional fear and stress that comes from worrying about your survival, it can help to appreciate that your body is capable of withstanding a lot of acute stress, much more than would be inflicted by one of these difficult feelings.</p>
<p>Without that existential worry, your mind is freed up to contemplate a more constructive thought while your body is in the throes of an emotion. One such thought could be, “my reality is more than this emotion.” Because this feeling will pass. Its origins may or may not be important to you. You may or may not decide to act on it. You won’t always feel so uncomfortable, and there are probably things you can do to reduce the risk of this particular feeling recurring.</p>
<p>If you find yourself often experiencing a particular emotion that seems overwhelming, you can learn to develop a tolerance for it so that it doesn’t affect you as much. It helps if you can first label the particular feeling that causes overwhelming discomfort for you.  The next time you find yourself overwhelmed by a feeling, take a look at this study by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/2/646/F2.large.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nummenmaa and colleagues (PNAS 2014)</a>. Figure 2 shows how people tend to perceive higher or lower levels of activation in various parts of the body during specific emotions. Once you have an idea of how a troublesome emotion manifests in your body and have a label for that emotion, you can work with it on your own terms. We’ve all heard about the benefits of mindfulness, but perhaps have not experienced what it can do for you in terms of emotional capacity.</p>
<p>Try intentionally putting yourself into a particular emotional state for a few minutes a day over a period of several days, and your ability to tolerate that emotion will probably increase. Meaning, you won’t feel so much distress or additional side effect feelings about experiencing that primary emotional state. For some audio recordings to help with this exercise, check out the “Stepping into …” links from <a href="https://www.mindfulness-solution.com/DownloadMeditations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the website of Dr. Ron Seigel</a>, a mindfulness clinician. There are many other websites dedicated to these types of resources, so you can really get into it if you choose this strategy.</p>
<p>Neglected in this section is the possibility of discomfort from positive emotions. The angst of suspecting that your love interest might have feelings for you. The unbearable warmth of receiving praise from your idol. The constriction of receiving caring attention from people you have long distrusted. The overwhelming sensation of drowning in affection that counters your long-held knowledge of being generally unlovable. These scenarios are tragedies to be addressed in a future post, but they deserve a mention here for being just as unwelcome and destabilizing – with similar potential for harm – as the difficult emotions listed earlier.</p>
<h4>Acting on Emotions</h4>
<p>Most importantly, when it comes to acting on emotions: you don’t have to act on them. The stronger your ability to tolerate an emotion, the more control you have over whether you act on it and how. Although I tend to think you should usually act on emotions, if only by writing in a journal about what led to them or what you plan to do about them. I see them as motivators for growth – that extra drive to get over the energy barrier to whatever constructive risks you’ve been considering recently.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I use this guide to help me figure out what to do for certain emotions. It provides a shortcut for translating the emotion into a positive force, at least for me. These aren’t professional recommendations and they’re definitely not meant to deal with  serious, clinically diagnosable conditions related to these feelings. Just the every-day variety. It may be useful to go through these for yourself and make your own recommended shortcuts for each feeling. What other feelings would you add to this list?</p>
<ul>
<li>Anger – an opportunity to vocalize your values and expectations, regardless of whether they were met or respected</li>
<li>Anxiety – a reminder to write in your journal</li>
<li>Boredom – a reminder to get up and exercise</li>
<li>Confusion – an opportunity to learn more about others’ philosophies and assumptions and perhaps share your own</li>
<li>Embarrassment – an opportunity to solicit empathetic connections from those around you or to request/make space and distance for yourself</li>
<li>Envy- a learning opportunity or an opportunity for curiosity – “how did they do it and how can I make that happen in my own life?”  “How would that look in my life? What do I have to gain from that?” or to find out for yourself how to borrow or experience a bit of what that person seems to have</li>
<li>Fear – an opportunity to responsibly investigate the mysteries affecting your own life</li>
<li>Frustration – an opportunity to imagine a better future. The more frustration you feel, the more detail with which you can imagine this future. Including your place in it and how you might get there. If the frustration endures for long enough, you can even envision how you might achieve that future goal independently of the person or scenario that triggered your frustration.</li>
<li>Guilt – an opportunity to make amends to yourself regarding your past behavior</li>
<li>Humiliation – an opportunity for urgent goal-setting. Or for instant and powerful clarity. What have you been unable to see before, or not had enough information to confidently assess for yourself, that you can now see clearly enough to act on?</li>
<li>Imposter syndrome – an opportunity for more focused curiosity. You know where you want to be or at least where you’re headed, because you’ve already advanced far enough into that environment to realize that you feel unprepared or unqualified to be there. This is good news because it means you’re probably surrounded by people who know what they’re doing well enough to teach you or model it for you. Conduct formal or informal informational interviews to figure out what people do, what are the minimum requirements of knowledge and experience. Find a mentor who can help you assess your place in this ecosystem by giving you honest and realistic, constructive feedback.</li>
<li>Jealousy – an opportunity to be grateful or to set expectations – What have you neglected to be grateful for in your life? What can you better appreciate? Which of your expectations are not being met, and which expectations are unreasonable?</li>
<li>Panic – an opportunity for intense and urgent connection with nearby beings or talking loudly to yourself, if alone</li>
<li>Regret – an opportunity to reflect on your own recent growth or to teach others about</li>
<li>Schadenfreude (or the anticipation of it) – a teaching opportunity or excitement at the possibility for a future empathizer – what have I learned that I want others to know? What is likely to (or already) happening to someone in my life that will make them better able to empathize with my past suffering?</li>
<li>Self-righteousness – an opportunity to laugh at yourself.  Or to brainstorm alternative ways of living, doing business, or interacting with folks</li>
<li>Shame – an opportunity to make amends to your broader community regarding your past behavior</li>
<li>Sorrow – an opportunity to make a sincere apology or inspired work of art</li>
<li>Suspicion – an opportunity to update your assumptions and beliefs or to explore a new aspect of the world</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Knowing there’s something to be done with any given feeling makes it easier to host and acknowledge the feeling. What gets in the way? Hopelessness, helplessness, and the like. Wrongly learned links between feelings and unwanted outcomes are part of what make feelings difficult. Once you’ve developed the capacity for a feeling and learned how to let your feelings guide you in constructive actions, you’re on your way to a much healthier and more enjoyable relationship with your feelings.</p>
<p>This post focused on some of the negative emotions because those are often the ones that trip us up. And while this list is nowhere near <a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2016/08/12/martha-nussbaum-on-emotions-ethics-and-literature/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Martha Nussbaum</a> levels of resolution in the gradation of feelings, it’s a reasonable start if you’re new to this type of thinking. Having spent many years now in academia, I had a lot of ideas for both frustration and imposter syndrome. You may wish to create your own action prompts based on your personality.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/597640164/0/oupblogpsychology/">A bull-session with bacteria</a></h4>

<blockquote><p>Arthur S. Reber’s new book argues that consciousness was present in the first living cells, and that even the simplest of organisms, the prokaryotes like bacteria, are sentient. In this piece, he imagines what it would be like to sit down with two bacteria and hear their opinions on consciousness, and how their sentience helps them keep alive despite the best efforts of humans.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Arthur Reber: I’ve got what I need here: a microscope, two Petri dishes, and the Universal Translator that the curators of the James T. Kirk Star Trek Museum loaned me for the day. Fabulous piece of digital mastery this thing is. So let’s get started.</strong></p><p><strong>Let me begin with you <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_salivarius"><em>Lactobacillus salivarius</em></a>, one of the most beneficial of bacteria. I’m finding that folks are having trouble accepting that single-celled species like you have a legitimate consciousness. How does this make you feel?</strong></p><p><em><strong>Lactobacillus salivarius</strong></em>: In a word, annoyed. We’ve been around for several billions of years waiting for someone to figure this out. Thanks for giving us the chance to speak out today.</p><p><strong>AR</strong>: <strong>You’re quite welcome. You know the project started with a mostly one-way chat I had with a caterpillar some years ago. I’d have gotten to you sooner if I’d known I could get my hands on the Universal Translator. But, no matter. Let me turn to your friend, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. Uh, <em>M. tuberculosis,</em> you won’t mind if I sit back a bit.</strong></p><p><strong><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em></strong>: Not a problem. I understand. You know that we don’t have evil intentions. We do what we do because of simple Darwinian mechanisms and that includes protecting ourselves from onslaughts of antibiotics.</p><p><strong>AR: I know but still …. Let me get to heart of the issue of prokaryote sentience. Do both of you have feelings? Do you have internal subjective experiences? Or, as philosopher Thomas Nagel put it, is there something it is like to be a bacterium?</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Of course we do and of course there is. Look, there are molecules in this dish, some are tasty and nutritious, some decidedly not. Some are supportive of life. Others, not so much. How could I absorb the good ones and avoid the toxic ones if I didn’t have a good feeling when encountering say lactose but feel pain when I run into a concentrated salt solution?</p><p><strong>LS</strong>: Moreover, we have clusters of receptors on our membranes. We can detect up to fifty different kinds of stimuli, temperature, nutrient gradients. We sense light using rhodopsin, the same molecule you use.</p><p><strong>AR</strong>: <strong>That is very impressive. Tell me more. I understand you also learn and can form memories. How can you do these remarkable things when you’re just a single celled critter?</strong></p><p><strong>LS</strong>: Well, first I’m not fond of being called a “critter” but I’ll let it pass. Of course we learn and, more obviously, what’s the point of being able to learn if you can’t set up memories?</p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Last week someone in your lab tried to fool me. First she flooded my dish with some sugar that I really liked — later I discovered it was lactose. Then she followed that with another sugar which turned out to be maltose. It was okay, but not as tasty as that first batch. But that’s okay because I know how to handle these different sugars. I simply modify my biomolecular functions to accommodate whatever sugar is around.</p><p><strong>AR</strong>: <strong>You <em>what</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Shift metabolic functions. Goodness, you just don’t appreciate the things we can do. But, back to the sugars. Then things got really interesting. Suddenly my little home was flooded with the first sugar again. So I shifted my metabolism to make it easier to absorb. Then, bingo, back to the other one. It didn’t take long to realize what she was up to. So I did the obvious. As soon as the lactose stopped I began anticipating the maltose so I’d be ready to maximize absorption. And ditto with the maltose. So everything was cool, right? I’d learned a simple pattern and was doing just fine. You know what your stinker of a lab-mate did then? She bloody tricked me. After a dose of maltose she gave me another one. Caught me totally off-guard. Here I was, metabolically prepared for a really tasty sugar and I got smacked with a second rate dessert that I was so not ready to consume.</p><p><strong>AR</strong>: <strong>Well, I guess I’m sorry for any distress she caused you but she was just trying to see if you could learn a simple pattern. But how about that memory thing. What kinds of memories do you and your unicellular friends have? <em>Salivarius</em>, can you tell us?</strong></p><p><strong>LS</strong>: Sure, but it really should be obvious. I hang around in people’s insides where the temperature often changes. I happen to like some temperatures better than others. As I swim from one area to another I sense temperature gradients looking for the most comfortable. Then I either stay where I am, go forward, or retreat. How could I make the right choice if I didn’t have a memory of the temperature of the medium that I was in before?</p><p><strong>AR</strong>:<strong> Huh. Makes sense. But that, if you don’t mind my saying so, isn’t all that impressive. You’re only talking about a second or two. I’m not even sure everyone would agree with you calling this a “memory.”</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Look, Arthur, let’s not make this little chat nasty. I could send some of the folks from my family your way.</p><p><strong>AR</strong>:<strong> Alright. Sorry. But seriously, can you form more permanent memories?</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Let me tell you what a friend of ours does and see if you don’t think this is an instance of an ontologically secure biomolecular representation — you can look that up if that phrase is too sophisticated for you.</p><p><strong>AR: Ok, I already said I was out of line so you can stop with the snarky remarks. Just tell me about memories in prokaryotes.</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: There’s a species of sessile prokaryotes – “sessile”, if you don’t know, means <em>stationary</em> –<em>Caulobacter crescentus</em>, that can hold onto a memory for up to two hours.</p><p><strong>AR: Fascinating. Tell me more.</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: A group of <em>C. crescentus</em> was clinging to a piece of lab detritus that one of your colleagues left in their dish when suddenly a wave of concentrated salt solution hit them. Frankly, we’re pretty sure it was done by your friend with the flip-flopping sugars. But they did what we all do in these situations, shift metabolism to be able to mitigate the situation — uh, you’re okay if I use big words like “mitigate”?</p><p><strong>AR: You can stop insulting me anytime you want. Get on with the story.</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: My, my, we are the sensitive one aren’t we? Anyway, your sadistic cell biologist friend did this several times. It became clear that my sessile friends were going to have to play “scout” — you know, like in “be prepared” — and hold on to the memory of nasty salt solutions and maintain the appropriate metabolic condition. They got so good at it that the metabolic memory could last for up to two hours. And, here’s the interesting part. When <em>C. crescentus</em> divides the “mother” cells stay and the “daughter” cells swim away looking for their own perch (yeah, I know, gender-linked terms aren’t PC but that’s the way it is).</p><p>At this point your nasty friend did it again. Another wave of salty water. The mother cells, because they held onto to the metabolic memory, had a pretty high survival rate while the poor daughter cells, having swum to a presumably safe place, succumbed in large numbers. They had no need to recall events from the past — or thought they didn’t need to. You see why we’re suspicious of your kind.</p><p><strong>AR: That’s pretty impressive. But I won’t apologize for my species. Anything else?</strong></p><p><strong>LS</strong>: Sure, I spent several hours the other day being forced over a tiny bridge between two Petri dishes. I say “forced” because she (and you know who “she” is) kept putting all the good food in whichever dish I wasn’t in. And worse, she put drops of an acid that really hurt to touch. It didn’t take me long to realize that there was a pattern to the acid drops and I was soon able to navigate the bridge without touching anything icky. That, I was thinking, will show <em>her</em>. Needless to say she then moved the acid spots and I had to learn a whole new pathway. I did this faster than the first time — and I hope you can see why.</p><p><strong>AR: Well you guys are telling quite a story. Maybe folks will have a bit more respect for you, my tiny friends. One thing is clear, you’re both great conversationalists.</strong></p><p><strong>LS</strong>: But we communicate all the time among ourselves.</p><p><strong>AR: Seriously?</strong></p><p><strong>LS</strong>: Yeah, seriously. We have to. We like to form colonies, hang around together. If a collective gets big funny stuff happens. Those of us in the center find that the nutrients, which are mainly on the periphery, aren’t getting to us. So we send out a molecular signal that travels through the collective asking our friends out there to slow down, reduce metabolism, stop dividing so much. They always do. We’re a very altruistic bunch. So the tasty bits come down our way. We absorb them and we send out another message basically saying “ok, we’re fine now.” And things go back to normal.</p><p><strong>AR: So what you’re telling me is that when life began minds came along for the ride. The bottom line is that life and sentience are, and I hope you won’t mind my using a big word, <em>co-terminous</em>. Just as all life, no matter how complex, evolved from prokaryotes, all minds, all forms of consciousness, no matter how complex did as well. A nice theory. I like it.</strong><br /><strong>Now I’ve got to get the Universal Translator back. The battery light is blinking so the interview will have to end. Thanks to you both.</strong></p><p><strong>LS and MT</strong>: And thanks to you and the folks at the museum for letting us tell our tale.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Microscope photo” by Ousa Chea.

                <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2019/02/14/modelling-nicotine-addiction.html">Modelling nicotine addiction</a></h4>

<p>Reinoud Maex's journal club session, where he will summerise the work he did in Paris, which was sponsored by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.catalystbiosciences.com/">Targacept</a>: a pharmaceutical company which specialised in nicotinic compounds.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Nicotine and nicotinic compounds bind to acetylcholine receptors, but, surprisingly, it is largely unknown whether they act by activating or by desensitising (= inactivating) these receptors.</p>
<p>We simulated a simple circuit of dopaminergic and gaba-ergic neurons, each of them expressing different subtypes of nicotinic receptors.</p>
<p>Our main conclusion was that many nicotinic compounds act by desensitising their receptors. We also formulated a new hypothesis on nicotine addiction. We propose that smoking in addicted people my be a form of self-medication: by desensitising the nicotinic receptors on GABAergic neurons, nicotine disinhibits the dopamine-neurons and restores their physiological response to acetylcholine.</p>

<h2>Good Cholesterol Can Positively Impact Women’s Brain Health</h2>
<p>Statistics bear out the folk wisdom that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1018115">women live longer than men</a>. However, living longer doesn’t necessarily equate to living better. All too often, dementia robs older women of what could be the happiest time of their lives. And while medical science continues to try to solve the problem of dementia, to date, there is no cure.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease represents approximately <a href="https://www.dementia.org.au/about-dementia/types-of-dementia/alzheimers-disease">60-80% of all dementia cases</a>, but it is just one of approximately 50 known causes of dementia. Yet, we’ve hardly even scratched the surface on treating Alzheimer’s, let alone those many other lesser-known causes. Nearly two-thirds of those suffering from dementia are women, yet <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/how-good-cholesterol-can-keep-women-s-brains-healthy">researchers</a> have only performed a handful of studies to study how the disease progresses in females.</p>
<p>However, two<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9887-z"> recent</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9970-5">studies</a> at the <a href="https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/medicine-and-radiology-research/royal-melbourne-hospital/healthy-ageing-program/womens-healthy-ageing-project">Women’s Healthy Ageing Project</a> at the University of Melbourne are now bringing to light not only how dementia develops in women, but also how women can delay or prevent it. Much of the research points to two systems of the body — the cardiovascular system (heart) and the nervous system (brain) — and how they work in tandem to either slow down or speed up the development of dementia.</p>
<h2>Grey and White Matter and Dementia</h2>
<p>There are two types of brain matter: <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18117.htm">white matter and grey matter. </a></p>
<p>Researchers discovered the amount of grey matter a woman has at age 60 can serve as a reliable predictor of her memory ability at age 70.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that one sure sign of dementia in older adults is a decrease in grey matter volume. What’s new about the research at the University of Melbourne, however, is how to potentially <em>prevent</em> this decline in grey matter.</p>
<p>That’s where the cardiovascular system comes into play.</p>
<p>Our brains require a lot of blood, and proper circulation is critical to ensuring our brains receive not only the rich oxygen blood provides but also valuable nutrients and fats the brain needs to thrive.</p>
<h2>What Role Does Cholesterol Play in Brain Health?</h2>
<p>One simple rule when it comes to heart health and brain health is:  ‘what’s good for your heart is good for your brain’.</p>
<p>Dementia Australia recommends five steps to reduce your risk of dementia, and <a href="https://yourbrainmatters.org.au/5-simple-steps/step-1-look-after-your-heart">‘Look after your heart’</a> is rule number one!</p>
<h2>The bad:</h2>
<p>When women develop a high level of LDL, or ‘bad’ <a href="http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides">cholesterol,</a> it clogs blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the brain. Starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients causes grey matter mass to decline. White matter also sustains damage from lack of adequate blood flow, meaning the different parts of the brain no longer “talk” to each other the way they previously did.</p>
<p>The result, predictably, is a drastic decline in cognitive function, including the ability to remember learned information and the ability to form new memories. When allowed to continue unchecked, dementia develops at a much faster rate.</p>
<h2>The good:</h2>
<p>On the other hand, women with normal levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol, called HDL which carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver showed less <em>white matter</em> damage in their brain a decade later when they conducted late-life brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments 20 years later.</p>
<p>The Women’s Healthy Ageing Project researchers point out that maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol impacts on the structure of the brain directly.</p>
<p>To lower your risk of developing dementia, or to stave it off as long as possible, it’s critical to talk to your doctor about getting your cholesterol under control.</p>
<blockquote><p>“These findings suggest strategies to target major cardiovascular risk factors at midlife might also be effective in reducing the development of brain lesions and late life cognitive decline,”</p></blockquote>
<p>says Professor Szoeke, one of the lead researchers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“And while our findings relate to women, we know healthy lifestyles are important for men to maintain their brain health, too.”</p></blockquote>

Now here's a paper with an interesting title: The dark matter of the brain



Author Saak V. Ovsepian argues that "the great majority of nerve cells in the intact brain do not fire action potentials, i.e., are permanently silent." This is a remarkable claim, and it raises the question of what these silent neurons are doing. However, I didn't find myself convinced of the existence of this 'dark matter'.

<p>What is a metaphor? Essentially, a metaphor is an analogy that doesn’t say its name. We use metaphors all the time without even noticing it, as was beautifully demonstrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">Lakoff &amp; Johnson (1980)</a>. When I say for example, “let me cast some light on this issue”, I am using a fairly sophisticated metaphor in which I make an analogy between understanding and seeing. In that analogy, an explanation allows you to understand, in the same way as light allows you to see. You might then reply: I <em>see</em> what you mean, it is <em>clearer</em>! Chances are that, in normal conversation, we would not have noticed that we both used a metaphor.</p>
<p>Metaphors are everywhere in neuroscience, and in biology more generally (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/metaphors/">these posts</a>). For example: <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvi-is-optimization-a-good-metaphor-of-evolution/">evolution optimizes</a> traits (see the excellent article of <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf">Gould &amp; Lewontin (1979)</a> for a counterpoint); <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/">the genome is a code for the organism</a> (see Denis Noble (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060581/">2011a</a>; <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsfs.2011.0067">2011b</a>)); the <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/">brain runs algorithms</a>, or <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">is a computer</a> (see also <a href="http://www.cisek.org/pavel/Pubs/Cis1999.pdf">Paul Cisek</a> (1999) or <a href="http://fredericjoignot.blogspirit.com/archive/2006/06/23/francisco-varela-neurobiologiste-et-bouddhiste.html">Francisco Varela</a>); <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">neural activity is a code</a>.</p>
<p>These metaphors are so ingrained in neuroscientific thinking that many object to the very idea that they are metaphorical. The objection is that “evolution is optimization” or “brain runs algorithms” is not a metaphor, it is a <em>theory</em>. Or, for the more dogmatic, these are not metaphors, these are <em>facts</em>.</p>
<p>Indisputable truths belong to theology, not science, so any claim that a general proposition is a <em>fact</em> should be seen as suspect – it is an expression of dogmatism. But there is a case that we are actually talking about theories. In the case of neural codes or brains as computers, one might insist that the terms “code” or “computer” refer to abstract properties, not to concrete objects like a desktop computer. But this is a misunderstanding of what a metaphor, or more generally an analogy, is. When I am “casting light on this issue”, I am not referring to any particular lamp, but to an abstract concept of light which does not actually involve photons. The question is not whether words are actually some sort of photons, but whether the functional relation between light and seeing is similar to the functional relation between explanation and understanding. There is no doubt that these concepts are abstracted from actual properties of concrete situations (of light and perception), but so are the concepts of code and computer. In the metaphor, it is the abstract properties that are at stake, so the objection “it is not a metaphor, it is a theory” either misunderstands what metaphor is (a metaphor <em>is</em> a theory), or perhaps really means “the theory is correct” – again dogmatism.</p>
<p>For the mathematically minded, a mathematical concept that captures this idea is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism">morphism</a>”. A morphism is a map that preserves structure. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism">group homomorphism</a> f from X to Y is such that f(a*b) = f(a) x f(b): the operation * defined on X is mapped to the operation x defined on Y (of course “metaphors are morphisms” is a metaphor!).</p>
<p>For example, in the “let me cast light on this issue” metaphor, I am mapping the domain of visual perception to the domain of linguistic discourse: light -&gt; words; visual object -&gt; issue ; seeing -&gt; understanding. What makes the metaphor interesting is that some relations within the first domain are mapped to relations in the other domain: use of light on an object causes seeing; use of words on an issue causes understanding.</p>
<p>Another example in science is the analogy between the heart and a pump. Each element of the pump (e.g. valve, liquid) is mapped to an element of the heart, and the analogy is relevant because functional relations between elements of the pump are mapped to corresponding relations between elements of the heart. Thus, the analogy has explanatory power. What makes a metaphor or an analogy interesting is not the fact that the two domains are similar (they are generally not), but the richness of the structure preserved by the implied morphism.</p>
<p>In other words, a metaphor or an analogy is a theory that takes inspiration from another domain (e.g. computer science), by mapping some structure from one domain to the other. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, on the contrary. Why then is the term “metaphor” so vehemently opposed in science ? Because the term implies that the theory is questionable (hence, again, dogmatism). There are ways in which understanding is like seeing, but there are also ways in which it is different.</p>
<p>Let us consider the metaphor “the brain implements algorithms”, <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/">which I previously discussed</a>. Some are irritated by the very suggestion that <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736">this might even be a metaphor</a>. The rhetorical strategy is generally two-fold: 1) by “algorithm”, we mean some abstract property, not programs written in C++; 2) the definition of “algorithm” is made general enough that it is trivially true, in which case it is not a metaphor since it is literally true. As argued, (1) is a misunderstanding of linguistics because metaphor <em>is</em> about abstract properties. And if we follow (2), then nothing can be inferred from the statement. Thus, it is only to the extent that “the brain implements algorithms” is metaphorical that it is insightful (and it is to some extent, but in my view to a limited extent).</p>
<p>The key question, thus, is what we mean by “algorithm”. A natural starting point would be to take the definition from a computer science textbook. The most used textbook on the subject is probably Cormen et al., <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Introduction to algorithms</a>. It proposes the following definition: “<em>a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output</em>”. One would need to define what “computational” means in this context, but it is not key for this discussion. With this definition, to say that the brain implements an algorithm means that there exists a morphism between brain activity and a sequence of computational steps. That is, intermediate values of the algorithm are mapped to properties of brain activity (e.g. firing rates measured over some time window) - this is the “encoding”. Then we claim that this mapping has the property that a computational step linking two values is mapped to the operation of the dynamics of the brain linking the two corresponding neural measurements. I explain in the third part of my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">essay on neural coding</a> why this claim cannot be correct, at least not generally and only approximately (one reason is that a measurement of neural activity must be done on some time window, and thus cannot be considered as an initial state of a dynamical system, from which you could deduce the future dynamics). But this is not the point of this discussion. The point is that this claim, that there is a morphism between an algorithm and brain activity, is not trivial and it has explanatory value. In other words, it is interesting. This stems from the rich structure that is being mapped between the two domains.</p>
<p>Since it is not trivial (as in fact any metaphor), a discussion will necessarily arise about whether and to what extent the implied mapping does in fact preserve structure between the two domains. You could accept this state of affairs and provide empirical or theoretical arguments. Or you could dismiss the metaphorical nature entirely. But by doing so, you are also dismissing what is interesting about the metaphor, that is, the fact that there might be a morphism between two domains. We could for example redefine “algorithm” in a more general way as a computable function, even if it is not what is usually meant by that (as the Cormen textbook shows). But in that case, the claim loses all explanatory value because no structure at all is transported between the two domains. We are just calling sensory signals “input” and motor commands “output” and whatever happens in between “algorithm”. In mathematical terms, this is a mapping but not a morphism.</p>
<p>Thus, metaphors are interesting because they are morphisms between domains, which is what gives them scientific value (they are models). The problem, however, is that metaphor is typically covert, and failure to recognize them as such leads to dogmatism. When one objects to the use of some words like “code”, “algorithm”, “representation”, “optimization”, a common reaction is that the issue “is just semantic”. What this means is that it is just about arbitrary labels, and the labels themselves do not really matter. As if scientific discourse were essentially uninteresting and trivial (we just observe things and give them names). This reaction reveals a naïve view of language where words are mappings (between objects and arbitrary labels), when what matters is the structured concepts that words refer to through morphisms, not just mappings. This is what metaphor is about.</p>

Two popular theories, the Free Energy Principle aka Bayesian Brain and the Integrated Information Theory model, are singled out as examples of strong emergence-based work.

<p>"<a class="reference external" href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyProzZAW">The power of deeper networks for expressing natural functions (David Rolnick and Max Tegmark, 2018)</a>"</p>
<p>It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones. We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons m required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of n variables grows only linearly with n for deep neural networks, but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed. We also provide evidence that when the number of hidden layers is increased from 1 to k, the neuron requirement grows exponentially not with n but with n1/k, suggesting that the minimum number of layers required for practical expressibility grows only logarithmically with n."</p>

<p>We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2^n neurons in a single hidden layer."</p>

<p>The mainstream theory of economics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics">neoclassical economics</a>, is based on a very peculiar model of human behavior and social interactions. <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NeoclassicalEconomics.html">The core assumption</a> is that people’s behavior consists in maximizing “utility”, which is a measure of personal preferences. That is, each situation is assigned some utility and people choose the situation with maximal utility, by making the best possible use of available information. This is called “rational behavior” (this is somewhat related to the view in psychology that perceptual behavior is optimal, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs">which I have criticized</a> on similar grounds).</p>
<p>This model has been criticized repeatedly on empirical grounds, in particular on the grounds that humans are actually not that rational, psychology has documented numerous cognitive biases, and so on. This line of criticism forms an entire field, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics">behavioral economics</a>. Epistemologically, economics is quite a particular field because lack of empirical evidence for its core models or even direct empirical contradiction does not seem to be a problem at all. One reason is that the ambition of economic theory is not just empirical but also normative, i.e., it also has a political dimension. In other words, if reality does not fit the model, then reality should be changed so as to fit it (hence the prescription of free markets). It is of course questionable that theories can be called scientific if they constitutively offer no possibility of empirical grounding.</p>
<p>Thus, although the assumptions of neoclassical economics have been pretty much demolished on empirical grounds by psychology (actual behavior of people) and anthropology (actual social interactions; see for example David Graeber’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">Debt: The First 5000 Years</a>”), it still remains the dominant mode of economic thinking because it is intellectually appealing. Of course, political interference certainly has a role in this state of affairs, but here I want to focus on the intellectual aspects.</p>
<p>When the field of behavioral economics points out that humans actually do not behave “rationally”, those deviations are depicted as flaws or “bounds on rationality”. If you are not rational, then you are irrational. This is really not a radical criticism. We are bound to conclude that the rational agent is an approximation of real behavior, and everybody knows that a model cannot be exact. Perhaps the model could be amended, made more sophisticated, or perhaps we should educate people so that they are more rational (this seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>’s view). But fundamentally, “rational behavior” is a sensible, if imperfect, model of human behavior and social interactions.</p>
<p>What these criticisms miss is the fact that both “rational behavior” and “irrational behavior” have in common several implicit assumptions, which are not only empirically questionable but also absurd foundations for an economic theory – and which therefore cannot ground a normative approach any more than an empirical approach.</p>
<p>1) The first problem is with the idea of “rationality”. Rationality is something that belongs to the domain of logics, and therefore which can only be exerted on a particular model. Thus, to describe human behavior as “rational”, we must first assume that there exists a fixed model of the world and personal preferences, and that this model is not a subject of inquiry. In particular, personal preferences are given and cannot be changed. If, however, the advertisement business is not totally foolish, then this is wrong. Not only do personal preferences change, but one way of satisfying your own desires is by manipulating the desires of others, and this appears to be a large part of the activity of modern multinational companies. The fact that personal preferences are actually not fixed has two problematic consequences: 1) you cannot frame behavior as optimization if the optimization criterion is also a free parameter, 2) it becomes totally unclear how satisfying people’s preferences is supposed to be a good thing, if that means making them want what you sell, rather than selling them what they need; what preexisting economic problem is being solved in this way? Personal preferences can also be changed by the individual itself: for example she can decide, after reflection, that buying expensive branded clothes is futile (see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance theory</a> about how people change their preferences and beliefs). But again, if that possibility is on the table, then how can we even define “rational behavior”? is it to buy the expensive cloth or is it to change the “utility function”? Assuming preferences are fixed properties of people is the move that allows economic theory to avoid philosophical and in particular ethical questions (what is “good”? see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">buddhism</a>), as well as the possibility that people influence each other for various reasons (manipulation, but also conversation and education). Unfortunately those questions do not disappear just by ignoring them.</p>
<p>2) The assumption of “rationality” also assumes that people have a fixed model of the world over which that rationality is exerted. They do not learn, for example, and they do not need to be taught either. They just happen to know everything useful there is to know about the world. Building an adequate model of the world, of the consequences of one’s actions, is considered outside the realm of economic theory. But in a normative perspective, this is really paradoxical. One aim of economic theory is to devise efficient organizations of work, in particular which ensure the distribution of accurate information to the relevant people. But by postulating that people are “rational agents”, economic theory considers as already solved the problem it is supposed to address in the first place. In other words, the problem of designing rational organizations of production is dismissed by postulating that people are rational. No wonder that this view leads to the bureaucratization of economy (see David Graeber’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">Bullshit Jobs</a> and Béatrice Hibou’s <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137495273">The Bureaucratization of the World in the Neoliberal Era</a>).</p>
<p>3) Finally, implicit with the idea of “rational behavior” is caricatural reductionism. That is, the presumption that the optimization of individual preferences is realized at the individual level. This, in fact, amounts to neglecting the possibility that there are social interactions – quite problematic for a social science. A well-known example in game theory is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner’s dilemma</a>: two criminals are arrested; if they both remain silent, they will do one year in prison; if one betrays the other, he is set free and the other goes to jail for three years; if both betray the other, they both go to jail for two years. Whatever the other decides to do, it is always in your best interest to betray him: this would be the “rational behavior”. The paradox is that two “rational” criminals would end up in jail for two years, while two “irrational” criminals that would not betray each other would do just one year. Thus, “rationality” is not necessarily the most advantageous way to organize social interactions. Or to rephrase, individual rationality is not the same as collective rationality. This is of course a well-known problem in economy, in particular in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>” version. But again, this tends to be depicted as an amendment to be made to the core assumption of rationality (cf the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a>”), when it actually demonstrates the fallacy of the concept of “individual rationality”. Accordingly, neoclassical economists propose to solve the problem by incentives (e.g. carbon tax). But first of all, this is not the same as building collective infrastructures. And second, what this means is that anything that cannot be modeled as independent individual actions is not addressed by the economic theory, but instead must be tailored in the form of an “incentive structure”. Each collective problem now requires its own complex “incentive structure” designed in such a way that the “free” play of individual rationalities ensures the collective good, which is to say that each collective problem must be solved in an ad hoc way outside of the conceptual framework of theory. In other words, with its focus on “rational behavior”, neoclassical economics sets out to solve exclusively problems that do not involve social interactions. It is not clear, then, what the theory is meant to solve in the first place (how omniscient independent agents manage to organize themselves?), or to demonstrate (selfishness entails collective good, except when it doesn’t?).</p>
<p>This issue is actually an important theme of evolutionary theory. Namely, how can social species exist at all, if individualist behavior is rewarded by increased survival and reproduction rate? The answer that evolutionary theory has come to, as well as anthropology and ethology of social animals including primates (see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal">Frans de Waal</a>’s books), is that social animals display a variety of non-individualist behaviors based on altruism, reciprocity and authority, which ensure successful social interactions and therefore are beneficial for the species. In other words, studies in all those non-economic fields have concurred to demonstrate that efficient collective organizations are not based on individual rationality. This conclusion is not immensely surprising, yet it is essentially the opposite of mainstream economic theory.</p>
<p>In summary, the problem with the “rational behavior” model of human behavior that subtends neoclassical economics is not that people are “irrational”. The problem is that framing human behavior in terms of individual rationality already assumes from the outset that 1) people already have an accurate model of the world, and so no social organization is required to ensure that people’s actions have their intended consequences, this is already solved by people’s “rationality”; 2) people have preexisting fixed “preferences”, and so we don’t need to care about what a “good society” might mean, this is already taken care of by the “preferences”; 3) there is no collective rationality beyond individual rationality, and so there is in fact no society at all, just a group of independent people. Thus, the epistemological implications of the “rational behavior” model are in fact tremendous: essentially, the model amounts to putting aside all the problems that economic theory is supposed to solve in the first place. In other words, the “rational behavior” model of neoclassical economics is not just empirically wrong, it is also theoretically absurd.</p>

<p>p.s.: This is partially related to a recent discussion in perceptual psychology on the presumed optimality of human behavior. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485020">Rahnev &amp; Denison</a> (2018) review an extensive literature to show that in perceptual tasks, people are actually not optimal. These findings are referred to in the title as “suboptimality”, but in my view this is an unfortunate terminology. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs">My objection</a> to this terminology is that it implicitly accepts the framework of optimization, in which there already is a fixed model of the world for which we only need to tune the parameters. But this means ignoring what perception is largely about, namely modeling the world (object formation, scene analysis, etc).</p>

What, if anything, is the function of adult neurogenesis in humans? Does neurogenesis even exist in our adult brains, or does it shut down during childhood?

The debate over human neurogenesis has been one of the most prominent disputes in 21st century neuroscience. Just last year, two opposing papers appeared in leading journals, one claiming firm evidence of ongoing neurogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus, while the other study came to the opposite conclusion. The fact that adult neuro

<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have developed a novel technique capable of tracing intricate neural connections with unprecedented sensitivity</h4>
<p>With a bit of light, a few photo sensitive compounds and specialized paper, the blueprint was born. As the favored type of technical drawing for over a century, architects used this crucial tool for its fast reproducibility as well as its capacity for detailed documentation. For workers on a build site, the document was equally essential as it contained all the necessary design information, the specific types of components included, and served as a guide detailing how everything fit together. If there was ever any doubt, more often than not a quick consult with the blueprint resolved questions and progressed stalled construction forward.</p>
<p>But what happens when neuroscientists have questions about the brain and the intricate connections within? Is there even such a thing as a brain blueprint? Despite an ever-growing body of work uncovering how neurons in the brain form connections, researchers still lack a comprehensive diagram detailing their wiring. Establishing this would have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of the brain, uncovering how the unique circuitry of individual structures endow us with extraordinary abilities like language, sensory perception and cognition.</p>
<p>Taking the first step towards actualizing a blueprint of the brain, researchers from the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), have developed a novel technique capable of tracing intricate neural connections with unprecedented sensitivity. In a recent publication in Nature Neuroscience, researchers in the lab of Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, have demonstrated both the unparalleled specificity and high throughput nature of the approach. By innovatively combining cutting-edge genetic tools with the established technique of monosynaptic tracing, the Taniguchi Lab has created a powerful new tool named intersectional monosynaptic tracing (iMT), capable of unraveling the elaborate circuits within the brain.</p>

<p>Studying a specialized class of brain cell known as inhibitory interneurons, the Taniguchi Lab is interested in looking into how these diverse cells assemble into circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex. Normally, these cells act to refine, shape and balance information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Elucidating how these inhibitory circuits function, will pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. One challenging aspect hindering the elucidation of cortical circuits, is the sheer diversity of neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>Dr. Taniguchi explains, “While cellular diversity makes the brain so unique, it also conveys a great difficulty in the study of individual circuits. Take for instance the typical inhibitory circuit that we study in the lab; one excitatory principal neuron that transmits information over long distances from one brain region to another, and multiple inhibitory neurons that form connections with it. At first glance this model seems fairly simple but in reality, there are many diverse types of principal and inhibitory interneurons. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make very specific connections depending on a principal neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Without the ability to take a look at the specific connections formed by each subpopulation of inhibitory neuron, an accurate picture of the circuit cannot be formed.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Yetman, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Taniguchi Lab and first author of the paper notes that they wanted a technique that could cut through the cellular diversity of the brain, and only target specific subtypes of neurons. “This way, we could compare and contrast the connections of each unique subtype and study the types of circuits they form,” explains Yetman.</p>
<p>iMT was developed with this goal in mind, overcoming limitations of previously used methods to trace connections within the brain. Techniques such as electrical stimulation and monosynaptic tracing, were either too inefficient or lacked the sensitivity necessary to precisely trace connections from many different cell types found in the brain. iMT builds upon its predecessor, but with an innovative twist that is critical for conveying the technique’s sensitivity.</p>
<p>“Monosynaptic tracing utilizes a modified form of the rabies virus that lacks a necessary protein, restricting the virus to a single, starter cell and preventing infection of other cells around it,” explains Yetman. “But if the protein along with the virus is expressed in only the starter cell, then the virus has the ability to jump and infect nearby cells. For studying neurons within the brain, we can express the virus and protein in a principal neuron and watch as the virus jumps the synaptic connections to only the interneurons directly connected. Once there, the virus in a sense gets stuck without the necessary protein and tells the neuron to start expressing fluorescent protein. With microscopy, we can see the cells that are directly connected to our starter neuron. The limitation is that we could only visualize the connected interneurons as a whole, missing the unique properties of individual subtypes.”</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, the team has added an additional genetic component that reliably and specifically targets single subtypes of interneurons. Once the virus reaches a cell subtype that contains this component, a second new fluorescent protein is expressed. Now scientists have the ability to visualize the interneuron connections as a whole as well as connections of specific interneuron subtypes. Already iMT has proved groundbreaking, revealing dramatic differences in the interneuron circuit design of key inhibitory subtypes as well those of the same subtype that form connections with principal neurons of different brain areas.</p>
<p>“Though iMT is only in the first stages of development, it has the potential to provide a more detailed, brain-wide circuit diagram that will be essential for combating prominent brain disorders,” notes Yetman. “In the future we hope to further the technique to include the capability of studying the functional, and not just physical, connections of neural circuits.”</p>
<p>iMT and the neuroscientists at MPFI, are taking us one step closer to achieving the construction of a concrete cortical blueprint.</p>

<p>Epileptic seizures represent dysfunctional neural networks dominated by excessive and/or hypersynchronous activity. Recent progress in the field has outlined two concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as ‘primary generalized’ epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes. We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition. Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, focusing on circuit ‘choke points’ remote from the initiation site might be as important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure ‘focus’.</p>

<p>This January the<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://twitter.com/oupphilosophy"> OUP Philosophy</a> team honours the American psychologist and philosopher William James (1842-1910) as their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/category/arts-and-humanities/philosophy/philosopher-of-the-month/">Philosopher of the Month</a>. James is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of modern psychology.</p><p>James was born into a wealthy New York family in 1841, the son of a Swedenborg theologian, and the brother of the famous novelist, Henry James. He received a private education at home, and with the family made frequent trips to Europe. At the age of 18 he began his education as an artist and studied painting with the prominent American artist William Morris Hunt, but subsequently abandoned art. He went on to study chemistry and comparative anatomy at Harvard University before switching to Harvard Medical School in 1864 where he formed a lasting and important friendship with another philosopher, Charles Sanders Pierce. Although he graduated with a medical degree in 1869, he never practiced it.</p><p>Throughout his life, James was often subject to depressions and ill health. In 1870 he suffered a nervous breakdown which made him incapable of any work. In 1872, after his health had improved, he was offered the post to teach anatomy and physiology at Harvard by its president, Charles Eliot. In 1870 he expanded his teaching to include psychology and was instrumental in establishing the university’s psychology department and the first American experimental psychology laboratory. He then taught philosophy in 1879 and was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1885.</p><div><figure><img height="400" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/William_James_-_John_La_Farge.jpg" width="338" /><em>Image Credit: Portrait of William James by John La Farge, circa 1859, National Gallery.

He challenged the established psychological and philosophical thoughts of his day from the associationist school to the Hegelianism school by suggesting that the human experience was characterized by a “stream of consciousness”. He wrote in The Principles of Psychology, “Consciousness…does not appear to itself chopped up in bits…a ‘river’ or ‘stream’ are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described.” He also advanced a new theory of emotions which suggested that emotion follows, rather than causes, its physiological changes. According to him, external events cause bodily changes which we then feel. He asked what would grief be “without its tears, its sobs, its suffocation of the heart, its pang in the breast-bone?”. He also discussed emotions in relation to art. These are the “subtler emotions,” which are elicited from the aesthetic properties of the work of art. The book’s ideas drew attention from Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in Vienna and would influence generations of thinkers in Europe and America from Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and James Joyce and it remains one of the great classic texts of modern psychology.</p><p>James also wrote an influential work on the philosophy of religion. The Varieties of Religious Experience: a study in human nature (1902) examines different forms of religious experience from the point of view of a psychologist. James discussed human spirituality such as conversion, mystical experiences, and saintliness as well as his conception of the “healthy-mindedness” versus the “sick soul”. This supports his view that direct religious experiences rather than institutional religions form the foundation of religious lives: “the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in religion to whatever they may consider the divine.” In The Will to Believe (1897), he defended the place of religious beliefs by repudiating evidentialism and arguing that the belief in the divine existence can be justified by the emotional benefits it brings to one’s life. He recognized the role of science but suggested that there are elusive religious experiences which can only be accessed by individual human subjects but not sciences.</p><p>Along with Charles Sanders Peirce, James is credited as one of the founders of American pragmatism – a philosophy which holds that a belief or the truth of an idea is to be appraised in terms of its practical consequences, thus rejecting the quest for abstract foundational truths, traditional metaphysics, and absolute idealism. According to James, truth is to be found in concrete experiences and practices, and not in transcendental realities, “the true is only the expedient in the way of our thinking, just as the right is only the expedient in the way of our behaving” (Pragmatism: A New Name for some Old Ways of Thinking, 1907, p. 222).

<p>The<span><a href="http://www.maxplanckflorida.org/"> Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience</a></span> (MPFI) announces a new “labs@location” partnership agreement between the MPFI Electron Microscopy (EM) Core Facility and Germany-based microscopy company <span><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/home.html">ZEISS</a></span>, known for its cutting-edge imaging technologies. As a “labs@location” partner institution, MPFI will have access to state-of-the-art ZEISS technology before it is commercially available, providing researchers with innovative imaging tools that will empower their search for new insights into how the brain works. MPFI is the only the third institution in the United States to earn the labs@location designation.</p>
<p>“ZEISS and MPFI have a long-standing relationship—we have been closely cooperating to push the boundaries of visualizing the brain ultrastructure since MPFI was established in 2012,” said Dr. Naomi Kamasawa, Head of EM Facility. “Our facility might be small compared to other institutions, but the scientific excellence and technology feedback we provided, together with the continuous effort and passion to push boundaries in our research, made us a special partner for ZEISS.”</p>
<p>Kirk J. Czymmek, Head of the Global ZEISS Microscopy Customer Centers praised the EM Lab in his remarks, saying “The team that you have here is special, and they are internationally recognized for their expertise.”</p>
<p>MPFI and ZEISS launched the partnership on January 17, 2019 at an event that included lectures focused on Correlative Light-Electron Microscopy (CLEM), facility tours, and a partnership signing and reception held in MPFI’s Dreyfoos Atrium.</p>
<p>The first piece of equipment made available to MPFI scientists is known as the “Focal Charge Compensation module (FCC)”, which is integrated onto a Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscope system. The FCC introduces a local stream of nitrogen gas onto the sample inside the microscope, which absorbs unwanted electrical charges that interfere with imaging. “This new technology results in much higher quality images and allows us to collect data from even more challenging samples,” Dr. Kamasawa explained. “Anything that allows us to better visualize the structure of neurons and correlate it to their function will allow us to achieve a more complete understanding of neural networks, and ultimately, of the brain itself.” MPFI received the FCC equipment in August of this year, and was the first institution in the United States to use the technology after ZEISS made a number of significant improvements to the current commercially available model.</p>
<p>“The role of high-resolution imaging in unraveling the functional complexity of the brain cannot be overstated. This partnership is a great recognition of the unique know-how and research expertise provided by our electron microscopy facility. It underlines the importance of connecting core facilities, scientists and commercial partners, providing MPFI access to cutting edge technologies to push the boundaries of neuroscience research” said Dr. David Fitzpatrick, Scientific Director and CEO of MPFI.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>“Science is transitioning to utilizing 3D data sets and correlative microscopy, to this end we are pleased to partner with Max Planck Florida. These types of relationships are vital for us to better understand the issues and advantages of our hardware and software,” said James A. Sharp, President Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC.</p>
<p>In attendance were: Abdel Barraj, Head of Sales at ZEISS Microscopy North America; Kirk J. Czymmek, Head of the Global ZEISS Microscopy Customer Centers; Geoff Perumal, Academia Life Science EM/XRM Specialist at ZEISS Microscopy; Roger Unger, Regional Sales Manager, ZEISS; Oliver Tress, Systems Specialist, 3D Imaging, ZEISS; Robert Celestine, Area Manager, MICRO OPTICS OF FLORIDA, INC.</p>

<p>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have developed a new combination of technologies that allows them to identify the functional properties of individual synapses that link the two hemispheres and determine how they are arranged within a neuron’s dendritic field.</p>
<p>Each of the 20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex receives thousands of synaptic connections from other neurons, forming complex neural networks that make sensation, perception, movement, and higher cognitive functions possible.  Ultimately the function of these networks depends on events that occur within a neuron’s dendrite– extensions from the neuron’s cell body that resemble branches of a tree and receive synaptic connections from the axons of other neurons, A critical piece of the puzzle of cortical networks that continues to challenge neuroscientists is understanding the functional organization of synapses within a neuron’s dendritic field. This requires determining the functional properties of the synaptic inputs a neuron receives (<strong>what</strong> they are communicating), the source of the inputs (<strong>where</strong> they are coming from), and <strong>how</strong> they are arranged within the dendrite. <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31081-X"> In a new article in <em>Neuron</em></a>, MPFI researchers detail how they recently devised new methods to answer these questions, revealing a functional order to the arrangement of distant and local synaptic inputs within a neuron’s dendritic field that may play an important role in coordinating network activity.</p>
<p>Graduate student Kuo-Sheng Lee, along with other members of the Fitzpatrick lab, explored this question in the mouse visual cortex by mapping the synaptic inputs that link the two cortical hemispheres via a fiber bundle called the corpus callosum. This pathway is thought to play a critical role in coordinating the activity of the two cerebral hemispheres, and, for the visual system, unifying our binocular view of the world. They developed an approach that would permit them to visualize the individual dendritic spines of a neuron (small dendritic specializations that receive excitatory synaptic inputs), characterize their functional properties, and determine whether they receive callosal inputs.</p>
<p>To visualize the activity of individual dendritic spines, Lee et al., used an advanced imaging technique that relies on calcium signals that are detected as changes in fluorescence.  By watching the dendritic spines ‘light up’ with activity in the living brain, they could present different visual stimuli to the animal and determine which was most effective. The dendritic spines, like most of the cells in visual cortex, respond selectively to the orientation of edges in the visual scene, so this was the functional property they chose to define for each spine. Then to determine whether a spine received synaptic input from the callosum, Lee et al. used direct stimulation of the other hemisphere and looked to see which of the dendritic spines would light up.  Having found that a small percentage of spines were reliably and consistently activated by stimulating callosal inputs, then they were ready to address how are they were arranged within the dendritic field.</p>
<p>One interesting possibility was that the callosal inputs with similar orientation preference might be clustered together within the dendritic field.  Previous results had provided evidence for clustering of synaptic inputs by functional properties and suggested that coactivation of clustered inputs could amplify their impact on the neuron’s response.</p>
<p>But, when they performed the analysis, they found that close pairs of spines receiving callosal input were no more likely to have similar orientation preference than a random distribution of the spines within the dendritic field. Then they considered another possibility. Perhaps the callosal spines were clustered with non-callosal spines with the same orientation preference, bringing spines with distant and local inputs that have similar orientation preference into close proximity on the dendrite.  When they took pairs of close spines, one a callosal recipient and the other non-callosal recipient, and examined the orientation preference of the pairs, they were excited to find that they were they more similar to each other than would be expected by chance.</p>
<p>Lee et al. recognized that their conclusions would be strengthened if they could confirm the functional evidence for orderly local and callosal connectivity with another experimental approach: defining the synaptic connections anatomically. To accomplish this, they used a novel technique called expansion microscopy to anatomically visualize the nanoscale synaptic contacts with conventional light microscopy. The results were consistent with the functional stimulation results, demonstrating that callosal inputs and local inputs (derived from the region right around the targeted neuron) that exhibit similar or­ientation preference are clustered within the dendritic field.</p>
<p>These observations put the concept of functional clustering into a whole new context: ‘birds of a feather flock together’ <strong>and</strong> ‘opposites attract’.  Functional clustering represents a fine scale spatial pattern of specificity in connections within the dendritic field that can bring together inputs that have similar properties <strong>and</strong> are derived from different networks.  Combined with the evidence that functional clustering of spines in the dendritic field can amplify their impact on neuronal response, neurons in the visual cortex could use this strategy to generate robust responses to orientation-matched inputs from the two hemispheres, contributing to a seamless perception of the visual world. A similar structure may apply to callosal connections that link other areas of the cortex, a fine-scale organization of synapses within the dendrites of individual neurons that has ramifications for large-scale network function.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/how-belief-systems-handle-contradiction-i-empirical-contradiction/">How belief systems handle contradiction - (I) Empirical contradiction</a></h4>

<p>In this essay, I will discuss the different ways in which a theory can be contradicted, and how theories react. The scope of this discussion is broader than science, so I will be discussing belief systems, of which scientific theories are a particular kind (although, according to Feyerabend, not that particular). Another kind of belief system is political theories, for example. What is a belief system? Roughly speaking (and it will get more precise in the discussion), it is a set of propositions about the world that have a universal character. In science, this could be the law of gravitation, for example. Those propositions have relations with each other, and thus they form a system. For example, some propositions might logically imply others. In a belief system, there are generally core concepts over which other propositions build upon (examples: the atom; the rational agent of economic theory).</p>
<p>How do we evaluate belief systems? In philosophy of science, it is generally considered that scientific theories are evaluated empirically, by testing the empirical validity of propositions. That is, we evaluate the extent to which propositions are contradicted by facts. This has been the core target of much of modern philosophy of science, and thus I will start by recapitulating arguments about empirical contradiction, and add a few remarks. What has been less discussed is two other types of contradiction, social and theoretical. By social contradiction, I refer to the fact that at any given time, different people hold contradictory beliefs, even when they are aware of the same empirical body of observations. How is it possible and do such contradictions get solved? By theoretical contradiction, I refer to the possibility that a system is in fact not logically coherent. It seems that in philosophy of knowledge, belief systems are generally seen as a set of logically consistent propositions, but I will argue that this view is not tenable or rather is a normative view, and that belief systems actually are in some sense “archipelagos of knowledge”.</p>
<p><u>Empirical contradiction</u></p>
<p>Science is largely dominated by empiricism. One version of it is the logical empiricism of the circle of Vienna (or logical positivism), dating from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. In a nutshell, it claims that scientific statements are of two types: elementary propositions whose truth can be verified empirically, in other words observations, and propositions that can be logically deduced from those elements. This leads to a bottom-up view of science, where experimental scientists establish facts, and then theoreticians build consistent theories from these facts. As far as I can see in my own field, this view is still held by a large portion of scientists today, even though it has been pretty much demolished by philosophy of science in the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. To give an example, logical empiricism is the philosophical doctrine that underlies the logic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Brain_Project">Human Brain Project</a>, whose core idea is to collect measurements of the brain and then build a model from those.</p>
<p>Karl Popper objected that, on a logical ground, propositions can in fact never be verified if they have a universal nature. For example, to verify the law of gravitation, you would have to make all apples in the world fall, and you would still be unsure of whether another apple in the future might not fall in the way you expect. Universal propositions can only be <em>contradicted </em>by observations. This leads to falsificationism, the idea that scientific theories can only be falsified, not verified. On this view, at any given time, there are different theories that are consistent with the current body of experimental observations, and science progresses by elimination, by coming up with critical tests of theories. For example, one of the motivations advanced for collecting “big data” in neuroscience, such as the connectome, is that theories are presumed to be insufficiently constrained by current data (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3169">Denk et al., 2012</a>). This view is extremely popular in biology today, even though again later work in philosophy of science has also pretty much demolished it.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Quine (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism">Two dogmas of empiricism</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis">Duhem-Quine thesis</a>), we can object that a theory never gets tested directly, only models specific of a particular situation do. For example, if you wanted to test Newton’s laws, you could let an apple fall and measure its trajectory. But to do this, you would first need to come up with a model of the situation, where for example you would consider the apple as a point of a given mass subject to only the force of gravity. In this case, you would conclude that Newton laws are false. But you would have concluded differently if you had added an auxiliary assumption, that air also exerts a friction force on the apple, for which you would have to come up with a particular model.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">Kuhn</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">Lakatos</a> have pointed out that in fact, the way empirical contradictions are resolved is almost never by abandoning a theory. The process is rather one of <em>interpretation</em>, that is, of coming up with ways of making the observation congruent with the theory. This could be seen as a rhetorical maneuver, or as a fruitful scientific process. In this example, if you think that Newton laws are valid, then you would actually <em>deduce</em> the laws of friction from the empirical contradiction. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction">Laws of friction</a> are in fact very complicated in general and still an active field of research in physics, which draws on various domains of physics, and to make progress one has to accept the underlying theories.</p>
<p>The key point is to recognize that interpretation is not a flaw of the scientific process, but a logical necessity to confront a theory to reality. A theory is framed in the discrete structure of language, that is, in formal terms. For it to apply to anything in the world, things in the world must be mapped to the formal structure of the theory. This, in essence, is the process of modeling. In contrast with theory, a model does not have a universal character; it applies to a specific situation. In the example above, we would have to introduce the assumption that the apple is a rigid body, and that friction follows a particular law, for example that the friction force is proportional to speed. This implies that it is actually not possible to either verify or falsify a theory on the basis of an empirical observation.</p>
<p>This argument does not lead to a relativistic view (all theories have the same epistemic value and it is a question of taste); in this, I would temper some of the conclusions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend">Feyerabend</a>. Interpretation is in fact not only a logical necessity, but also a key element in scientific progress. Lakatos proposed that it is not theories that compete, but research programs. Some research programs are “degenerate”: they evolve by adding heteroclite ad hoc hypotheses to account for each new observation. Others are “progressive”: they evolve by extending their theoretical core, which then applies to new situations. In scientific practice, this is obtained by dissolving the specific character of interpretations into the universal character of theories. To come back to the apple example, initially we would interpret the empirical contradiction by coming up with an empirical model of friction, which essentially amounts to calling the empirical error “friction”. More precisely, it is an auxiliary hypothesis that makes the observation compatible with the theory. But this could then be turned into theoretical progress: from an analysis of a number of cases of falls of objects, we could then postulate that there is a friction force that is proportional to the speed of the apple and to its size (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">Stokes law</a>). By doing so, we make parts of the previous interpretations instances of a new theoretical proposition. Note that this proposition only makes sense in the context of Newton’s laws, and thus we are indeed describing a system and not just a set of independent laws. The evaluative situation of the apple fall has now changed: we are evaluating a broader theoretical body (Newton’s laws + Stokes law) by using a narrower interpretative model (the apple is a rigid sphere).</p>
<p>Thus, interpretation is a key feature of belief systems, both logically necessary and progressive, and it appears to be neglected by the two flavors of empiricism that are broadly observed in science (verificationism and falsificationism). Yet without it, it is impossible to understand why people can disagree, other than by postulating than some must be either idiots or liars. I will address this issue in the next part on social contradiction.</p>
<p>So far, I have argued that scientists face empirical contradiction by interpretation. Theoretical progress is then made by dissolving interpretations into new theory. What this really means is that the very notion of “empirical contradiction” is in fact quite misleading, because for the person doing the interpretative work, there is no real contradiction, only a more complex situation than expected. I will end this part by drawing on developments of psychology, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance theory</a>, and extending to non-scientific situations.</p>
<p>Resolving empirical contradiction by interpretation is not at all specific of science, but is a general feature of how people confront their beliefs to facts. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails">When Prophecy Fails</a>, Leon Festinger and colleagues infiltrated a UFO sect that believed in an imminent apocalypse, and they examined what happened when the predicted end of the world did not happen. Believers did not at all abandon their belief. Instead, the leader claimed that they had managed to postpone the end of the world thanks to their prayers, and she proposed a new date. This is a case of interpretation of the observation within the belief system. But importantly, as discussed above, interpretation is not a flaw of human nature, but a necessary feature of belief systems. In this case, the believers appear to have arbitrarily made up an ad hoc justification, and we are tempted to dismiss it as a hallmark of irrational thinking. But when observe the anomalous trajectory of Jupiter and, to make up for this anomaly, we postulate that there must be an unobserved satellite orbiting around the planet, we are making an interpretative move of the same nature, except in this case it turns out to be correct. Our initial reaction in the former case is that any reasonable person should reject the theory if the prediction is directly contradicted, yet in the latter case we find the same attitude reasonable. In reality, the main difference between the two cases is not in the way empirical contradictions are handled, but in the perceived plausibility of both the prediction and the interpretation. Specifically, we do not believe that prayers can have any visible effect at all and thus the interpretative move appears irrational. But of course, the situation is quite different if the powers of prayer have a prominent role in our belief system. Thus, it is an error to describe the ad hoc interpretation as irrational. It is actually totally rational, in that it follows from logical reasoning (A, the end of the world should have occurred if we had not intervened; B, we have prayed; C, prayers have an impact; conclusion: the end of the world has probably be been prevented by our prayers). Only, rationality is applied within a highly questionable theoretical framework. In the end, we realize that it is not really the non-occurrence of the end of the world that should lead us to abandon the belief system, but rather the empirical contradictions of the belief system in its globality, for example the fact that prayers actually do not work.</p>
<p>Thus, it should not be surprising that in their field study, the authors find that it takes a number of failed end-of-the-world predictions before the beliefs are finally abandoned. This is what Imre Lakatos called a “degenerative research program”: the theory survives repeated contradictions only by making up an incoherent series of ad hoc assumptions. It ends up being overthrown, but the process can take a very long time (this process of change between scientific theories is well documented also by Thomas Kuhn’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The structure of scientific revolutions</a>).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is particularly visible in political discourse. Any significant political event or observation will be given a different interpretation depending on the political preferences of the person. It never happens that a right wing person turns left wing upon noticing that wealthy countries have many homeless people. Rather, an interpretation is made that revolves around the notion of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>To give a contemporary example, recent demonstrations in France have been met by an extraordinarily repressive response, with hundreds of serious injuries caused by police, some on journalists and children, which are documented by hundreds of videos circulating on social media (see @davduf and a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/01/16/maintien-de-l-ordre-le-lourd-bilan-des-lanceurs-de-balle-de-defense_5409630_1653578.html">recent article in Le Monde</a>). A recent one is a 47 year old voluntary fire man, father of three, who was demonstrating with his wife until they were dispersed by tear gas. He was later found lying alone in an empty street with a head injury, and an amateur video shows that police shot him in the head from behind with a flash-ball gun and launched a grenade in the street. The man is currently in a coma. In any of those cases, on social media there is invariably part of the comments that suggest that the man or woman must have done something bad (this is indeed the official doctrine, as the Minister of Interior has recently claimed that he is not aware of any case of police violence). It is not in itself irrational: simply, the commenter presumes that police do not hurt innocent citizens, deduces that the citizen involved is not innocent, and concludes that the critics are irrational conspiracy seekers.</p>
<p>There are indeed conspiracy theorists, for example those that claim that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories">landing on the moon was in fact filmed</a> in Hollywood studios. The fact that it is a conspiracy theory is not itself a reason to discredit it, since there have been conspiracies in History. The theory itself is also not irrational, in that it has logical coherence as well as empirical elements of support. For example, on the video the American flag appears to float in the wind whereas there can be no wind on the moon and in fact the flag should appear folded. Indeed: the flag was made rigid precisely for that reason. But most people do not know this fact, and thus the reasons why the ordinary citizen believes that man actually did land on the moon is that she trusts the source and finds the information plausible. Which attitude is irrational?</p>
<p>These examples illustrate several points. First, isolated empirical contradictions almost never shake a belief system. In fact, this is precisely what we mean when we say that “<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence">extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</a>”. This proposition, however, is quite misleading since the notion of what is extraordinary is specific of a particular belief system. There is no objective definition of “extraordinary”. Therefore, rather than being a normative feature of scientific method, it simply expresses the inherent conservativeness of belief systems. As Festinger’s study shows, it can take a large number of empirical contradictions to impact a belief system. As explained previously, this is not necessarily a flaw as those contradictions can (sometimes) be turned into theoretical progress within the belief system.</p>
<p>But there are other ways in which empirical contradictions are handled by belief systems, which are documented in psychology by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance theory</a>. A major one is simply to avoid being confronted to those contradictions, for example by reading newspapers with the same political views, or by discrediting the source of information without actually examining the information (e.g. social media propagate fake news, therefore the video cannot be trusted). Another is proselytism, that is, trying to convert other people to your belief system.</p>
<p>These mechanisms explain that at any given moment, mutually contradictory belief systems are held by people who live in the same world and are in contact with each other, and who can even discuss the same empirical observations. The conclusion of our discussion is that the main problematic issue in belief systems is not so much irrationality as dogmatism (but we will come back to irrationality in the third part on theoretical contradiction). Dogmatism arises from two different attitudes: blindness and deafness. Dogmatism is blind in that it actively refuses to see empirical evidence as potentially contradictory: it is not just that it is contradicted by empirical observations (this very notion is questionable), but rather that it dismisses empirical contradiction without seriously trying to accommodate for it in a progressive way (i.e., by strengthening its theoretical core). Dogmatism is deaf in that it refuses to acknowledge for the possibility that other rational belief systems can exist, and may have diverging interpretations of the empirical body of observations. Dogmatism denies the theoretical possibility of disagreement: the opponent is always either an idiot (irrational) or a liar (has ulterior motives). In the next part, I will turn to social contradiction: how different belief systems can co-exist and influence each other.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9811">A Scientific Song of Consciousness and Self</a></h4>

In what may be a world first, a peer-reviewed journal, Frontiers in Psychology, has published a song.



The musical contribution to science is called 'It's Hard Work Being No One', and it comes from psychologist J. Scott Jordan of the Illinois State University. Here's some of the lyrics, which deal with nothing less than the existential question of identity:
I got a ticket on the next train to OZ

Do you believe that people's eyes emit an invisible beam of force?

According to a rather fun paper in PNAS, you probably do, on some level, believe that. The paper is called Implicit model of other people’s visual attention as an invisible, force-carrying beam projecting from the eyes.



To show that people unconsciously believe in eye-beams, psychologists Arvid Guterstam et al. had 157 MTurk volunteers perform a computer task in which they had to judge the angle at which paper tubes wou

<h4>Time to torch the textbooks</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v489KmVg2nP9MDfsu9i3pw.png" /></figure><p>Welcome all to the third annual review of the year in neuroscience from The Spike. We’ve made it to the end of 2018. Who saw that coming?</p><p>Which means it’s time to take stock, and admire the great strides we’ve made in understanding the brain this year. Pfft. There, done that. Now for the actual review, this year a sampling of three pieces of beautiful or provocative work that shows us we understand less than we thought.</p><h4>1/ Neurons “transmit” RNA</h4><p>January started with a bang: Jason Shepherd and his team <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31504-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417315040%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">published a paper </a>showing that messenger RNA (mRNA) is transmitted between neurons. I’ll say right upfront that molecular biology is not one of my strengths. But then neither is elephant juggling, and I gave that a damn good try until the hernia. And the findings in this paper are so outlandish that if you missed it then, you need to know about it know.</p><p>It all starts with the Arc gene, and the protein it encodes. We know Arc is needed for learning. Delete the Arc gene in mice and learning is screwed. The Arc gene shows up in those big fishing expeditions for genes related to disorders of learning and development. And for once we even know something about what the Arc protein does — it’s involved in building synapses, possibly by moving AMPA receptors into position.</p><p>So far, so genetics. The Arc gene is read-out by a string of Arc mRNA, which in turn specifies an Arc protein, and the Arc protein alters synapses. A lot of mechanism, but no function. That mucking about with a gene that affects synapses in turn affects learning is a bit of no-brainer. We already know a lot about when and why synapses between neurons get weaker or stronger; knowing this gene-to-protein pathway gives us a better understanding of how synapses get stronger or weaker, but doesn’t tell us a lot more about the why or when. As systems neuroscientists we only get out of bed for something that tells us about how neurons talk to each other.</p><p>It turns out neurons can talk to each other using Arc. I’m out of bed now.</p><p>The Shepherd lab’s paper in January showed that the Arc protein makes a virus-like shell, and inside this shell is wrapped Arc’s own mRNA — the mRNA that encodes the protein itself. This shell is then in turn shoved in the kind of bag — a vesicle — that neurons use to transmit stuff to each other at synapses. Except this type of vesicle isn’t released at a synapse, its simply released from wherever on the neuron’s skin it happened to form.</p><p>The big question the Shepherd lab then faced down was: if this bag containing a bit of Arc’s mRNA is released outside the neuron, does it get taken up by other neurons? And if it does get taken up, what does it do? They tackled this in a really elegant way. Take a bunch of neurons in a dish that have no Arc in them, as it’s been knocked-out. Then dump some of those Arc mRNA filled bags into that dish, special ones that have been altered to glow. And watch: do the glowing bags end up inside the neurons? Yes, they did.</p><p>And the clincher was when Shepherd’s team then looked inside these Arc-less neurons, now filled with glowing bags, and found huge quantities of the Arc protein. The mRNA had been taken up, and proteins manufactured from it.</p><p>The ramifications of this work are potentially huge. For one thing, we have this startling evidence of non-canonical transmission between neurons. But more important is what was transmitted: this is a neuron sending a recipe for how to construct a protein to another neuron. A protein that is heavily involved in controlling learning. We now have evidence that internal instructions to change one neuron’s synapses can be sent to other nearby neurons, and potentially change theirs too. Understanding how neurons learn just got a whole lot more complicated.</p><p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31502-7">the same thing happens in flies too</a>.</p><h4>2/ Who watches the watch-people?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j9etcIMb-wa1qU5JqSKo3w.png" /></figure><p>Say I was the annoying kind of father who doled out sweets one at a time in a slow tedious game for my own amusement. I’ve got a bowl of sweets and grapes all mixed together, and a 5 year old who would very much like a sweet, actually daddy. So the game goes as follows — I look in the bowl, and pick something out and show it to the irritated child. With my left hand I always take and show a grape, with my right hand a chocolate; I repeat that pick-and-show a few times to hammer home the message. Then I pick one item in each fist so they can’t see, and ask my 5 year old to choose a hand to open. Which would they pick? Right hand, yes?</p><p>But if I then put both hands in the bowl without looking in the bowl, which would they pick? If my 5 year old understood how the world works, then they now know that I was not able to see what I chose — so they should pick a hand at random. Or yell for mummy to get daddy to pack in this idiotic game.</p><p>To pick a hand, the 5 year old needs some pretty advanced knowledge of what others know — a model of the world that includes inferring what others themselves know about the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30549-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218305499%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work by Johanna Eckert and colleagues</a> this year showed chimps have exactly this knowledge — about humans.</p><p>Each chimp had to deal with two such annoying humans. Two buckets were in view, both mixes of carrots and peanuts; one heavy on the carrots, one heavy on the peanuts. The buckets were transparent, so the chimp could see which was carrot-heavy, and which peanut-heavy. The humans deliberately picked the rare options: Human 1 picked peanuts from the carrot-heavy bucket; Human 2 picked carrots from the peanut-heavy bucket. Each showed these picks to the chimp.</p><p>After showing this a few times, and presumably as the chimp grew tired of these annoying humans and their tedious game, then came the test. On some trials, the humans looked in the bucket as they were picking. On other trials, the could not see the bucket, and picked blindly. The chimp could see all this. On each trial it was offered both fists, and asked to choose one. Which did it choose?</p><p>The tension here is between the chimp’s knowledge of what is in the buckets, and the knowledge of what the humans know. The chimp knows which bucket is full of carrots (ugh) and which is full of peanuts (woohoo!). But it may also know that Human 1 keeps picking peanuts from the carrot bucket, and Human 2 irritatingly picks carrots from the peanut bucket. So if it knew this, then the chimp should choose the fist of Human 1 and collect its peanut.</p><p>Ah, but wait: if Humans 1 and 2 did not look into the bucket, then surely it was more likely that Human 1 now has a carrot and Human 2 now has a peanut, because that’s what their buckets were filled with. In which case, the chimp should choose the fist of Human 2, as they were more likely to have a peanut.</p><p>Amazingly, the chimps worked all this out. On trials where the humans looked into the buckets, the chimps chose the fist of Human 1 — the peanut picker — vastly more often than chance. On trials where the humans could not see into the buckets, and picked at random, the chimps chose the fist of Human 2 more often. The chimps’ choices reflected not only their knowledge of the world, but also what they inferred the humans knew about the world. And used this knowledge to adjust the probability of their decisions.</p><p>Face it, a chimp is a better statistician than you.</p><h4>3/ Misplaced childhood</h4><p>You remember when you were one, charging about the place with a very full nappy (diaper, if you insist), slipped, and landed so hard on your bum that the nappy lost containment and the resulting pooh tsunami covered Grandma? No? Well, that’s because of infant amnesia — we lay down no long term memories of our early childhood.</p><p>Infant amnesia seems fairly self-evident: we cannot remember anything about our early childhood, so there must be no memory stored in our brain. Or is it? For what if instead we simply can’t access the memories. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30695-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221830695X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work from Paul Frankland’s lab</a>, led by Axel Guskjolen, has now shown us that actually there may well memories of your infancy still in there somewhere.</p><p>Mice can’t remember stuff from their early childhood either. Frankland’s lab showed this by testing a mouse’s memory for fear of a bad place — put a mouse in a special box, apply a mild electric shock, repeat a couple of times. Then next day put it back in that box, and the mouse freezes, remembering the box, what it means, and anticipating a shock.</p><p>Do this to adult mice — 60 days old — and that memory lasts for more than 90 days. They freeze just as much if put back into the box after 90 days as they do after one day — even if they’ve never seen the box in the intervening 89 days. They have a clear memory of the bad place that lasts for longer than they’d been alive when they first saw it. Pretty convincing long-term memory.</p><p>But do this to infant mice — 14 days old — and all memory of the bad place is gone by 15 days later. Put them back in the box after 30 days, say, and no freezing at all. Is the memory gone, or hidden?</p><p>We know that the hippocampus is strongly involved in these kinds of place memories. So it’s a great candidate for finding the memory of the bad place. Frankland’s lab took the elegant approach of injecting into the hippocampus a gene that tags neurons when they are active. The idea here was that neurons laying down the memory during training in the bad place will be most active, so will be the most strongly tagged. The crucial part is that the tagging causes the neurons to express a light-sensitive ion channel. Then if you were to later shine a laser into that same part of hippocampus, the laser will re-activate just those tagged neurons. In theory, re-activating whatever those neurons represent.</p><p>Frankland’s lab did just this in their 14 day old mice: tagged the active neurons while training them to learn about the bad place. When they put them back in the box after 15 days, they did not freeze, showing no memory, as expected. But then the laser in hippocampus was switched on: and the mice froze. Just as though re-activating the tagged neurons switched on a lost memory of the bad place.</p><p>As with all good scientists, the team did a lot of control experiments to make this convincing. They turned the laser on without tagging the neurons, and no freezing. They tagged the neurons, but only turned the laser on in other locations, like their cage, not the special box: and no freezing. This control is actually very important. Activating so many neurons in hippocampus at the same time could cause an epilepsy-like absence seizure, where the mice would freeze in place. But as the freezing was only in the bad place, and not wherever the laser was switched on, that’s pretty convincing evidence that freezing in the bad place wasn’t just a seizure.</p><p>Activating the tagged neurons still worked after 30 days between training and testing. It worked after 60 days. An infant mouse’s memory of what happened in the bad place could be turned back on at will. It was there, but they could not access it. Which opens up the slightly worrying idea that infant amnesia is not the erasure of memory, but the hiding of memory.</p><h4>Plan S</h4><p>If we’re going to discuss science in 2018, I suppose we have to mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S">Plan S</a>. A bold plan to get published works from across the European Union freely and immediately available for all to read. And to do get the plan launched in a mere couple of years. A worthy idea, but one that caused no end of arguing.</p><p>From one perspective, this is a long-needed action, whether you believe that science paid for by taxpayers should be available to those taxpayers, or that the vast profits of scientific publishing houses are obscene. From another perspective, this is a draconian laying down of the law, with a narrow, muddled view of what constitutes open-access (no pre-prints, no free access with a short delay), and little thought for institutions that depend on revenue from publishing journals for their existence (such as learned societies). Who is right?</p><p>Everyone, of course. We need a Plan S of some kind; the version we got was not thought through well enough before being announced. Prioritising paid-for open-access over all others risks giving more, not less, power to established publishers. And I saw strangely little discussion of the UK’s long experience with our own version of Plan S: we’ve had mandated gold open-access publication of work funded by our Research Councils since 2014, when a central fund was established to pay for it (and the Wellcome Trust made a similar mandate with their own money). Each university is given its share of this central fund each year, with a simple mission: pay for each paper funded by the Research Councils to be published “open to all”.</p><p>Result? With no caps on how much journals will charge to publish an open-to-all paper, this costs an absolute fortune . The funds held by each university are rapidly run down each financial year. To stem the flood, some universities put their own local rules in place about what kinds of paper will qualify for funding (e.g. no funds for hybrid journals) so there are big inconsistencies between universities in how they implement this apparently simple policy. Worse, some universities simply run out of funding, and turn down the mandated requests for pay for papers. In short, an expensive mess.</p><p>I look forward to the Plan S architects answering the simple question: if implemented, where will people publish when the money runs out?</p><h4><strong>Hey, 2018 wasn’t all bad.</strong></h4><p>We had Peter Dayan and Demis Hassabis elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, in recognition of their ground-breaking work in artificial intelligence and neuroscience. <a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut/">DeepLabCut </a>brought automated, general purpose movement tracking to the masses.<br />We got compelling evidence that the tiny groups of mid-brain neurons housing the brain’s key neuromodulators are home to extraordinary diversity, in a flurry of papers within what seemed a week of each other, on <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30971-1#.W3_cq2FUTcg.twitter">serotonin</a>, on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0203-4">dopamine</a>, and on <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30635-4">noradrenaline</a>.</p><p>Hugo Spiers and colleagues <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30771-1">showed us</a> that the difference in navigation ability between the men and women of a country correlates rather stunningly well with the level of gender inequality in that country: the more unequal the genders are treated, the bigger the gap in the ability to navigate. To the extent that countries with minor gender inequality — your Norways and your Finlands — show no difference in navigation ability between men and women.</p><p>And it would be remiss of me not to mention that <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> itself had an exciting year, as it morphed from one-man show to a platform for a rich variety of voices in systems neuroscience.

December brought us an issue of <em>Nature</em> with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0716-8">a really strange neuroscience paper</a>. A paper about the role of hippocampus in memory. Unlike most strange papers, this one was strange for what was <strong>not</strong> in it. No flashy genetics; no tricksy optogenetics to make neurons do unworldly things; no DREADDs to control specific neurons with designer chemicals; no Neuropixels or calcium imaging to record hundreds or thousands of neurons; no unit recording of any kind, in fact. Just behaviour, chemical lesions for causality, and EEG/LFP to track sleep states. Like something from the late 80s. As were the statistical analyses (seriously <em>Nature</em>, bar charts with single sided error bars in 2018?).</p><p>But it made an interesting case for scientific insight, and there it is, in <em>Nature</em>. Freak occurrence, or turning point to prizing scientific insight over flash? Onwards to 2019 to find out. See you there!</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>End of year festivities are now in full swing with our focus on friends, family and food. In this blog, I look at how diet can affect your mental health, and share some healthy eating tips to get you through the silly season without the mood swings and guilt.</p>
<h2>Does diet affect mental health?</h2>
<p>If you’re in a negative mood, you’re more likely to choose indulgent, comfort foods that are sugary, fatty or salty instead of opting for nutritious options.</p>
<p>We have anecdotal evidence to support the notion that how you feel affects the foods you choose to eat.</p>
<p>Until recently, what was less understood was the causal relationship between food and how it affected mood.</p>
<h2>The SMILES trial – evidence at last!</h2>
<p>Associate Professor Felice Jacka, Deakin University researcher and founder of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry, and her team have recently conducted a small <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y">clinical trial</a> of 67 people suffering symptoms of depression and found a link between diet and their mental health.</p>
<p>In the study, half of the participants were encouraged to follow a Modified Mediterranean Diet, which was constructed using existing dietary guidelines from Greece and Australia, <em>traditional</em> Mediterranean diet principles. Everyone was coached by a dietician. A comparison group of people with the same symptoms, were offered social support only.</p>
<p>The results of the <a href="https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/media/smiles-trial/">SMILES study,</a> published in the international journal <em>BMC Medicine</em>, showed that participants in the dietary intervention group had a much greater reduction in their depressive symptoms over the three-month period, compared to those in the social support group.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, a third of those in the dietary support group met criteria for remission of major depression, compared to 8 percent of those in the social support group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnfirstbite/diet-for-mental-health/5802234" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacka says</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Research now suggests that depression and dementia are affected by the quality of our diets across the life course. Research also shows that adults who eat more unhealthy junk foods are at increased risk of depression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also the case in teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see a pretty clear dose-response relationships between their diet and level of mental health and wellbeing. In particular, those that had low scores on what we call an unhealthy dietary pattern were worse off, and those who had a higher score on the nutrient-dense dietary pattern were better off.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>What foods should I choose to improve mood?</h2>
<p>The ‘bad-mood food’ culprits are what you might expect. As Jacka <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2014/10/02/4098166.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Highly-processed snack and takeaway food products, rich in tasty fat and sugar, have now displaced much of the fruit, vegetables and other nutritious, unprocessed foods in our diets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy, nutrient-dense dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, seem to protect against developing depression, and also dementia. Jacka says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The strongest evidence-base we have is for the Mediterranean diet, and it is what we should be advocating for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A Mediterranean type diet (which is <em>not</em> red wine based!) is characterised by high consumption of plants (vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains), is rich in healthy fats from generous consumption of fish and olive oil, is low in red meat and dairy, and allows for moderate consumption of red wine with meals.</p>
<h2>Tips for healthy eating over the festive season.</h2>
<p>Tis the season to be jolly!</p>
<p>Here are some easy brain-healthy choices you can make to keep you feeling joyful at your next BBQ or end of year party:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of only snacking on chips, try a few raw nuts too (just not the salted and roasted kind!).</li>
<li>Load up your plate with salad or veggies first — you’ll leave less room for meat, bread or potatoes.</li>
<li>Swap the BBQ lamb chop or steak for salmon. Omega-3 fats in fish reduce inflammation, which may contribute to an increased risk of depression or anxiety.</li>
<li>Add some legumes (beans, chickpeas or lentils) to your plate. Your gut will love the extra fibre, and evidence is building that a healthy gut microbiome is linked to better mental health.</li>
<li>High-quality extra-virgin olive oil seasoned with balsamic vinegar is delicious for dipping wholegrain bread, and is a healthy alternative to butter or margarine.</li>
<li>Enjoy prawns and turkey. Both are rich in tryptophan an essential amino acid that is the precursor for the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) serotonin.</li>
<li>Swap the pavlova for fresh fruit (or at least choose both!). Or, if you must indulge, save the sweet treats for a special occasion like Christmas day.</li>
<li>Cheers! Enjoy a glass of red wine with friends and family. Social connection is one of the best protective factors against mental health problems and cognitive decline.</li>
</ul>

This time last year I wrote(1,2) about a Swedish company called Emotra. Emotra make a device that is supposed to measure suicide risk in people with mental illness. The test is called EDOR® and according to Emotra's website and materials, it has been shown to be highly effective. Last year, I explained why I disagree with that assessment.



Now, a year later, I'm revisting the EDOR® story, because there have been a number of developments that I find quite disturbing. It seems that EDOR® has

<p>When I was in medical school, my fellow students and I all dreaded a single course, taught then in the second year—neuroanatomy. At my school, we had two famous neuroanatomy professors who had written competing textbooks on the subject and clearly disliked each other. One was known to be eccentric and the other mean. But the reason we dreaded the course was that we knew it would challenge the human capacity for memorization to the absolute limit. And given how many things a medical student is required to memorize, we were frightened.</p><p>The brain is comprised of about 80 billion neurons and an equal number of three other types of cells: astroglial cells, oligodendroglial cells, and microglial cells. The neurons send out processes called axons that connect with dendrites on other neurons, forming trillions of connections called synapses. Some axons travel distances of only millimeters while others run for several feet from the brain to other parts of the body. Within the brain, there are many different substructures, each connected by axons and dendrites to multiple other substructures. In the 1970’s, neuroanatomy courses meant memorizing something that looked as complicated as the New York City subway map.</p><figure><img height="759" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brain.jpg" width="501" /><em>The human brain has approximately 80 billion neurons and trillions of synaptic connections.

Hitting a pathway in another part of the brain meant losing the ability to understand, but not generate speech. If you cut the nervous supply at the level of the spinal cord in a particular spot, a person would no longer be able to feel a pinprick to the front of the right thigh, but vibration to that area would not be affected. We sat up long nights, often in groups, trying to remember all of this because that is what we would be asked about on the many tests our two professors loved to give.</p><p>Through all of this, we were too scared and exhausted memorizing the names of brain regions and pathways to ask a fundamental question: if the brain is laid out like a fixed series of subway stations and tracks, how is it that we can learn something new? It must be the case that something is capable of changing somewhere in the brain to accommodate the fact that we continue to learn and remember things through our lives.</p><p>Indeed, thanks to Eric Kandel, who became a professor at my medical school after I had graduated and joined the faculty myself, and to many other neuroscientists through the second half of the twentieth century, we learned that the brain is an incredibly adaptive, plastic organ, capable of responding and changing every time we see something new, learn a new fact, or experience a new emotion. Yes, our brains are programmed by genes that tell neurons where to go as it develops in utero, but those same genes are turned on and off throughout life whenever we have an experience. After all, even the ancient New York City subway system is subject to change; we just got a brand new line on Second Avenue and new cars are continuously being added to existing lines.</p><p>Unfortunately, that also means that adverse life experiences can damage the brain. Studies continue to show that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27439-5">traumatic early life experiences lead to reductions in brain volume in certain key areas of the central nervous system</a>. Early life adversity also changes the strength of connections among various brain regions and the degree to which groups of neurons are activated throughout life.</p><div><figure><img height="353" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gorman-2.jpg" width="495" /><em>A scientific illustration of how epigenetic mechanisms can affect health. Image credit: Public Domain via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commonfund.nih.gov/epigenomics/figure">National Institutes of Health</a>.</em></figure></div><p>Changes in gene activation in the brain occur in part through a process called epigenetics (below). Although we are born with most of the DNA sequences in our genes we will ever have, molecules such as methyl and adenyl groups bind to our DNA or the proteins that surround DNA and alter the expression of those genes. For example, one recent study showed that epigenetic modifications of a receptor for the brain neurotransmitter <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0222-7">dopamine have an effect on IQ scores</a>.</p><p>Because traumatic early life experiences clearly predispose people to developing psychiatric illnesses like depression, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia, scientists have spent the most time examining the effects of stressful life events on brain function in both laboratory animals and humans. But positive experiences—indeed, each and every experience—affects brain function. And that means that it is possible that a positive life experience like a successful course of psychotherapy might be able to<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915238/"> reverse structural and functional abnormalities in the human brain. </a></p><p>In the last half-century, we have come an enormous distance in understanding that the brain is not an organ whose functions are written in stone, but rather a dynamic collection of genes, molecules, cells, and pathways, all of which are modified on a second-by-second basis. So far, we have the most information about the profound ways that early life adversity affects brain structure and function, and that information is proving extremely useful in developing new ways to intervene with psychiatric illnesses, both with medications and psychotherapy. As research develops, we will also learn more about how to reinforce the effects of positive life experiences on the brain.</p><p>Of course, this new information about the brain makes it even more complex than we originally thought, so studying neuroscience in medical school (instead of just neuroanatomy) may still be scary to students. But it is now far more interesting than it was for me.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: Nerve Cell by ColiN00B.

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/epistemologie-politique-i-introduction/">Epistémologie politique (I) Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Dans cette série, je m’intéresse à l’épistémologie de la pensée politique. J’entends ici par épistémologie la théorie de la connaissance de manière générale, c’est-à-dire pas seulement la connaissance scientifique mais la connaissance du monde, plus généralement. Dans la pensée politique, il y a bien sûr un aspect normatif (comment la société devrait être organisée et dans quel but) mais cette normativité prend toujours appui sur une théorie du monde : comment fonctionnent la société, l’économie, les structures de pouvoir. Elle inclut également toujours un certain nombre de présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Par exemple, selon une théorie typiquement associée à la droite conservatrice, l’homme est un loup pour l’homme (Hobbes) ; il s’ensuit que des institutions doivent être créées pour protéger l’homme de ses congénères. Une variante (droite libérale) est que l’homme cherche avant tout à maximiser à son intérêt personnel ; il s’ensuit que les institutions sociales doivent être organisées de façon à ce que l’intérêt personnel coïncide avec l’intérêt collectif. Selon une autre théorie ancrée à gauche, l’homme est naturellement altruiste (Rousseau) ; il s’ensuit que la société doit être organisée pour faciliter la coopération entre les hommes (avec bien sûr de nombreuses variantes ; anarchismes, communismes, etc).</p>
<p>Ainsi les doctrines politiques sont en grande partie déterminées par des théories sous-jacentes de l’homme et du monde. Par conséquent, les désaccords politiques sont très souvent liés à des désaccords sur ces théories et se manifestent donc sur le plan épistémologique. Par exemple, les discours de droite tendent à se présenter comme « réalistes » ; la droite libérale comme « rationnelle » ; par opposition à une gauche qui serait « utopiste ». En utilisant ces mots, on se place non sur le plan de la finalité politique mais sur celui de la connaissance : on admet que la finalité des systèmes politiques critiqués est louable, mais on prétend qu’ils reposent sur une vision fausse de la façon dont le monde fonctionne. C’est donc réellement sur la connaissance que porte le jugement, sur la validité empirique des théories sous-jacentes.</p>
<p>Le système politique néolibéral, par exemple (habituellement classé au centre droit), refuse généralement l’appellation « néolibéral », pourquoi ? Parce que ses partisans ne pensent pas suivre une doctrine particulière, mais simplement exprimer ce qui est rationnel, « logique ». D’un point de vue épistémologique, cette posture est critiquable, puisque la logique s’exprime dans un cadre formel, et donc dans un modèle particulier. Autrement dit, la rationalité s’exerce au sein d’une théorie particulière du monde, ce qui fait que deux discours contradictoires peuvent être rationnels, mais relatifs à des théories différentes. Par exemple, les discours Keynésiens et néoclassiques sont deux discours rationnels contradictoires, parce qu’ils reposent sur des modèles différents. Conformément à cette posture rationaliste, la pensée néolibérale ou néoclassique repose largement sur une connaissance mathématisée, c’est-à-dire dont les questions portent sur des aspects formels plutôt que sur la validité empirique du modèle sous-jacent (comme le concept de l’agent rationnel). La théorie tend par conséquent à ignorer les champs du savoir permettant de questionner empiriquement les modèles socio-économiques, tels que l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie. On peut donc formuler une critique épistémologique de cette pensée politique.</p>
<p>De manière symétrique, le discours de gauche tend à dépeindre la pensée politique de droite comme la manifestation sournoise de mauvaises intentions. Par exemple, le discours économique de droite tend à promouvoir la réduction de l’impôt, en particulier sur les plus riches. Ceci est vu par la critique de gauche comme la défense des intérêts d’une classe dominante. Pourquoi ? Encore une fois, on peut analyser la question sous l’angle épistémologique. Selon les théories de gauche, l’impôt est ce qui permet de répartir équitablement les richesses. Par conséquent, une mesure tendant à réduire l’impôt favorise les classes riches de la population. Il s’ensuit qu’un système politique qui promeut cette mesure doit avoir pour but de favoriser ces classes. Il s’agit encore une fois de la simple expression de la rationalité au sein d’un cadre théorique. On a donc dans le discours néolibéral et dans sa critique deux discours rationnels au sein de cadres théoriques différents.</p>
<p>Ce dernier exemple soulève un autre point épistémologique intéressant, qui est la façon dont les partisans d’une théorie jugent ceux d’une autre théorie. On voit dans cet exemple l’opposition de deux mépris : le néolibéral considère son critique comme idiot (irrationnel) ; le critique considère le néolibéral comme égoïste et de mauvaise foi. Dans les deux cas, le partisan juge son adversaire en utilisant son propre cadre théorique, c’est-à-dire comme si l’adversaire utilisait le même cadre théorique. En effet, le néolibéral juge son critique idiot, parce que ce critique serait effectivement idiot s’il adoptait le cadre théorique néolibéral mais n’en tirait pas les conclusions logiques (d’où le discours récurrent des gouvernants face à leur opposition qu’il faut « faire de la pédagogie », ce qui est perçu à juste titre comme du mépris). De même, l’opposant juge le néolibéral de mauvaise foi, c’est-à-dire qu’il considère que celui-ci est tout à fait conscient que ses propositions politiques favorisent la classe dominante. Or ceci suppose qu’il a adopté le cadre théorique alternatif de l’opposant. Dans les deux cas donc, chacun semble négliger la possibilité que son propre cadre de pensée est une théorie dont il est convaincu, et non une vérité évidente et universelle. Il en résulte une critique relativement stérile, en cela qu’elle ne porte pas sur les fondements (notamment empiriques) des théories en compétition mais sur les supposées compétences des interlocuteurs d’un côté (arguments d’autorité) et sur les intérêts personnels ou de classe de l’autre (invectives).</p>
<p>On touche ici à deux points distincts. D’une part, au statut épistémologique des théories (est-ce qu’elles se valent toutes et ne sont que des points de vue ? ou peut-on les juger empiriquement ou théoriquement ?). Sur ce point, on peut s’appuyer sur une riche littérature en philosophie des sciences. D’autre part, à la psychologie des croyances : qu’est-ce qui fait que l’on croit à certaines théories plutôt qu’à d’autres, et qu’éventuellement on change d’avis ? Sur ce deuxième point, on peut s’appuyer également sur une riche littérature en psychologie sociale, comme la <a href="https://www.psychologie-sociale.com/index.php/fr/theories/influence/6-la-theorie-de-la-dissonance-cognitive">théorie de la dissonance cognitive</a> dont je parlerai dans un prochain texte. Celle-ci propose que l’on cherche à rendre nos actes et nos croyances cohérents non seulement en agissant conformément à nos croyances, mais également dans de nombreux cas en adaptant nos croyances à nos actes (entre autres). Par exemple, une personne qui gagne beaucoup d’argent peut se convaincre qu’un système politique qui favorise l’inégalité est plus efficace. Ceci explique l’alignement entre catégories sociologiques et croyances politiques, qui est plus satisfaisante que la théorie de la mauvaise foi. Ce n’est effectivement pas un hasard si les classes supérieures tendent à adopter une théorie qui justifie leur position sociale (e.g. la théorie néolibérale), mais cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que cette adoption est cynique. Au contraire, ces croyances sont sincères. Simplement, différentes catégories sociologiques et culturelles sont plus ou moins susceptibles d’adopter différentes croyances.</p>
<p>Dans cette série, je compte donc développer une critique épistémologique du discours politique.</p>
