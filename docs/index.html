<p>Many healthcare services do not have the resources or capacity to subculture positive blood samples to diagnose bloodstream infections. As a result, centralisation of diagnostic laboratory services is becoming popular. &#8216;Centralisation&#8217; describes building up one &#8216;central&#8217; laboratory while closing or downgrading peripheral or smaller laboratories. In order to better utilise healthcare resources and save money, blood samples are increasingly being shipped to a central location for processing. In some low- and middle-income countries, a lack of necessary infrastructure and resources may mean that centralisation is the only viable option.</p>
<p>However, the impact of delaying the subculture of positive blood samples on the diagnostic yield of pathogens while they are shipped to central locations remains relatively unknown. In <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em>, researchers find that delaying subculture for up to a week didn&#8217;t impact the diagnostic yield for almost all of the pathogens investigated, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. However, the researchers demonstrate that storage temperature may affect viability, especially in tropical settings. The study provides useful data to consider when setting up new diagnostic microbiology services.</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm every year before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. These premature babies have a much higher risk of osteopenia. This condition leads to reduced bone mineral density and subsequent disease due to multiple prenatal and postnatal factors that impair bone remodelling.</p>
<p>Bone remodelling is essential for normal growth and development. Osteoclasts remove old bone while osteoblasts lay new. Normally, these two cell types work in balance, but if the rate of bone resorption outpaces new bone formation, the skeleton can become weak.</p>
<p>Physical activities that exert mechanical stress on the bones stimulate bone growth. In <em>BMC Pediatrics</em>, researchers performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the effect of three different physiotherapeutic methods on bone remodelling in preterm infants. The study found that reflex locomotion therapy (RLT) increased levels of bone formation biomarkers and the height of preterm infants. These results suggest that RLT positively affects bone formation and growth, which may help prevent and treat osteopenia in this population.</p>

<p>How did COVID-19 pandemic restrictions affect the lifestyle and health of our dogs? To help answer this question, researchers from the University of Edinburgh analysed data from over 4000 Labrador owners in England between March and July 2020.</p>
<p>The study found that Labradors visited the vets less often during this time and were less likely to be insured. This finding suggests that dogs might not have received their usual level of veterinary care. In addition, the number of vaccinations in Labradors also decreased during lockdown &#8211; this finding is valuable to prompt owners to check their dog&#8217;s vaccination history is up to date.</p>
<p>However, positives also accompanied pandemic restrictions. For example, Labradors enjoyed increased exercise, were more likely to be wormed and were less likely to be given treats by their owners. Labrador owners also reported less coughing by their dogs. This observation led to the researchers speculating that lockdown decreased the spread of infectious diseases like kennel cough due to a reduction in dogs&#8217; social interactions.</p>

<p>How did COVID-19 pandemic restrictions impact the mental health of pregnant women, postpartum women, and their partners? In <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>, researchers used data from an ongoing life-course pregnancy study known as the Queensland Family Cohort at the Mater Mother’s Hospital in Australia to help answer this question.</p>
<p>Pregnant women and their partners were prospectively recruited to the study before 24 weeks gestation. The 454 families participating in the study then completed questionnaires relating to mental health and general wellbeing at 24 weeks gestation and as well as 6 weeks postpartum. Families were recruited before (Aug 2018-Feb 2020), during (Mar-Aug 2020) and after the first lockdown was over (Sept-Dec 2020).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the lockdown did not negatively affect the mental health of the assessed population in Brisbane, Australia. On the contrary, the odds of pregnant women or postpartum women experiencing severe anxiety was more than halved in women during lockdown relative to women in the pre-COVID-19 period. In addition, the odds of pregnant and postpartum women experiencing severe stress decreased by over 70% post-lockdown relative to pre-COVID-19 levels.</p>

<p>High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) provides respiratory support for patients with acute hypoxemia respiratory failure (AHRF) &#8211; one of the most common causes of critical illness. However, in cases of HFNC failure, progressing treatment to mechanical ventilation is required. Mechanical ventilation delay is associated with increased mortality risk. In <em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</em>, researchers reviewed the records of 75 patients with AHRF treated with HFNC to identify early predictors of HFNC success to avoid mechanical ventilation delay and reduce mortality risk. The study finds that two hours after HFNC initiation, a modified respiratory rate oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2/RR) of less than 7.1 predicts success with HFNC therapy with 100% specificity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/herminia-pasantes-taurine-brain-cell-neuroscience">Herminia Pasantes discovered how taurine helps brain cells regulate their size</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Herminia Pasantes Ordóñez was about 14 years old, in 1950, she heard her mother tell her father that she would never find a husband. Pasantes had to wear thick glasses for her poor eyesight. In her mother’s eyes, those glasses meant her future as a “good woman” was doomed. “This made my life easier,” says Pasantes, “because it was already said that I was going to study.”</p>



<p>At a time when it was uncommon for women to become scientists, Pasantes studied biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, or UNAM. She was the first member of her family to go to college.</p>





<p>She became a neurobiologist and one of the most important Mexican scientists of her time. Her studies on the role of the chemical taurine in the brain offer deep insights into how cells maintain their size — essential to proper functioning. In 2001, she became the first woman to earn Mexico’s <a href="https://www.uv.mx/investigacion/convocatorias/premio-nacional-de-ciencias-y-artes-70-anos/">National Prize for Sciences and Arts</a> in the area of physical, mathematical and natural sciences.</p>



<p>“We basically learned about cell volume regulation through the eyes and work of Herminia,” says Alexander Mongin, a Belarusian neuroscientist at Albany Medical College in New York.</p>



<p>Pasantes did get married, in 1965 while doing her master’s in biochemistry at UNAM. She had a daughter in 1966 and a son in 1967 before starting a Ph.D. in natural sciences in 1970 at the <a href="https://en.unistra.fr/research/life-sciences-and-health/centre-for-neurochemistry-ups-3156">Center for Neurochemistry</a> at the University of Strasbourg in France. There, she worked in the laboratory of <a href="https://fondation.unistra.fr/impact/paul-mandel-un-precurseur-strasbourgeois-en-neurochimie/">Paul Mandel</a>, a Polish pioneer in neurochemistry.</p>



<p>The lab was trying to find out everything there was to know about the retina, the layer of tissue at the back of the eye that is sensitive to light. Pasantes decided to test whether free amino acids, a group that aren’t incorporated into proteins, were present in the retinas and brain of mice. Her first chromatography — a lab technique that lets scientists separate and identify the components of a sample — showed an immense amount of taurine in both tissues. Taurine would drive the rest of her scientific career, including work in her own lab, which she started around 1975 at the Institute of Cellular Physiology at UNAM.</p>



<p>Taurine turns out to be widely distributed in animal tissues and has diverse biological functions, some of which were discovered by Pasantes. Her research found that taurine helps maintain cell volume in nerve cells, and that it protects brain, muscle, heart and retinal cells by preventing the death of stem cells, which give rise to all specialized cells in the body.</p>

<p>Contrary to what most scientists had believed at the time, taurine didn’t work as a neurotransmitter sending messages between nerve cells. Pasantes demonstrated for the first time that it worked as an osmolyte in the brain. Osmolytes help maintain the size and integrity of cells by opening up channels in their membranes to get water in or out.</p>



<p>Pasantes says she spent many years looking for an answer for why there is so much taurine in the brain. “When you ask nature a question, 80 to 90 percent of the time, it responds no,” she says. “But when it answers yes, it’s wonderful.”</p>



<p>Pasantes’ lab was one of the big four labs that did groundbreaking work on cell volume regulation in the brain, says Mongin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her work and that of others proved taurine has a protective effect; it’s the reason the chemical is today sprinkled in the containers that carry organs for transplants. Pasantes’ work was the foundation for our understanding of how to prevent and treat brain edema, a condition where the brain swells due to excessive accumulation of fluid, from head trauma or reduced blood supply, for example. She and other experts also reviewed the role of taurine for Red Bull, which added the chemical to its formula because of potentially protective effects in the heart.</p>



<p>Pasantes stopped doing research in 2019 and spends her time talking and writing about science. She hopes her story speaks to women around the world who wish to be scientists: “It is important to send the message that it is possible,” she says.</p>



<p>Years before she was accepted into Mandel’s lab, her application to a Ph.D. in biochemistry at the UNAM was rejected. Pasantes says the reason was that she had just had her daughter. Looking back, this moment was “one of the most wonderful things that could’ve happened to me,” Pasantes says, because she ended up in Strasbourg, where her potential as a researcher bloomed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-galaxy-stars-data">How James Webb Space Telescope data have already revealed surprises</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massimo Pascale wasn’t planning to study the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. But as soon as he saw the cluster glittering in the first image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, he and his colleagues couldn’t help themselves.</p>



<p>“We were like, we have to do something,” says Pascale, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. “We can’t stop ourselves from analyzing this data. It was so exciting.”</p>



<p>Pascale’s team is one of several groups of scientists who saw the first JWST images and immediately rolled up their sleeves. In the first few days after images and the data used to create them were made public, scientists have estimated the amount of mass the cluster contains, uncovered a violent incident in the cluster’s recent past and estimated the ages of the stars in galaxies far beyond the cluster itself.</p>





<p>“We’ve been preparing for this for a long time. Myself, I’ve been preparing for years, and I’m not very old,” says Pascale, who is in his fourth year of graduate school. &nbsp;JWST “is really going to define a new generation of astronomers and a new generation of science as a whole.”</p>





<h4>Cluster collision</h4>



<p>When the image of SMACS 0723 was released in a White House briefing on July 11, most of the focus went to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">extremely distant galaxies in the background</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). But smack in the middle of the image is SMACS 0723 itself, a much closer cluster of galaxies about 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. Its mass bends light from even farther away, making more distant objects appear magnified, as if their light had traveled through the lens of another cosmic-sized telescope.</p>



<p>The light from the most distant galaxy in this image started its journey to JWST about 13.3 billion years ago — “almost at the dawn of the universe,” says astrophysicist Guillaume Mahler of Durham University in England, who is already using the picture as his Zoom background.</p>



<p>But the image can also fill in the history of the intervening galaxy cluster itself. “People sometimes forget about that — the galaxy cluster is also very important,” Pascale says.</p>



<p>Pascale’s and Mahler’s teams each started by taking inventory of the distant galaxies that appear stretched and distorted in the image. The light from some of those galaxies is warped such that multiple images of the same galaxy appear in different places. Mapping those multiply imaged galaxies is a sensitive probe of the way mass is spread around the cluster. That, in turn, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-clumps-galaxy-clusters-bend-light-surprisingly-well">reveal where the cluster contains dark matter</a>, the invisible, mysterious substance that makes up the majority of the mass in the universe (<em>SN: 9/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>Both teams found that SMACS 0723 is more elongated than it appeared in previous observations. They also found a faint glow, called intracluster light, inside the cluster from stars that don’t belong to any particular galaxy. Together, those features suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07101">SMACS 0723 is still recovering</a> from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07102">relatively recent smash-up</a> with another galaxy cluster, the teams report separately in a pair of papers submitted to arXiv.org on July 14.</p>



<p>A galaxy cluster that has been sitting on its own for eons should have a rounder distribution of matter and intracluster light, rather than SMACS 0723’s oblong shape. The stars that emit the intracluster light were probably ripped from their home galaxies by gravitational forces during the collision.</p>



<p>“Two separate clusters have merged together, and it looks to us as if it’s not totally settled yet,” Pascale says. “What we might be looking at is an ongoing merger.”</p>

<h4>Far-flung galaxies</h4>



<p>Mapping out mass in the cluster is also essential to decoding the properties of the more distant galaxies in the background of the image, Mahler says. “You need to understand the cluster and its magnification power to understand what’s behind.”</p>



<p>Some scientists are already investigating those distant galaxies in detail. The first JWST data include not just pretty pictures but also spectra, measurements of how much light an object emits at various wavelengths. Spectra allow scientists to determine how much a distant object’s light has been stretched — or redshifted — by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime#cosmic-expansion">expansion of the universe</a>, which is a proxy for its distance. Such data can also help reveal a galaxy’s composition and the ages of its stars.</p>



<p>“The main thing that limits the study of star formation in galaxies is the quality of the data,” says astrophysicist Adam Carnall of the University of Edinburgh. But with the vastly improved data from JWST, he says, he and his team were able to measure the ages of stars in those remote galaxies.</p>



<p>Carnall and colleagues turned their attention to the spectra of the distant galaxies just a few days after the SMACS image was released. They measured the redshifts of 10 galaxies, five of which <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08778">were particularly distant</a>, the team reports in a paper submitted to arXiv.org on July 18. One had already been highlighted as the most distant galaxy ever seen, with light that was emitted just 500 million years after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The other four shone as late as 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>All 10 galaxies were relatively young when they emitted the light captured by JWST, Carnall says. They had all switched on their star formation just a few million years earlier. That’s not especially surprising, but it is interesting.</p>



<p>“The ability to look at these small, faint galaxies … gives you a sense of how all galaxies must look when they start forming stars,” Carnall says.</p>



<p>Scientists hope to use JWST to find the first instances of star formation ever. Other early results suggest they’re already getting close.</p>



<p>Some galaxies in a JWST image <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09436">of another cluster</a> may hearken <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09434">from an even earlier time</a>, as early as 300 million years after the Big Bang, two research teams report in a pair of papers submitted to arXiv.org on July 19. One of those galaxies seems to have already built up a spiral disk about a billion times the mass of the sun, which is surprisingly mature for such an early galaxy.</p>



<p>And a tally of galaxies seen in the SMACS 0723 image suggests that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09428">galaxies with mature disks</a>, rather than disorganized blobs or ones made up mostly of dark matter, may have been more common in the very early universe than previously thought, another team reports in an arXiv.org paper submitted July 19. That means those early disks might not be outliers.</p>



<p>“Definitely these galaxies are a big deal, but it remains to be seen how exciting they will look in the context of a few months’ progress with JWST,” Carnall says. The best is yet to come.</p>

<p><strong>What did in the dinosaurs: Warm blood or soft eggs?</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/what-did-dinosaurs-warm-blood-or-soft-eggs"><em>Science News</em></a>, July 22, 1972</p>



<p>Dinosaurs might have been endothermic, or warm-blooded…. The combination of large size, endothermy and naked skin may explain the extinction of dinosaurs. About 65 million years ago there was a sharp drop in temperature…. Dinosaurs, lacking skin insulation and too large to burrow underground … could not survive. Meanwhile, evidence has come that … the shells [of their eggs] became progressively thinner … too fragile to support the growing embryo.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinos-straddled-line-between-cold-and-warm-blooded">dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded</a> and some could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-discoveries-suggest-earliest-dinosaurs-laid-soft-shelled-eggs">laid soft-shelled eggs</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/14, p. 6</em>). But neither trait led to the reptiles’ demise. In the late 1970s, geologists proposed that an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/closing-killer">asteroid strike triggered a mass extinction</a> (<em>1/25/92, p. 56</em>), killing more than 75 percent of life on Earth. That theory is now widely accepted. Scientists have even found the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">killer’s calling card: a crater about 180 kilometers wide</a> on the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-ancestors-inner-ears-warm-blooded-fossil">Mammal ancestors’ shrinking inner ears may reveal when warm-bloodedness arose</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hot or not? Peeking inside an animal’s ear — even a fossilized one — may tell you whether it was warm- or cold-blooded. Using a novel method that analyzes the size and shape of the inner ear canals, researchers suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04963-z">mammal ancestors abruptly became warm-blooded</a> about 233 million years ago, the team reports in <em>Nature</em> July 20.</p>



<p>Warm-bloodedness, or endothermy, isn’t unique to mammals — birds, the only living dinosaurs, are warm-blooded, too. But endothermy is one of mammals’ key features, allowing the animals to regulate their internal body temperatures by controlling their metabolic rates. This feature allowed mammals to occupy environmental niches from pole to equator, and to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-world-evolution-innovation-dinosaurs-paleontology">weather the instability of ancient climates</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/22</em>).</p>





<p>When endothermy evolved, however, has been a mystery. Based on fossil analyses of growth rates and oxygen isotopes in bones, researchers have proposed dates for its emergence as far back as 300 million years ago.</p>



<p>The inner ear structures of mammals and their ancestors hold the key to solving that mystery, says Ricardo Araújo, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Lisbon. In all vertebrates, the labyrinth of semicircular canals in the inner ear contains a fluid that responds to head movements, brushing against tiny hair cells in the ear and helping to maintain a sense of balance. That fluid can become thicker or thinner depending on body temperature.</p>



<p>“Mammals have very unique inner ears,” Araújo says. Compared with cold-blooded vertebrates of similar size, the dimensions of mammals’ semicircular canals — such as thickness, length and radius of curvature — is particularly small, he says. “The ducts are very thin and tend to be very circular compared with other animals.” By contrast, fish have the largest for their body size.</p>



<p>What if, Araújo and his colleagues hypothesized, the size and shape of the ear canals are related to the animal’s body temperature? In warm-blooded animals, the fluid becomes less viscous, and the canals may have shrunk to compensate. If so, it might be possible to trace how the shape of fossilized inner ear canals changed over time to discover when warm-bloodedness emerged in the mammal lineage.</p>



<p>To test that hypothesis, the researchers created a tool they call the “thermo-motility index” to link warm-bloodedness to those inner ear dimensions in 341 different vertebrates. Accounting for size differences, the value of this index turned out to closely track an animal’s body temperature, from fish to reptiles to mammals. Reptiles had low index values; mammals were high.</p>



<p>The team then applied this index to the fossilized ear canals of 56 extinct mammal ancestor species. To their surprise, the data showed a sharp change in inner ear morphology around 233 million years ago. That would correspond to an increase in body temperature of between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius — suggesting that endothermy evolved abruptly around that time, the team concludes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Heating up</h3>



<p>The inner ears of warm-blooded mammal ancestors called mammaliamorphs (illustrated, left) that lived in the Late Triassic Period had smaller, more tightly curved inner ear canals compared with earlier cold-blooded synapsids (right), which lived during the Permian Period. Analyses of the ear canal dimensions of mammal ancestors suggests warm-bloodedness emerged abruptly in the mammal lineage around 233 million years ago.</p>

<p>“The fact that it is a sharp break in the data [suggests] the transition happened rapidly, within about a million years,” says coauthor Kenneth Angielczyk, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clever study, says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work. “I’ve been using [computed tomography] data to study the shapes of inner ears for years, to try to infer how extinct species moved and how they could hear, and it never occurred to me that inner ear shape is related to metabolism and could be used to predict body temperatures of fossil species.”</p>



<p>However, Brusatte notes that there is a limit to what scientists can glean from fossilized ear canals alone, as they don’t reveal what soft tissues may have been present, such as the hair cells, or the actual viscosity of the ear fluid. “Shape alone may not always be sufficient to predict something as complex as body temperature or metabolic style.”</p>



<p>The timing of the purported shift, about 233 million years ago, corresponds to a geologically brief interlude of highly unstable climate known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">Carnian Pluvial Episode</a> (<em>SN: 9/30/21</em>). “It was a time when global temperatures were changing a lot, and it was also a very wet, humid time,” Angielczyk says. “One of the benefits of endothermy is that it stabilizes the internal body environment, lets you operate independent of environmental conditions.”</p>



<p>The finding highlights how “the whole Triassic was a bit insane,” Araújo says. The start of the Triassic was epically hot, coming on the heels of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">“Great Dying” mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian Period (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>). Vertebrate species had just begun to recover from that event when they were hit with the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Yet the Triassic also saw the dawn of both mammals and dinosaurs — both of which managed to survive.</p>



<p>It was “a crucial time period in the history of life,” Araújo says. All of that instability may have armed both groups with the evolutionary tools they needed to weather <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-triassic-mass-extinction-volcano-survival">yet another mass extinction at the end of the Triassic</a> 201 million years ago (<em>SN: 7/1/22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-tears-disease-particles-technology">A new technology uses human teardrops to spot disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human tears could carry a flood of useful information.</p>



<p>With just a few drops, a new technique <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c02531">can spot eye disease and even glimpse signs of diabetes</a>, scientists report July 20 in <em>ACS Nano</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We wanted to demonstrate the potential of using tears to detect disease,” says Fei Liu, a biomedical engineer at Wenzhou Medical University in China. It’s possible the droplets could open a window for scientists to peer into the entire body, he says, and one day even let people quickly test their tears at home.</p>





<p>Like saliva and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/test-could-warn-problems-kidney-transplant-recipients">urine</a>, tears contain tiny sacs stuffed with cellular messages (<em>SN: 9/3/13</em>). If scientists could intercept these microscopic mailbags, they could offer new intel on what’s happening inside the body. But collecting enough of these sacs, called exosomes, is tricky. Unlike fluid from other body parts, just a trickle of liquid leaks from the eyes.</p>



<p>So Liu’s team devised a new way to capture the sacs from tiny volumes of tears. First, the researchers collected tears from study participants. Then, the team added a solution containing the tears to a device with two nanoporous membranes, vibrated the membranes and sucked the solution through. Within minutes, the technique lets small molecules escape, leaving the sacs behind for analysis.</p>



<p>The results gave scientists an eyeful. Different types of dry-eye disease shed their own molecular fingerprints in people’s tears, the team found. What’s more, tears could potentially help doctors monitor how a patient’s diabetes is progressing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the scientists want to tap tears for evidence of other diseases as well as depression or emotional stress, says study coauthor Luke Lee, a bioengineer at Harvard Medical School. “This is just the beginning,” he says. “Tears express something that we haven’t really&nbsp;explored.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-smell-new-nose-brain-connection">Dogs are great sniffers. A newfound nose-to-brain connection helps explain why</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dog’s brain is wired for smell. Now, a new map shows just how extensive that wiring is.</p>



<p>Powerful nerve connections <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2022/07/06/JNEUROSCI.2355-21.2022">link the dog nose to wide swaths of the brain</a>, researchers report July 11 in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>. One of these canine connections, a hefty link between areas that handle smell and vision, hasn’t been seen before in any species, including humans.<br><br>The results offer a first-of-its-kind anatomical description of how dogs “see” the world with their noses. The new brain map is “awesome, foundational work,” says Eileen Jenkins, a retired army veterinarian and expert on working dogs. “To say that they have all these same connections that we have in humans, and then some more, it’s going to revolutionize how we understand cognition in dogs.”</p>





<p>In some ways, the results aren’t surprising, says Pip Johnson, a veterinary radiologist and neuroimaging expert at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Dogs are superb sniffers. Their noses hold between 200 million and 1 billion odor molecule sensors, compared with the 5 million receptors estimated to dwell in a human nose. And dogs’ olfactory bulbs can be up to 30 times larger than people’s. But Johnson wanted to know how smell information wafts to brain regions beyond the obvious sniffing equipment.</p>



<p>To build the map, Johnson and colleagues performed MRI scans on 20 mixed-breed dogs and three beagles. The subjects all had long noses and medium heads, and were all probably decent sniffers. Researchers then identified tracts of white matter fibers that carry signals between brain regions. A method called diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the movement of water molecules along tissue, revealed the underlying tracts, which Johnson likens to the brain’s “road network.”</p>



<p>After odor information enters the nose, it whizzes to the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that sits behind the dogs’ eyes. But from there, it wasn’t clear where the signals went next. &nbsp;When Johnson looked for the tracts in the dog MRI data, she was blown away. “I just kept finding these huge pathways,” she says. “They seem like information freeways running from the nose back into the brain.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Sniff system</h3>



<p>In the dog brain, sturdy neural tracts run from the olfactory bulb (bottom left) to five distinct spots. A newfound connection (orange) links the olfactory system to vision, something that has so far been found only in dogs. The others lead to the cortical spinal tract (turquoise path), which helps trigger instinctual behaviors; the piriform lobe (green path), which may play a role in odor perception; the limbic system (blue path), which is involved with behavior and emotion; and the entorhinal cortex (pink path), which helps handle memory.</p>

<p>This new dog brain map contains some familiar roads, including those that connect the olfactory bulb to brain areas associated with memories and emotions. In people, those roads explain why a whiff of perfume can transport a person back in time.</p>



<p>But one tract was totally new. This road, thick and obvious, connected the olfactory bulb to the occipital lobe, the part of the dog brain that handles vision. “There have been lots of people who theorized that this connection existed, based on the behavior of trained dogs and detection dogs,” says Jenkins, who currently practices at Huntsville Veterinary Specialists &amp; Emergency in Alabama and who was not involved in this study. “But nobody has been able to prove it. This is fabulous.”</p>



<p>Dogs use all their senses to evaluate their environment. But this newfound connection between smell and sight suggests that the two are intricately linked. Perhaps this anatomical link could be why smell can often compensate when a dog’s sight goes, Johnson says. “Blind dogs can still play fetch.”</p>



<p>Breeding can affect the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dogs-breed-brain-shape-humans">shapes of dog brains</a>, neuroscientist Erin Hecht of Harvard University and colleagues have found (<em>SN: 9/2/19</em>). It would be interesting to see how these olfactory tracts look in different dog breeds, including scent hounds bred and trained for jobs such as hunting, finding disaster survivors or identifying diseases like cancer or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-dog-detection-pcr-test-screening-coronavirus">COVID-19</a>, Hecht says (<em>SN: 6/1/22</em>). “This study lays a foundation for future work,” she says.</p>



<p>Johnson and her colleagues aim to explore olfactory tracts of other animals. “I have actually had a play with some cat data,” she says. “Cats have the most amazing olfactory system too, and probably more connections than the dog that I can see.” But dog people, settle down. “That’s only preliminary data,” she quickly adds.</p>

<p>Among the many kinds of velvety <em>Delena </em>huntsman spiders, four species from Australia show what for their kind is a downright freaky tolerance between a mom and her live-in offspring. “Cannibalism might happen occasionally, but with <em>Delena cancerides</em>, it&#8217;s almost never,” says behavioral ecologist Linda Rayor of Cornell University, who has studied them in the wild and in her lab for 20 years.</p>





<p>Not eating their own kind isn’t really the oddity here: Cannibalism varies a lot among spider species, Rayor says, but overall, it’s mostly a move of solitary kinds of spiders if they meet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">outside of flirting</a> or baby-guarding demands (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>A small number of <em>Delena</em> species, however, generally tolerate their own kind. The only exception Rayor sees in <em>D. cancerides</em> are a wild-caught female’s takedown of a full-grown male still in her cage after she lays eggs. “Wild-caught females are very intolerant of males who stick around too long,” she says.</p>



<p>What’s really strange, at least in the arachnid world, is these spiders’ shared family life. Out of the more than 50,000-plus known spider species, biologists classify fewer than 80 as truly social. In the most complex, hundreds or even thousands of females spin a great airy silken city, where some stay their entire lives. However, Rayor says, “my huntsman don’t do that.”</p>



<p>Some other biologists wouldn’t consider the <em>Delena</em> spiders Rayor studies as fully social — no spun-silk Sydney. Yet these spiders are not truly solitary either. A female doesn’t spin a web but shelters in a crevice, perhaps behind peeling bark on an acacia tree or under a slab of rock. These crevice-dwellers’ bodies look unusually flattened in profile: “a credit-card spider,” one scientist called the species, with some poetic license.</p>



<p>When a female triumphs in finding real estate, the kids can linger for months in her splendid mom cave — the kids with no sex life yet, that is. Never mind that older offspring already go out hunting on their own at night, or that often one or two later clutches of little ones hatch before the older ones leave. Spider moms guarding poppyseed-tiny hatchlings are common. Living with capable, nearly grown offspring, is strange in the arachnid world.</p>

<p>The most sociable of these sort-of tolerant moms, <em>D. cancerides</em>, lets a cohort of youngsters hang around the home for about a year after hatching. That’s a good portion of life for spiders that live only two and a half years. One of the reasons for doing so may sound familiar: Suitable housing can be hard to find.</p>



<p>Rayor once thought hanging with mom was an Australian thing, but she has now learned about tolerant moms from Madagascar in a <em>Damastes</em> species. To study the evolution of traits that add up to family life in the five species, Jacob Gorneau, now at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, and his Cornell colleagues used four genes from spiders in 37 huntsman genera to create the most ambitious genealogical tree yet of the family. Then Rayor turned to her decades of data to see what behaviors appeared on branches leading to lingering kids.</p>



<p>For instance, a form of egg sac called “plastered” — not drunk but spun like a firmly anchored splat on a surface of spider retreats — shows up in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790322001439">branches with the family-tolerant behavior</a>, the researchers report in the September issue of <em>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Spiders spin various shapes of outer sacs that discourage egg raiders. Spiders in a fixed retreat can conveniently anchor a sac, unlike some other moms that carry eggs with them. Also the more spread-out, plastered form might — Rayor emphasizes this is speculation — fit better in tight crevices than the puffier throw-pillow styles of egg sacs would.</p>



<p><em>Delena</em> spiderlings still carry abundant egg yolk with them when they clamber out of the egg sac. They don’t eat until after their first molt. “They’ve got these big, fat, green abdomens,” Rayor says. “They don’t have long legs, so they waddle.”</p>



<p>Once they molt, one benefit of this family lifestyle could be table scraps for the littles. Very young spiderlings are “ridiculously small,” Rayor says, and can handle food only about the size of a fruit fly. The chance to sneak extra shreds of meat from an older sib could greatly boost nutrition. Older sibs probably would rather not share, but Rayor sees “tolerated theft.”</p>



<p>Cute babies may not matter to a spider mom, but maybe they should to humans. Gorneau, once “very afraid of spiders,” wants to fight the stereotype of spiders as aggressive dangers. Rayor’s spiders strike him as “stoic,” mostly sitting quietly. Rayor’s lab full of spiders in their homes, he now finds, is a “calming environment.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-trunk-skin-stretch-top-bottom">The top side of an elephant’s trunk stretches more than the bottom</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a sunny day at Zoo Atlanta in 2020, Kelly the African bush elephant reached for a snack and revealed something strange.</p>



<p>High-speed cameras tracking her movements suggested that the skin on top of Kelly’s trunk stretched more than the skin underneath. “But that didn’t make any sense,” says Andrew Schulz, a mechanical engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>Scientists had assumed that elephant trunk skin largely stretches the same way all over. When Schulz sent data from Kelly and a male elephant, Msholo, to colleagues, they said, “Oh yeah, your data is wrong,” he remembers.</p>





<p>Follow-up experiments stretching pieces of elephant skin in the lab showed the same peculiar phenomenon: The skin on the top and bottom of the trunk are two entirely different beasts. “Talk about a great day as a scientist!” Schulz says. “That’s when we really started to believe that what we were saying was true.”</p>



<p>The tough upper skin of an elephant’s trunk, which crumples into creases and crags like the folded furrows of a shar-pei puppy, is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122563119">about 15 percent stretchier</a> than the gently wrinkled skin on the underside, Schulz and his colleagues report July 18 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>When an elephant elongates its trunk, the upper skin stretches more than the skin on the underside. Green crosses represent initial positions on the skin. As the trunk extends, the crosses turn red and move to the right, indicating how much the skin stretched.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That extra stretch probably helps elephants reach down and wrap their trunks around a log or a tree branch, while the wrinkled skin underneath gives the animals a good grip, Schulz says.</p>



<p>The team also observed that the trunk extends like a telescope, the tip reaching out first, followed by sections farther up. And at the trunk tip, it’s the skin that does most of the straining, not the muscle, mathematical modeling experiments suggest.</p>



<p>Scientists have long studied the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/muscular-machinery-tentacles-trunks-and-tongues">muscles in elephant trunks</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/88</em>). But skin has largely been overlooked, says Lucia Beccai, a soft roboticist at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa who wasn’t involved in the research. The new study “tells us that the structure of elephant skin is not all the same.”</p>



<p>Artificial skin is often modeled after human skin, but researchers could learn a lot from other animals, Beccai says. Understanding how Kelly’s and Msholo’s folds and wrinkles stretch is “surely information that will improve the design of soft robots,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-fermi-plasma-bubbles-clouds-disk-star-formation">Clouds in the Milky Way’s plasma bubbles came from the starry disk — and far beyond</a></h4>

              
                <p>Huge bubbles of plasma billowing out from the Milky Way’s center might contain scraps from all over the galaxy — and beyond.</p>



<p>A new look at gas clouds in the galaxy’s Fermi bubbles shows that the clouds contain <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01720-0">stuff from the galaxy’s starry disk</a> and from some mysterious other source. The finding could shed light on how galaxies in general live and die, astronomers report July 18 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The Fermi bubbles are giant blobs of plasma, tens of thousands of light-years tall, that extend on either side of the Milky Way’s galactic disk. When the bubbles were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-ways-black-hole-may-blow-bubbles">discovered in 2010</a>, astronomers thought they could have been formed by newborn stars (<em>SN: 11/9/10</em>). These days, many astronomers are instead convinced the bubbles could have been blown by a massive, long-ago burp emitted from the galaxy’s supermassive black hole.</p>





<p>In the years that followed the discovery, astronomers also spotted clouds of relatively cool gas that seem to flit around within the bubbles, high above the starry disk. “We call them high velocity clouds, because we’re not very good at naming things,” says astrophysicist Trisha Ashley of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</p>



<p>Scientists thought the clouds had been ripped from the Milky Way’s bright starry disk and sent flying when the Fermi bubbles formed. That assumption has been used to calculate things like the age of the bubbles, which could offer a clue to their origins.</p>



<p>“It made sense, it was a logical assumption,” Ashley says. “But no one had ever tested the origin of these clouds.”</p>



<p>Now Ashley and colleagues have made a first effort to figure out where the clouds come from — and found a surprising answer.</p>



<p>Using new and archived data from several telescopes, she and her team measured the metal content — the abundances of all the elements heavier than helium — in 12 high velocity clouds entrenched in the Fermi bubbles. Then the researchers compared the clouds’ chemistries to those of stars in the Milky Way’s disk. If the clouds really did come from the disk, they should have metal contents like the sun and other disk stars, Ashley says. If not, their metal contents should be lower.</p>



<p>The team found a wide range of metals in the clouds, from less than a fifth of the sun’s to more than the sun’s. That means “these clouds have to originate in both the disk of the Milky Way and the halo of the Milky Way,” she says, referring to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">chaotic cloud of gas and dust</a> that surrounds the galaxy and provides it with fuel for new stars (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>). “We haven’t figured out any other explanation.”</p>



<p>How those clouds got into the halo in the first place is still an open question, says Jessica Werk, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“There’s a number of ways these clouds can be produced, a number of origins and a number of fates,” she says. The clouds could have condensed within the halo on their own, or they could have been ripped from smaller galaxies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moveable-feast-milky-way-dines-its-neighbors">cannibalized by the Milky Way</a>, or a number of other origin stories (<em>SN: 7/24/02</em>). “This cycle in general is a very messy process.”</p>



<p>That messiness could help predict how the Milky Way’s star formation could change in the future. Cold gas clouds like these are the fuel for future star formation. If these clouds were born in the Milky Way’s gaseous halo but are being buoyed up by the Fermi bubbles instead of falling into the disk to form stars, that could eventually slow down the Milky Way’s star forming factories.</p>



<p>But if the gas clouds do end up forming new stars, that could mean the Milky Way is building new stars from a variety of cosmic sources.</p>



<p>“Ultimately what people are interested in is, how does the Milky Way sustain its star formation for a long time?” Werk says. “This tells you it’s not just one thing.”</p>



<p>Studying these bubbles and clouds can help astronomers understand other galaxies, too.</p>



<p>“We can see these things going on in other galaxies,” Ashley says. “But we have a front row seat to this one.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/underground-heat-pollution-buildings-climate-change">Underground heat pollution could be tapped to mitigate climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret to efficiently heating some buildings might lurk beneath our feet, in the heat that humans have inadvertently stored underground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as cities warm the surrounding air, giving rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-heat">urban heat islands</a>, so too does human infrastructure warm the underlying earth (<em>SN: 3/27/09</em>). Now, an analysis of groundwater well sites across Europe and parts of North America and Australia reveals that roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31624-6">a couple thousand of those locations</a> possess excess underground heat that could be recycled to warm buildings for a year, researchers report July 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>What’s more, even if humans managed to remove all this accumulated thermal pollution, existing infrastructure at about a quarter of the locations would continue to warm the ground enough that heat could be harvested for many years to come. That could reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and help mitigate climate change.</p>



<p>This work showcases the impact that underground heat recycling could have if harnessed on a large scale, says hydrogeologist Grant Ferguson of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, who was not involved in the study. “There’s a lot of untapped potential out there.”</p>



<p>Heat leaks into the subsurface from the warm roots of structures such as buildings, parking garages and tunnels, and from artificial surfaces such as asphalt, which absorb solar radiation. In Lyon, France, for example, researchers in 2016 found that human infrastructure warmed groundwater by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27531465/">more than 4 degrees Celsius</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists don’t fully understand how heat pollution alters underground environments. But warming of the subsurface can cause contaminants, such as arsenic, to move through groundwater more readily.</p>



<p>Extracting the thermal pollution could be accomplished by piping groundwater to heat pumps at the surface. The water, warmed underground by all that trapped heat, could then warm buildings as it releases heat into their cooler interiors, says Susanne Benz, an environmental scientist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.</p>



<p>Harnessing underground heat in this way could provide some communities with a reliable and low-energy means to warm their homes, Benz says. “And if we don’t use it, it will just continue to accumulate,” she says.</p>



<p>Benz and her colleagues analyzed the population size, heating demand and groundwater temperature at more than 6,000 locations, most of which were in Europe. The researchers found that at about 43 percent of the locations — mostly those near highly populated areas — enough heat had accumulated in the top 20 meters of earth to satisfy a year’s worth of the local heating demand.</p>



<p>Curious about sustainability, the researchers also identified places where the continuous flow of heat into the underground — and not just the stockpiled thermal pollution — was high. Their calculations show that if all of the accumulated heat was first extracted, the heat that continued leaking from existing infrastructure could be harvested at about 25 percent of the 6,000 locations. At 18 percent of locations, this recycled heat could satisfy at least a quarter of the heating demand of the local population.</p>



<p>Constructing systems to take advantage of human heat pollution today could one day help residents harvest heat from climate change, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Using climate projections for the end of the century, the team probed the feasibility of extracting underground heat in a warmer world. In the most optimistic warming scenario considered, which assumes greenhouse gas emissions peak about the year 2040, the researchers found that climate change would warm the ground enough by the end of the century that underground heat recycling at 81 percent of the studied locations could meet more than a quarter of locals’ heating demands. If there are no efforts to curb emissions, that number rises to 99 percent of locations.</p>



<p>Though the researchers focused mostly on Europe, Benz says that other continents probably also possess abundant underground heat that could be harnessed. In Europe and elsewhere, heat recycling might be most feasible in suburban areas, she says, where there is sufficient accumulated underground heat to help meet local heating demands, and space to install heat recycling systems.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Benz plans to investigate whether cooling the subsurface can help reduce aboveground temperatures in urban environments. “This might actually be a little additional tool to control [aboveground] urban heat.”</p>

                <p>When trying to avoid an unwanted thought, people often reactively reject and replace the thought after it occurs. But proactively avoiding an association in the first place can be much more efficient, and help prevent the repetitive looping of unwelcome thought patterns according to a new study in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>. Read our Research Highlight summary below to learn more about these findings, or jump to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Trying to stop thinking unwanted repetitive thoughts is a familiar experience for most. Often, a cue can repeatedly evoke unwelcome thought patterns or memories and we often struggle to make sure unwanted thoughts do not keep coming again and again in an endless loop. To address this issue, researchers looked at how we might more efficiently control unwanted thought patterns in our day to day lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>In the new study, Isaac Fradkin and Eran Eldar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel looked at how 80 English-speaking adults came up with new associations to common words. All participants viewed words on a screen and had to type an associated word. People in one group were told ahead of time they would not receive monetary bonuses if they repeated associations, so they set out to suppress the thoughts of previous words they had input. </p>



<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>



<p>Based on reaction times and how effective participants were at generating new associations, the researchers used computational approaches to model how people were avoiding repeated associations. Most people, they found, use reactive control &ndash; rejecting unwanted associations after they have already come to mind. &ldquo;This type of reactive control can be particularly problematic,&rdquo; the authors say, &ldquo;because, as our findings suggest, thoughts are self-reinforcing: thinking a thought increases its memory strength and the probability that it will recur. In other words, every time we have to reactively reject an unwanted association, it has the potential to become even stronger. Critically, however, we also found that people can partially preempt this process if they want to ensure that this thought comes to mind as little as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although people could not avoid unwanted thoughts, they could ensure that thinking an unwanted thought does not increase the probability of it coming to mind again,&rdquo; Fradkin adds. &ldquo;Whereas the current study focused on neutral associations, future studies should determine whether our findings generalize to negative and personally relevant unwanted thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-little-kids-side-effects-parents-questions">Here are experts’ answers to questions about COVID-19 vaccines for little kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Four weeks ago, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0618-children-vaccine.html"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-kids-babies-under-5-fda-united-states">signed off on COVID-19 vaccines for young children</a>. Days later, doctors’ offices and clinics began rolling out shots for babies and toddlers.</p>



<p>In Portland, Ore., a clinic featuring bubbles, toys and a dance party delivered more than 1,100 shots in two days. In Arizona, more than 2,000 kids under 5 have received their first dose in about three weeks. Over the same time period in Fayetteville, Ga., one practice has given out roughly 100 doses to young kids.</p>





<p>As of July 14, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total">nearly 400,000 kids under 5 have received at least one dose</a>, the CDC reports. That’s about 2 percent of eligible children in this age group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pediatrician Eliza Hayes Bakken has seen an initial rush of parents who signed up for appointments as soon as the vaccines became available. “There’s a huge push of families that want to be in that first group that’s vaccinated,” says Bakken, who treats kids at Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland. She suspects demand will soon taper off, following a pattern pediatricians have seen with vaccinations in older age groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting young kids vaccinated may be a long, slow haul, says Adrianne Hammershaimb, a&nbsp;pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jpids/piac049/6617115?login=false">About half of U.S. parents with children under 4 said they were likely to get their kids the shot</a>, her team reported last month in the <em>Journal of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases Society</em>. That number is “lower than we’d like, but it’s not surprising,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only about 55 percent of U.S. adults surveyed say <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/07/americans-reflect-on-nations-covid-19-response/">COVID-19 vaccination has been extremely or very effective</a> at limiting the coronavirus’ spread, the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., reported on July 7. In Hammershaimb’s experience, the issue isn’t that most parents are anti-vaxxers or mistrust all vaccines. Rather, “parents are genuinely concerned about the unknown,” she says. There’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccine-hesitancy-history-damage-anti-vaccination">a lot of misinformation out there</a>, she notes, and people are trying to figure out what’s best for their kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As BA.5 continues to spark cases (now accounting for <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">some 65 percent of new infections</a> in the United States), parents are talking to doctors about COVID-19 risks, vaccine safety and vaccination timing. Here, Hammershaimb and three other pediatricians answer some common questions they’ve been getting.</p>



<h4>Is COVID-19 really a problem for kids?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>“This is one big question we get a lot,” Hammershaimb says. Kids are just as likely to catch COVID-19 as adults, though<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405#:~:text=Children%20represent%20about%2019%25%20of,COVID%2D19%20with%20no%20symptoms."> cases tend to be milder</a>. Half of kids infected may have no symptoms at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The disease also tends to be deadlier for adults than children.

But COVID-19 can hit kids hard, too.

<p>“You hear on TV that COVID is not a big deal for kids,” says Sara Goza, a pediatrician in Fayetteville, Ga., who served as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2020. “That’s a little bit shocking.” In her practice, she’s seen infected children develop long COVID and chronic fatigue. “This disease is not without its complications,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bakken’s 9-year-old son caught COVID-19 in 2020, before the vaccine came out. His case wasn’t particularly serious, but he did have long-term effects. He had to take more medication to control his asthma and be extra cautious playing sports. That may seem minor, Bakken says, but it didn&#8217;t feel that way for her son. “It affected his daily life.”</p>



<h4>What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Parents taking their young kids to get the shot can expect to see side effects similar to those common in other childhood vaccines. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">Fatigue, fussiness, redness at the injection site</a> ​​— those are signs the body is responding to the vaccine like it’s supposed to, Bakken says. Some kids may have no side effects, and that’s OK, too, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccine safety is another topic parents have questioned (something that also came up in a recent <em>Science News </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1542502092203606016?s=20&amp;t=64e1Lqh9suZYAtIJeslhHQ">Twitter poll</a>). Clinical trials and real-world data suggest the vaccines are safe for kids and adults, Bakken says. “Adverse events are exceedingly rare — much more rare than complications from COVID itself.”</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis">myocarditis, the rare heart inflammation condition</a> sometimes seen after getting Pfizer’s or Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In boys between the ages of 12 and 17, myocarditis crops up <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-069445">in roughly 1 out of 10,000 following vaccination</a>, scientists reported July 13 in the <em>BMJ</em>.</p>



<p>But teen boys are up to<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7114e1.htm"> six times more likely to experience heart complications after COVID-19 infection compared with after vaccination</a>, CDC scientists reported in April. In younger boys, ages 5 to 11, heart complications following vaccination are even more rare. And in most people with myocarditis following vaccination, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html#:~:text=The%20severity%20of%20cases%20of,had%20prompt%20improvement%20of%20symptoms.">symptoms improve quickly and the heart fully recovers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hammershaimb is keeping an eye on CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration monitoring systems that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events">track potential adverse events to the vaccine</a>. If anything concerning comes up, she says, ”we can intervene, halt the vaccination program, and take a close look at any cases that are reported.” Ultimately, she says, parents need to weigh the hypothetical risk of a rare adverse reaction against the known risks of COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Should parents wait until the fall to vaccinate their kids?</h4>



<p>No, Hammershaimb says. She encourages parents to sign their kids up for their shots this summer, so they’ll head into fall with some coronavirus protection already built up. It’s possible that<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-booster-omicron-variant-coronavirus"> COVID-19 boosters targeting the omicron variant</a> may be available as the school year kicks off, but that doesn’t mean parents should wait, she says. “We want kids to be as protected as they can be when they go back to the classroom.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sophie Katz, a pediatric infectious disease doctor in Nashville, agrees. Though the current vaccines’ ability to prevent omicron infection in kids seems to wane rapidly,<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2792526"> the shots continue to be effective against hospitalization</a>, she wrote in a <em>JAMA</em> editorial in May. And a study of kids in Israel who had received the Pfizer vaccine found that<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2205011?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"> two doses offered moderate protection against the original omicron variant</a>, scientists reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> on June 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katz’s 13-month-old baby has already had COVID-19, but she says, “I am 100 percent going to get her vaccinated.” For Katz, it’s a matter of protecting her child from severe disease. “I will do anything to keep my daughter out of the hospital.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-steady-beat-radio-wave-space">A fast radio burst’s rapid, steady beat offers a clue to its cosmic origin</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unusual blast of radio waves from deep space had a sense of rhythm. Over the few seconds in December 2019 when the burst was detected, it kept a steady beat. That tempo holds clues to the potential origin of the mysterious outburst, one of a class of flares called fast radio bursts.</p>



<p>Of the hundreds of previously detected fast radio bursts, most last for mere milliseconds. But this one <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04841-8">persisted for roughly three seconds</a>, Daniele Michilli and colleagues report in the July 14 <em>Nature</em>. The burst consisted of multiple brief pulses, repeating about every two-tenths of a second.</p>





<p>Scientists have previously observed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-recorded-first-time">fast radio bursts that repeat</a> with a delay of minutes or days (<em>SN: 3/2/16</em>). “With this one it was a train of [pulses] one after the other, a heartbeat, like, ‘boom boom boom boom,’” says Michilli, an astronomer at MIT.</p>



<p>That makes this fast radio burst very special, says astrophysicist Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved with the research. Compared with other fast radio bursts, “this is a different animal.”</p>



<p>Scientists still don’t know how fast radio bursts are generated, but evidence has been building that they are associated with ultradense, spinning dead stars called neutron stars and, in particular, highly magnetic neutron stars called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">magnetars</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The steady repetition rate hints at what may have caused this particular blast, discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, a radio telescope in British Columbia.</p>



<p>Only certain types of cosmic processes produce such metronome-like signals. Neutron stars, for example, can appear to pulse as they spin, because they emit beams of radio waves that can sweep past Earth at regular intervals. Neutron stars tend to have tempos similar to that of the pulsating fast radio burst. But that burst was much more luminous than normal neutron star pulses, suggesting some unknown process would need to have amped up the emission.</p>



<p>Another idea is that large outbursts on magnetars could cause starquakes that jostle those stars’ solid crusts, generating regular barrages of radio waves. The rhythmic burst’s pulsing “is sort of consistent with a frequency with which we expect that magnetars could be shaking,” says astrophysicist Cecilia Chirenti of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>Or the pulsing might result from two neutron stars that orbit one another. Outbursts could occur at regular points in that orbit, when the magnetic regions that surround each neutron star interact.</p>



<p>Scientists don’t know if all fast radio bursts are generated in the same way. An outlier like this one might have a different origin story than a more standard, one-off blast. That means it’s hard to make conclusions about other fast radio bursts, Zhang says. “Whatever we can derive from this one, I would not easily extrapolate to the other guys.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pocket-gophers-farm-soil-roots-fertilize">Do gophers farm roots? It’s not as clear as viral articles claim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pocket gophers certainly don’t qualify as card-carrying 4-H members, but the rodents might be farming roots in the open air of their moist, nutrient-rich tunnels.</p>



<p>The gophers subsist mostly on roots encountered in the tunnels that the rodents excavate. But the local terrain doesn’t always provide enough roots to sustain gophers, two researchers report in the July 11 <em>Current Biology</em>. To make up the deficit, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00915-0">the gophers practice a simple type of agriculture</a> by creating conditions that promote more root growth, suggest ecologist Jack Putz of the University of Florida in Gainesville and his former zoology undergraduate student Veronica Selden.</p>





<p>But some scientists think it’s a stretch to call the rodents’ activity farming. Gophers aren’t actively working the soil, these researchers say, but inadvertently altering the environment as the rodents eat and poop their way around — much like all animals do.</p>



<p>Tunnel digging takes a lot of energy — up to 3,400 times as much as walking along the surface for gophers. To see how the critters were getting all this energy, Selden and Putz in 2021 began investigating the tunnels of southeastern pocket gophers (<em>Geomys pinetis</em>) in an area being restored to longleaf pine savanna in Florida that Putz partially owns.</p>



<p>The pair took root samples from soil adjacent to 12 gopher tunnels and extrapolated how much root mass a gopher would encounter as it excavated a meter of tunnel. Then the researchers calculated the amount of energy that those roots would provide.</p>



<p>“We were able to compare energy cost versus gain, and found that on average there is a deficit, with about half the cost of digging being unaccounted for,” Selden says.</p>



<p>Upon examining some tunnels, Selden and Putz saw gopher feces spread through the interior along with signs of little bites taken out of roots and churning of the soil.</p>



<p>The gophers, the researchers conclude, provide conditions that favor root growth by spreading their own waste as fertilizer, aerating the soil and repeatedly nibbling on roots to encourage new sprouting.</p>

<p>“All of these activities encourage root growth, and once the roots grow into the tunnels, the gophers crop the roots,” Selden says. She and Putz say that this amounts to a rudimentary form of farming. If so, gophers&nbsp;would be the first nonhuman mammals to be recognized as farmers, Putz says. Other organisms, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insects-ants-extreme-farming-methods-offer-good-bad-lessons">such as some insects</a>, also farm food and started doing so much earlier than humans (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the study has its skeptics. “I don&#8217;t really think you can call it farming per the human definition. All herbivores eat plants, and everybody&nbsp;poops,” says J.T. Pynne, a wildlife biologist at the Georgia Wildlife Federation in Covington who studies southeastern pocket gophers. So the root nibbling and tunnel feces might not be signs of agriculture, just gophers doing what all animals do.</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Ulrich Mueller agrees. “If we accept the tenuous evidence presented in the Selden article as evidence for farming … then most mammals and most birds are farmers because each of them accidentally have also some beneficial effects on some plants that these mammals or birds also feed on,” he says.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the study is also dangerous, says Mueller, of the University of Texas at Austin. The public will see through “the shallowness of the data,” he says, and will conclude that science is “just a bunch of storytelling, eroding general trust in science.”</p>



<p>For her part, Selden says she understands that because gophers don’t plant their crops, not everyone is comfortable calling them farmers. Still, she argues that “what qualifies the gophers as farmers and sets them apart from, say, cattle, which incidentally fertilize the grass they eat with their wastes, is that gophers cultivate and maintain this ideal environment for roots to grow into.”</p>



<p>At the very least, Putz says, he hopes their research makes people kinder toward the rodents. “If you go to the web and put in ‘pocket gopher,’ you’ll see more ways to kill them than you can count.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780226719603">Water Always Wins</a><br><em>Erica Gies</em> <br><em>Univ. of Chicago, $26</em></p>



<p>Humans have long tried to wrangle water. We’ve straightened once-meandering rivers for shipping purposes. We’ve constructed levees along rivers and lakes to protect people from flooding. We’ve erected entire cities on drained and filled-in wetlands. We’ve built dams on rivers to hoard water for later use.</p>



<p>“Water seems malleable, cooperative, willing to flow where we direct it,” environmental journalist Erica Gies writes in <em>Water Always Wins</em>. But it’s not, she argues.</p>





<p>Levees, which narrow channels causing water to flow higher and faster, nearly always break. Cities on former wetlands flood regularly — often catastrophically. Dams starve downstream environs of sediment needed to protect coastal areas against rising seas. Straightened streams flow faster than meandering ones, scouring away riverbed ecosystems and giving water less time to seep downward and replenish groundwater supplies.</p>



<p>In addition to laying out this damage done by supposed water control, Gies takes readers on a hopeful global tour of solutions to these woes. Along the way, she introduces “water detectives”— scientists, engineers, urban planners and many others who, instead of trying to control water, ask: What does water want?</p>





<p>These water detectives have found ways to give the slippery substance the time and space it needs to trickle underground. Around Seattle’s Thornton Creek, for instance, reclaimed land now allows for regular flooding, which has rejuvenated depleted riverbed habitat and created an urban oasis. In California’s Central Valley, scientists want to find ways to shunt unpolluted stormwater into ancient, sediment-filled subsurface canyons that make ideal aquifers. Feeding groundwater supplies will in turn nourish rivers from below, helping to maintain water levels and ecosystems.</p>



<p>While some people are exploring new ways to manage water, others are leaning on ancestral knowledge. Without the use of hydrologic mapping tools, Indigenous peoples of the Andes have a detailed understanding of the plumbing that links surface waters with underground storage. Researchers in Peru are now studying Indigenous methods of water storage, which don’t require dams, in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of water to Lima — Peru’s populous capital that’s periodically afflicted by water scarcity. These studies may help convince those steeped in concrete-centric solutions to try something new. “Decision makers come from a culture of concrete,” Gies writes, in which dams, pipes and desalination plants are standard.<br><br>Understanding how to work with, not against, water will help humankind weather this age of drought and deluge that’s being exacerbated by climate change. Controlling water, Gies convincingly argues, is an illusion. Instead, we must learn to live within our water means because water will undoubtedly win.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-inspired-glove-suckers-humans-grip-slippery-objects">This octopus-inspired glove helps humans grip slippery objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new high-tech glove totally sucks — and that’s a good thing.</p>



<p>Each fingertip is outfitted with a sucker inspired by those on octopus arms. These suckers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq1905">allow people to grab slippery, underwater objects</a> without squeezing too tightly, researchers report July 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Being able to grasp things underwater could be good for search and rescue, it could be good for archaeology, [and] could be good for marine biology,” says mechanical engineer Michael Bartlett of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>





<p>Each sucker on the glove is a raspberry-sized rubber cone capped with a thin, stretchy rubber sheet. Vacuuming the air out of a sucker pulls its cap into a concave shape that sticks to surfaces like a suction cup. Pumping air back into the sucker inflates its cap, causing it to pop off surfaces. Each finger is also equipped with a Tic Tac–sized sensor that detects nearby surfaces. When the sensor comes within some preset distance of any object, it switches the sucker on that finger to sticky mode.</p>



<p>Bartlett and colleagues used the glove to pick up objects underwater, including a toy car, plastic spoon and metal bowl. Each sucker could lift about one kilogram in open air — and could lift more underwater, with the help of buoyancy, Bartlett says. Adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>The octopus-inspired suckers on a new wetsuit glove can pick up objects of various shapes and materials, from a metal toy car to a delicate, squishy hydrogel bead. Sensors on the glove activate suction at its fingertips whenever it approaches an object, allowing wearers to pick items up without even closing their hands.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The octopus-inspired glove barely brushes the surface of what octopuses and other cephalopods can do. Octopuses can individually control thousands of suckers across their eight arms to feel around the seafloor and snatch prey. The suckers do this using not only tactile sensors, but also chemical-detecting cells that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">“taste” their surroundings</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new glove is far from turning fingers into extra tongues. But Bartlett is intrigued by the possibility of adding chemical sensors so that the suckers stick to only certain materials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-most-distant-rotating-light-13-billion-years-ago-big-bang">The most distant rotating galaxy hails from 13.3 billion years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is a galaxy spinning like a record in the early universe — far earlier than any others have been seen twirling around. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Astronomers have spotted signs of rotation in the galaxy MACS1149-JD1, JD1 for short, which sits so far away that its light takes 13.3 billion years to reach Earth. “The galaxy we analyzed, JD1, is the most distant example of a rotational galaxy,” says astronomer Akio Inoue of Waseda University in Tokyo.</p>





<p>“The origin of the rotational motion in galaxies is closely related to a question: how galaxies like the Milky Way formed,” Inoue says. “So, it is interesting to find the onset of rotation in the early universe.”</p>



<p>JD1 was discovered in 2012. Due to its great distance from Earth, its light had been stretched, or redshifted, into longer wavelengths, thanks to the expansion of the universe. That redshifted light revealed that JD1 existed just 500 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>Astronomers used light from the entire galaxy to make that measurement. Now, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile for about two months in 2018, Inoue and colleagues have measured more subtle differences in how that light is shifted across the galaxy’s disk. The new data show that, while all of JD1 is moving away from Earth, its northern part is moving away slower than the southern part. That’s <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac7447">a sign of rotation</a>, the researchers report in the July 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>JD1 spins at about 180,000 kilometers per hour, roughly a quarter the spin speed of the Milky Way. The galaxy is also smaller than modern spiral galaxies. So JD1 may be just starting to spin, Inoue says.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will observe JD1 in the next year to reveal more clues to how that galaxy, and others like ours, formed (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-space-travel-survival-humans">Tardigrades could teach us how to handle the rigors of space travel</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">No beast on Earth is tougher than the tiny tardigrade. It can survive being frozen at -272° Celsius, being exposed to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208008051">vacuum of outer space</a> and even being blasted with <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09553000500368453?journalCode=irab20">500 times the dose of X-rays</a> that would kill a human.</p>



<p>In other words, the creature can endure conditions that don’t even exist on Earth. This otherworldly resilience, combined with their endearing looks, has made tardigrades a favorite of animal lovers. But beyond that, researchers are looking to the microscopic animals, about the size of a dust mite, to learn how to prepare humans and crops to handle the rigors of space travel.</p>





<p>The tardigrade’s indestructibility stems from its adaptations to its environment — which may seem surprising, since it lives in seemingly cushy places, like the cool, wet clumps of moss that dot a garden wall. In homage to such habitats, along with a pudgy appearance, some people call tardigrades water bears or, adorably, moss piglets.</p>



<p>But it turns out that a tardigrade’s damp, mossy home can dry out many times each year. Drying is pretty catastrophic for most living things. It damages cells in some of the same ways that freezing, vacuum and radiation do.</p>



<p>For one thing, drying leads to high levels of peroxides and other reactive oxygen species. These toxic molecules chisel a cell’s DNA into short fragments — just as radiation does. Drying also causes cell membranes to wrinkle and crack. And it can lead delicate proteins to unfold, rendering them as useless as crumpled paper airplanes. Tardigrades have evolved special strategies for dealing with these kinds of damage.</p>

Yagi-Utsumi <em>et al</em>/<em>Scientific Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As a tardigrade dries out, its cells <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044209">gush out several strange proteins</a> that are unlike anything found in other animals. In water, the proteins are floppy and shapeless. But as water disappears, the proteins <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00724-6">self-assemble into long, crisscrossing fibers</a> that fill the cell’s interior. Like Styrofoam packing peanuts, the fibers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.02.462891v1">support the cell’s membranes and proteins</a>, preventing them from breaking or unfolding.</p>



<p>At least two species of tardigrade also produce another protein found in no other animal on Earth. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12808">This protein, dubbed Dsup</a>, short for “damage suppressor,” binds to DNA and may physically shield it from reactive forms of oxygen.</p>



<p>Emulating tardigrades could one day help humans colonize outer space. Food crops, yeast and insects could be engineered to produce tardigrade proteins, allowing these organisms to grow more efficiently on spacecraft where levels of radiation are elevated compared with on Earth.</p>



<p>Scientists have already inserted the gene for the Dsup protein into human cells in the lab. Many of those modified cells <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-dna-damage-radiation-death">survived levels of X-rays or peroxide chemicals</a> that kill ordinary cells (<em>SN: 11/9/19, p. 13</em>). And when <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12033-020-00273-9">inserted into tobacco plants</a> — an experimental model for food crops — the gene for Dsup seemed to protect the plants from exposure to a DNA-damaging chemical called ethyl methanesulfonate. Plants with the extra gene grew more quickly than those without it. Plants with Dsup also incurred less DNA damage when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.</p>

<p>Tardigrades’ “packing peanut” proteins show early signs of being protective for humans. When <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.1c00572">modified to produce those proteins</a>, human cells became resistant to camptothecin, a cell-killing chemotherapy agent, researchers reported in the March 18 <em>ACS Synthetic Biology</em>. The tardigrade proteins did this by inhibiting apoptosis, a cellular self-destruct program that is often triggered by exposure to harmful chemicals or radiation. </p>



<p>So if humans ever succeed in reaching the stars, they may accomplish this feat, in part, by standing on the shoulders of the tiny eight-legged endurance specialists in your backyard.</p>
