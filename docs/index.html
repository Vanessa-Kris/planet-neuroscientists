              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">NASA’s DART mission successfully shoved an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>It worked! Humanity has, for the first time, purposely moved a celestial object.</p>



<p>As a test of a potential asteroid-deflection scheme, NASA’s DART spacecraft shortened the orbit of asteroid Dimorphos by 32 minutes — a far greater change than astronomers expected.</p>



<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">rammed into the tiny asteroid</a> at about 22,500 kilometers per hour on September 26 (<em>SN: 9/26/22</em>). The goal was to move Dimorphos slightly closer to the larger asteroid it orbits, Didymos.</p>





<p>Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose any threat to Earth. DART’s mission was to help scientists figure out if a similar impact could nudge a potentially hazardous asteroid out of harm’s way before it hits our planet.</p>



<p>The experiment was a smashing success. Before the impact, Dimorphos orbited Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroid-s-motion-in-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the orbit was 11 hours and 23 minutes</a>, NASA announced October 11 in a news briefing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="334" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101122_LG_DART_inline-1.gif" alt="A gif of two asteroids, one of which was hit by a spacecraft to change its orbit." class="wp-image-3118281" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118281">A small spacecraft called LICIACube, short for Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, detached from DART just before impact, then buzzed the two asteroids to get a closeup view of the cosmic smashup. Starting from about 700 kilometers away, this series of images captures a bright plume of debris erupting from Dimorphos (right in the first half of this gif), evidence of the impact that shortened its orbit around Didymos (left). At closest approach, LICIACube was about 59 kilometers from the asteroids.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118281">ASI, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For the first time ever, humanity has changed the orbit of a planetary body,” said NASA planetary science division director Lori Glaze.</p>



<p>Four telescopes in Chile and South Africa observed the asteroids every night after the impact. The telescopes can’t see the asteroids separately, but they can detect periodic changes in brightness as the asteroids eclipse each other. All four telescopes saw eclipses consistent with an 11-hour, 23-minute orbit. The result was confirmed by two planetary radar facilities, which bounced radio waves off the asteroids to measure their orbits directly, said Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>The minimum change for the DART team to declare success was 73 seconds — a hurdle the mission overshot by more than 30 minutes. The team thinks the spectacular plume of debris that the impactor kicked up gave the mission extra oomph. The impact itself gave some momentum to the asteroid, but the debris flying off in the other direction pushed it even more — like a temporary rocket engine.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting and promising result for planetary defense,” Chabot said. But the change in orbital period was just 4 percent. “It just gave it a small nudge,” she said. So knowing an asteroid is coming is crucial to future success. For something similar to work on an asteroid headed for Earth, “you’d want to do it years in advance,” Chabot said. An upcoming space telescope called <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/near-earth-object-surveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Near Earth Asteroid Surveyor</a> is one of many projects intended to give that early warning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy">The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac90ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, </a>&nbsp;astronomers report in the Oct. 1<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.</p>





<p>Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723</a>, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.</p>



<p>For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/globular-star-cluster-surprising-few-heavy-elements">wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters</a>, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (<em>SN: 10/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">cosmic dawn</a>,” when stars were first able to form at all (<em>SN: 3/4/22</em>)?</p>



<p>Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg" alt="galaxy cluster SMACS 0723" class="wp-image-3118215" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-585x383.jpg 585w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-284x186.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118215">Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler.

Mowla <em>et al</em>/<em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.</p>



<p>“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.</p>



<p>In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.</p>



<p>Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.</p>



<p>Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nikon-small-world-photography-2022">A glimpse inside a gecko’s hand won the 2022 Nikon Small World photo contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life is beautiful at all scales, from big to small. Sometimes that splendor is concealed beneath literal scales.</p>



<p>A mesmerizing peek below the developing scales on the hand of an embryonic Madagascar giant day gecko (<em>Phelsuma grandis</em>) won first place in <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2022 Nikon Small World photomicrography competition</a>. The winning image, stitched together from hundreds of images taken over two days with a confocal microscope, was crafted by University of Geneva researchers Grigorii Timin and Michel Milinkovitch. The pair study the genetics and physics of embryonic development.</p>



<p>The hand is artificially colored to show budding nerves in cyan and structures containing collagen in a range of oranges and yellows. Collagen is a building block of life, says Milinkovitch. Knowing where collagen is can help researchers better understand how bodies and tissues develop.</p>

<p>Parts of bones that have started to calcify shine brightest in the image, Timin says. Developing tendons and ligaments stretch as orange branches. Blood cells form clusters or line up inside new blood vessels at the tips of the gecko’s digits.</p>





<p>The image highlights beauty of all sizes, Milinkovitch says. The snapshot is “beautiful as a hand, you see this beautiful pattern of the fingers. Then you zoom, you see the spongy bones. And you zoom, you see the tendons. And you zoom, and you see the fibers that’s from the tendons. Then you zoom, and you see the blood cells.”</p>



<p>The gecko photo is one of 92 incredible images recognized in this year’s competition. The winners of the 48th annual contest <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were announced</a> October 12.

<p>From a distance this photograph may look like a cluster of grapes. But each orb is a sprawling clump of cells inside breast tissue. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer immunologist Caleb Dawson of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia, took thousands of images using a confocal microscope to view tiny, musclelike cells that wrap around milk-producing spheres. He used dyes and antibodies to mark the cells yellow and magenta in this second-place-winning image.</p>



<p>The cells respond to the hormone oxytocin, Dawson says. Oxytocin is released during breastfeeding and helps squeeze milk out of the spheres, called alveoli. Such images of lactating breast tissue can help researchers figure out how immune cells keep breast tissue and the babies it can feed healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Snuffed candle</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1875" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2.jpg" alt="a 2.5 times magnified photo of unburned pieces of carbon drifting away in wisps from an extinguished candle" class="wp-image-3118251" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-306x383.jpg 306w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-149x186.jpg 149w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-464x580.jpg 464w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-621x776.jpg 621w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118251">Unburned pieces of carbon drift away from an extinguished candle in this photograph, magnified 2.5 times normal size.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118251">Ole Bielfeldt, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ole Bielfeldt had to be quick to capture the last gasp of an extinguished candle.</p>



<p>Candle wax is made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, which turn mostly into carbon dioxide when lit on fire. But not all those hydrocarbons burn, instead accumulating as soot on surfaces close to the candle. “When the flame goes out, the glowing wick has enough heat left to break up the wax molecules for a while, but not enough to burn the carbon,” says Bielfeldt, a photographer in Cologne, Germany. “So you get a trail of smoke until it cools.”</p>



<p>Using a fast shutter speed and a bright LED light, Bielfeldt managed to capture those unburned particles of carbon drifting away, earning sixth place.</p>



<h3>Iridescent slime mold</h3>

Most slime molds have smooth heads but this pair features what look like wrinkled pompoms.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118252">Alison Pollack, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hidden on leaves and decaying logs in moist forests are minuscule works of art like these <em>Lamproderma </em>slime molds.</p>



<p>In the dappled sun of an October day, photographer Alison Pollack of San Anselmo, Calif., saw a sparkly leaf as she was digging through a leaf pile. After taking the leaf home and looking through a microscope, she was transfixed by the crinkly heads and iridescence of slime mold. Around 40 hours of work and 147 combined images later, Pollack had captured a striking snapshot that she likes to anthropomorphize as a nurturing relationship: parent and child, two lovers, or brother and sister. The photo earned fifth place in the contest.</p>



<p>Most slime molds have smooth heads, which release spores into the environment to reproduce. This pair may have dried too fast, stunting their development and leaving their heads wrinkly, Pollack says. But that’s OK, “because the texture to me is just gorgeous.”</p>



<h3>A deadly predator</h3>

<p>All fear the predacious tiger beetle, especially this poor fly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murat Öztürk of Ankara, Turkey, nabbed 10th place in this year’s competition with an astounding — and unnerving — snapshot of a tiger beetle using its mandibles to crush a fly by its eyes.</p>



<p>Tiger beetles (<em>Cicindelinae</em>) sprint after their prey so quickly that the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1998/01/tiger-beetles-go-blind-chasing-prey-high-speeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insects go temporarily blind</a>. The photographed beetle would have stopped multiple times to orient itself to figure out where the fly was, eventually snatching its meal. Thanks to the beetle’s strong and sharp jaws, “the chances of survival of the creatures caught by this insect are very low,” Öztürk says. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Coral close-up</h3>

Lewis/Queensland University of Technology, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Opal Reef off the coast of Australia, some cauliflower coral (<em>Pocillopora verrucosa</em>) polyps appear green. But the same organism is transformed when viewed under a microscope in the lab.</p>



<p>To reveal the polyp’s individual cells, marine scientist Brett Lewis of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, stitched together more than 60 images taken over 36 hours. The coral naturally fluoresces a medley of blues, purples and pinks when exposed to different wavelengths of light. Algae living inside the polyp appear orange or pink, while the coral’s tissues shine blue. The image won 12th place in the competition.</p>



<p>One amazing thing about the photo, Lewis says, is that in some areas, algal cells shine through a light blue haze. That’s because coral tissue is transparent; algae give coral its color.</p>



<p>Peeks of coral’s internal makings can help scientists understand its biology, Lewis says. His work, for instance, aims to figure out how young polyps build strong foundations when they attach to a surface — an important step in building or restoring coral reefs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-swimming-groups-effectiveness-fertility">Cooperative sperm outrun loners in the mating race</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even sperm gotta stick together.</p>



<p>Bull sperm swim more effectively when in clusters, a new study shows, potentially offering insight into fertility in humans. In simulated reproductive tracts of animals like cattle and humans, the behavior increases the chances that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.961623/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groups of cooperative bovine sperm will outpace meandering loners</a> as they race to fertilize a female egg cell, physicist Chih-kuan Tung and colleagues report September 22 in <em>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The benefits of clustering don’t come down to flat-out speed. “They are not faster,” says Tung, of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro. “In terms of speed, they are comparable or slower” than sperm traveling alone. Like the sperm equivalent of herds of tortoises racing individual hares, the winners are not necessarily the swiftest but rather the ones that can stay on target.</p>





<p>On their own, sperm tend to follow curved paths — which is a problem, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But when sperm gather in groups of two or more, they swim along straighter routes. It’s behavior that a couple of the same researchers noted in a previous study where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-feather-sperm-flock-together">they tracked sperm swimming in stationary fluids</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/16</em>). Although that might give sperm clusters an advantage, it would only help if they happen to be going the right direction. Other benefits of sperm clustering weren’t clear until the researchers developed an experimental setup that introduced flowing fluid into their experiments.</p>



<p>In creatures like humans and cattle, sperm make their way to the ovum by swimming against a current of mucus that streams through the cervix and away from the uterus. It’s difficult to study what benefits clustering might confer while swimming upstream inside living beings. So Tung and colleagues created an analog in their lab: a shallow, narrow, 4-centimeter-long channel filled with a thick fluid that mimics natural mucus and flows at rates the researchers could control.</p>



<p>Whether alone or in groups, sperm naturally tend to swim upstream. However, clusters of sperm in the experiment did a better job heading upstream into the mucus flow, while individual sperm were more likely to head off in other directions. Despite the speedier travels of some individual sperm, a poorer ability to point upstream hampered the progress of sperm loners compared with slower moving clusters.</p>

</div><figcaption>In a thick, mucuslike fluid flowing from left to right, clusters of sperm travel more consistently against the flow than individual sperm do on their own.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clusters also stayed the course in the face of rapidly flowing mucus. When the researchers turned up the flow in their apparatus, many individual sperm were washed away. Sperm clusters were much less likely to get swept downstream.</p>



<p>While sperm in the study were bovine, the advantages of clustering should also apply to human sperm, Tung says. Sperm of both species have similar dimensions. The swimmers typically compete to fertilize a single ovum. And unlike pigs or other animals where semen is deposited directly in the uterus, both human and bovine sperm start out in the vagina and travel through the cervix to get to the uterus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying sperm in fluids that closely resemble the flowing mucus in reproductive tracts could reveal problems that don’t turn up in conventional observations of sperm swimming in stationary fluids, Tung says. “One hope is that this sort of knowledge can help us do better diagnoses” to provide clues to understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-show-age">infertility in humans</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/03</em>).</p>



<p>Subjecting sperm to realistic settings in the lab may soon offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">practical help for people who have trouble conceiving</a>, says fertility researcher Christopher Barratt of the University of Dundee in Scotland, who was not affiliated with the study (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>“How a sperm cell responds to its surroundings and how that may change its behavior is a very important subject,” Barratt says. “This type of technology could be used, or adapted, to select better quality sperm,” for people in need of fertility assistance. “That would be a very big deal.”</p>

                <p><strong>Selected paper:</strong> <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276">Calaim, Dehmelt, Gonçalves and Machens, The geometry of robustness in spiking neural networks, eLife (2022)</a></p>



<p><strong>The main message:</strong> This theoretical neuroscience paper describes an intuitive way how to think about the effect of single spikes in a network where the output and its error is closely monitored and used as feedback. This intuition is best illustrated by the video below. The video shows how the activity of a network tries to trace a target (in this case a sinus wave). Each neuron defines a boundary (the differently colored lines in the video in the 2D case). If the output of the network exceeds one such boundary surface, a corrective spike of the respective neuron is emitted. The signal is therefore kept in the target zone by being bounced back once it becomes incorrect. This enables us for example to think about cases where single neurons are perturbed &#8211; when they are excited, inhibited or when they die &#8211; in an intuitive and geometric way in terms of single spikes.</p>

<p><strong>The strong points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This visualization of the spiking dynamics in a neuronal network makes several points intuitively clear. For example, why such networks are robust to deletion or inhibition but not excitation of a single neuron (this is illustrated by deformations of the bounding box).<br /></li>



<li>More generally, the visualization makes it intuitive how neurons might be able to cooperate when taking advantage of such specific and fast feedback loops.<br /></li>



<li>This sort of simulated network tends to produce unphysiological or at least undesired behavior (discussed as &#8220;ping-pong&#8221; effect in the paper). This behavior becomes quite apparent and understandable due to the intuitive visualization.<br /></li>



<li>Finally, it is simply really cool to use this visualization tool and to think about redundant neurons as those neurons where the boundary surfaces in this bounding box have similar locations/orientations.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The weak points:</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>The first weak point is that the presentation, despite the nice and intuitive video above, does not seem, from my perspective, accessible for everybody. Here, the task of the presented network is to approximate an externally supplied function (e.g., a sinus function). While many other neuroscientists, also many theoretical neuroscientists, think about neuronal networks as devices to represent information and to transform it, this paper therefore rather aims for a &#8220;control&#8221; approach. In my opinion, it is reasonable to think about the brain as a control device (to control the environment), but I feel that many readers might be already lost because they don&#8217;t understand why such an approach is taken. Only when reading the related work by the group (for an introduction, check out <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Boerlin et al.</a>, PLoS Comp Biol (2013) or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Denève and Machens</a>, Nat Neuro (2016)), one understands that this property of function approximation could also be a useful model of normal operation of the brain, where the task is to react towards the environment and not to approximate a god-given function. I feel that the authors introduce their idea not in an ideal way to reach a broader audience, especially since I the general idea could in principle be understood by a broader audience.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>It is not clear how the intuition about the effect of single spikes and the target zone in the bounding box would translate to other network architectures that do not follow the rather specific designs. These network designs were described in previous work by <a href="https://machenslab.org/">Christian Machens</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&amp;user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Sophie Denève</a> and feature a specific excitatory/inhibitory connectivity. A core feature of such networks is that the voltages of neurons are largely synchronized but their spiking is not, resulting in a seemingly asynchronous firing regime as found in the cortex, despite redundancy at the voltage behavior of single neurons.<br />This limitation also came up during the review process. The authors try to discuss these questions in detail and to address some of them, as much as possible, with additional analyses and models. Check out <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276#sa1">the open reviews</a> (which are always accessible for eLife papers)!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I like the paper because it comes up with a surprising, new and maybe even useful idea. It attempts to think about the consequences and circumstances of a single neuron&#8217;s spike, and how the effect of this single spike on other neurons can be understood. As a caveat, all these intuitions come with the assumption that there is a closely monitored error of the output signal, which in turn is fed back into the system in a very precise manner. This assumption might seem very strong in the beginning. However, in order to understand things, we have to make some assumptions, and even from wrong assumptions, we might be able to develop first intuitions about what is going on. I would be curious whether and how this bounding box picture could be applied to other network architectures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tua-tagovailoa-concussion-traumatic-brain-injury-head-hit-risk">Why traumatic brain injuries raise the risk of a second, worse hit</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a football game on September 25, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa got the pass off but he got knocked down. Fans watched him shake his head and stumble to the ground as he tried to jog it off. After a medical check, he went back into the game against the Buffalo Bills with what his coach later said was a back injury.</p>



<p>Four days later, in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Tagovailoa, 24, got hit again. This time, he left the field on a stretcher with what was later diagnosed as a concussion.</p>





<p>Many observers suspect that the first hit — given Tagovailoa’s subsequent headshaking and wobbliness — left the athlete with a concussion, also called a mild traumatic brain injury. If those were indeed signs of a head injury, that first hit may have lined him up for an even worse brain injury just days later.</p>



<p>“The science tells us that yes, a person who is still recovering from a concussion is at an elevated risk for sustaining another concussion,” says Kristen Dams-O’Connor, a neuropsychologist and director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. As one example, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a concussion roughly doubled the chance of a second one</a> among young Swedish men, researchers reported in 2013 in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“This, I think, was avoidable,” Dams-O’Connor says of Tagovailoa’s brain injury in the game against the Bengals.</p>



<p>After a hit to the head, when the soft brain hits the unyielding skull, the injury kicks off a cascade of changes. Some nerve cells become overactive, inflammation sets in, and blood flow is altered. These downstream events in the brain — and how they relate to concussion symptoms — can happen over hours and days, and are not easy to quickly measure, Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>That makes diagnosing a concussion tricky. Clinicians often have to rely on patients saying they feel off or fuzzy. Professional athletes might not be eager to share those symptoms if it means they’ll be sidelined. “These are elite athletes who are conditioned to suck it up,” Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>Other signs can indicate a concussion, such as a person’s gait or pupil dilation. “As clinicians, we are often triangulating multiple sources of information to make that call — was this or was this not a concussion?” Dams-O’Connor says. The scientific uncertainty in that call should lead clinicians to err on the side of caution, she says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;After a traumatic brain injury, recuperation is crucial. “It’s much worse when an individual isn’t given the proper time to rest and recover and gets a second impact in a close period of time,” says Daniel Daneshvar, a brain injury medicine doctor and neuroscientist at Mass General Brigham in Boston and Harvard Medical School. Looking at the brains of mice after two close-together hits, researchers have seen signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-study-offers-clues-brains-response-concussions">worse damage and a longer recovery</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/16</em>).</p>



<p>For athletes, that vulnerability comes in part from concussion symptoms themselves. Slowed reaction times, dizziness and double vision confound a quick-moving quarterback who needs to dodge tackles and see opponents coming from the side. Those symptoms can lead to further injury to the head — and to the rest of the body. A concussion <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9402462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases the risks</a> of lower extremity injuries, according to a recent analysis of National Football League players published in August in <em>Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, a healing brain is more susceptible to jarring. While the brain is still recovering in the weeks after an injury, “your threshold for getting a concussion is lower,” Daneshvar says. A lighter hit, researchers suspect, can do more damage. A rare condition called second impact syndrome illustrates an extreme outcome of successive brain injuries. This catastrophic, often fatal brain swelling happens when a still-healing brain is hit again.</p>



<p>That’s not what happened to Tagovailoa. But two concussions close together can delay recovery, Dams-O’Connor emphasizes. “I think people minimize how life-altering that can be.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced that they are jointly investigating whether their concussion protocols were followed in this case. Tagovailoa may have been allowed back into that first game because his stumbling was attributed — correctly or not — to a back injury, not a brain injury. The NFL and NFLPA are considering changing the protocol to keep a player out of a game for any obvious motor instability, regardless of cause.</p>



<p>For now, Tagovailoa is moving through the stages of recovery outlined in the concussion protocol. In a social media post on September 30, Tagovailoa <a href="https://twitter.com/Tua/status/1575961296423784449/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanked</a> his team, friends and family and everyone who has reached out in support. “I’m feeling much better and focused on recovering so I can get back out on the field with my teammates,” he wrote.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fishers-tree-climbing-carnivores-washington-forest">Tree-climbing carnivores called fishers are back in Washington’s forests</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Holding an antenna above his head, Jeff Lewis crept through an evergreen forest in the Cascade mountains, southeast of Seattle. As he navigated fallen fir logs and dripping ferns, he heard it: a faint “beep” from a radio transmitter implanted in an animal code-named F023.</p>



<p>F023 is a fisher (<em>Pekania pennanti</em>), an elusive member of the weasel family that Lewis fondly describes as a “tree wolverine.” Resembling a cross between a cat and an otter, these sleek carnivores hunt in forests in Canada and parts of the northern United States. But fur trapping and habitat loss had wiped out Washington’s population by the mid-1900s.</p>





<p>Back in 2017 when Lewis was keeping tabs on F023, he tracked her radio signal from a plane two or three times a month, along with dozens of other recently released fishers. Come spring, he noticed that F023’s behavior was different from the others.</p>



<p>Her locations had been clustered close together for a few weeks, a sign that she might be “busy with babies,” says Lewis, a conservation biologist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. He and colleagues trekked into the woods to see if she had indeed given birth. If so, it would be the first wild-born fisher documented in the Cascades in at least half a century.</p>



<p>As the faint beeps grew louder, the biologists found a clump of fur snagged on a branch, scratch marks in the bark and — the best clue of all — fisher scat. The team rigged motion-detecting cameras to surrounding trees. A few days later, after sifting through hundreds of images of squirrels and deer, the team hit the jackpot: a grainy photo of F023 ferrying a kit down from her den high in a hemlock tree. The scientists were ecstatic.</p>



<p>“We’re all a bunch of little kids when it comes to getting photos like that,” Lewis says.</p>





<h4>Chasing babies</h4>



<p>This notable birth came during the second phase of a 14-year fisher reintroduction effort. After 90 fishers were released in Olympic National Park from 2008 to 2010, the project turned its focus east of Seattle, relocating 81 fishers in the South Cascades (home to Mount Rainier National Park) from 2015 to 2020, and then 89 fishers in the North Cascades from 2018 to 2020. The animals were brought in from British Columbia and Alberta. The project concluded last year, when researchers let loose the final batch of fishers.</p>

<h3>Three forests</h3>



<p>Washington’s fisher recovery efforts relocated the animals to three regions of the state: the Olympic Peninsula west of Seattle and the North and South Cascades, a mountain range separated by Interstate 90.</p>

<p>Baby animals are the key measure of success for a wildlife reintroduction project. As part of Washington’s Fisher Recovery Plan, biologists set out to document newborn kits as an indicator of how fishers were faring in the three relocation regions.</p>



<p>Before F023’s kit was caught on camera in May 2017, biologists had already confirmed births by seven relocated females on the Olympic Peninsula, where the whole project began. Two of the seven females had four kits, “the largest litter size ever documented on the West Coast,” says Patti Happe, wildlife branch chief at Olympic National Park. Most females have one to three kits.</p>



<p>Lewis is often asked, why put all of this effort into restoring a critter many people have never heard of? His answer: A full array of carnivores makes the ecosystem more resilient.</p>



<p>Happe admits to another motive: “They’re freaking adorable — that’s partly why we’re saving them.”</p>

<h4>The missing piece</h4>



<p>Contrary to their name, fishers don’t hunt fish, though they’ll happily munch on a dead one if it’s handy. They mainly prey on small mammals, but they also eat reptiles, amphibians, insects, fruit and carrion. About a meter long, males weigh up to six kilograms, about twice as much as females. Fun facts: Females raise young high above the forest floor in hollowed-out spaces in tree trunks. Fishers can travel face-first down tree trunks by turning their hind feet 180 degrees. They have wickedly sharp teeth and partially retractable claws. And they’re incredibly agile, leaping up to two meters between branches and traveling as much as 30 kilometers in a day.</p>



<p>Fishers’ stubby legs and unique climbing skills make them a threat to tree-climbing porcupines. It isn’t pretty: A fisher will force the quill-covered animal down a tree and attack its face until it dies from blood loss or shock. Then the fisher neatly skins the prickly prey, eating most everything except the quills and bones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="539" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3.jpg" alt="two camera trap photos showing female fisher F105 carrying one of her four kits down from her tree den to the ground" class="wp-image-3118168" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-483x383.jpg 483w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-568x450.jpg 568w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline3-235x186.jpg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118168">These camera trap photos, taken in April 2021, show female fisher F105 carrying one of her four kits down from her tree den near Lake Wenatchee in the North Cascades.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118168">NPS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But these fearsome predators were no match for humans. In the 1800s, trappers began targeting fishers for their fur. Soft and luxuriant, the glossy brown-gold pelts were coveted fashion accessories, selling for as much as $345 each in the 1920s. This demand meant fishers disappeared not only from Washington, but from more than a dozen states across the northern United States. Once fisher populations plummeted, porcupines ran rampant across the Great Lakes region and New England. This wreaked havoc on forests because the porcupines gobbled up tree seedlings.</p>



<p>Hoping to keep porcupine populations in check, private timber companies partnered with state agencies to bring fishers back to several states in the 1950s and 1960s. Thanks to these efforts and stricter trapping regulations, fishers are once again abundant in Michigan, Wisconsin, New York and Massachusetts.</p>



<p>But in Washington, like most of the West, fisher numbers were still slim. By the turn of the 21st century, no fisher had been sighted in the state for over three decades.</p>



<p>As in the Midwest and New England, private timber companies in Washington supported bringing back fishers. Although porcupines are uncommon in Washington, mountain beavers — a large, primitive rodent endemic to the Pacific Northwest — fill a similar role in Washington’s evergreen forests: They eat tree seedlings. And fishers eat them.</p>



<p>By 2006, the state hatched a plan to bring the animals in from Canada. “It was a big opportunity to restore a species,” Lewis says. “We can fix this.”</p>

<h4>A new home</h4>



<p>Like the other Canadian fishers moved to Washington, F023’s relocation story began when she walked into a box trap in British Columbia, lured by a tasty morsel of meat. The bait had been set by local trappers hired by Conservation Northwest, a nonprofit that is one of the recovery project’s three main partners, along with Washington Fish and Wildlife and the National Park Service. After veterinarians checked her health and administered vaccines and antiparasitics to help her survive in her new home, F023 received a surgically implanted radio transmitter and was driven across the border.</p>



<p>She was met by members of the fisher recovery team, who released her just south of Mount Rainier National Park. The forest’s towering Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock trees were full of cubby holes and cavities to hide in, and the undergrowth held plenty of small mammals to eat. At the release, upward of 150 people gathered around F023’s box, part of the team’s effort to engage the public in championing fisher recovery. Everyone cheered as a child opened the door and the furry female bounded into the snowy woods, out of sight in a flash.</p>



<p>The team monitored each relocated fisher for up to two years to see if the project met key benchmarks of success in each of the three regions: more than 50 percent of the fishers surviving their first year, at least half establishing a home range near the release site, and a confirmed kit born to at least one female.</p>



<p>“We met those marks,” says Dave Werntz, science and conservation director at Conservation Northwest.</p>



<p>The effort may have been aided by a series of bypasses built over and under a roughly 25-kilometer stretch of Interstate 90 east of Seattle. One of these structures is the largest wildlife bridge in North America, an overpass “paved” with forest. In 2020, a remote camera caught an image of what looks like a fisher moving through one of the underpasses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="824" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4.jpg" alt="aerial photo of an highway overpass with trees and plants to help animals cross" class="wp-image-3118177" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-479x383.jpg 479w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-563x450.jpg 563w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-233x186.jpg 233w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-725x580.jpg 725w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_inline4-970x776.jpg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118177">Speeding vehicles on busy highways pose a threat to fishers and other migrating wildlife.

OF TRANSPORTATION</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Male fishers go on these huge walkabouts to find females,” Werntz says. While biologists assumed fishers would cross the freeway to search for mates, having photographic proof “is pretty wonderful,” he says.</p>



<p>Happe and others hope to also see wildlife crossings along Interstate 5 one day. The freeway, which runs north-south near the coast, is the main obstacle keeping the Olympic and Cascade populations apart, she says. “We’re all working on wildlife travel corridors and connectivity in hopes the two populations hook up.”</p>



<h4>Learning curve</h4>



<p>The majority of the initial 90 fishers relocated to the Olympic Peninsula settled nicely into their new homes, according to radio tracking. In the year following release in that location, <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.22192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fisher survival rate averaged 73 percent</a>, but varied based on the year and season they were released, as well as sex and age of the fishers.</p>



<p>Males fared better than females: Seventy-four percent of recorded deaths were of females, partly because they are smaller and more vulnerable to predators, such as bobcats and coyotes. Of 24 recovered carcasses where <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358083667_Post-release_survival_of_translocated_fishers_implications_for_translocation_success" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause of death could be determined</a>, 14 were killed by predators, seven were struck by vehicles, two drowned and one died in a leg-hold trap, Lewis, Happe and colleagues reported in the April 2022 <em>Journal of Wildlife Management</em>.</p>



<p>Because the first fishers relocated to the Olympic Peninsula were released in several locations, the animals had trouble finding mates. As a result, only a few parents sired the subsequent generations.</p>



<p>The researchers became concerned when they looked at the genetic diversity of fishers on the Olympic Peninsula six years post-relocation. Happe and colleagues set up 788 remote cameras and hair-snare stations: triangular cubbies open on either end with a chicken leg as bait in the middle and wire brushes protruding from either side to grab strands of fur. DNA analysis of the fur <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.21788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised red flags about inbreeding</a>, Happe and Lewis say.</p>



<p>“Models showed we were going to lose up to 50 percent of genetic diversity, and the population would wink out in something like 100 years,” Happe says. To expand the gene pool, the team brought 20 more fishers to the Olympic Peninsula in 2021. These animals came from Alberta whereas the founding population had hailed from British Columbia.</p>

</div><figcaption>Two fishers from Canada are released from wooden crates, quickly disappearing into Olympic National Park in November 2021. Both wear radio tracking devices so that researchers can monitor their well-being.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the reintroduction effort moved into the Cascades, the team adapted, based on lessons learned from the Olympic Peninsula. For instance, to increase the likelihood of fishers finding each other more quickly, the animals were released at fewer sites that were closer together. The team also released the animals before January, giving females ample time to settle into a home range before the spring mating and birthing season.</p>



<h4>Finding their food</h4>



<p>As the experiment went on, more unanticipated findings popped up. Fishers released in the southern part of the Cascades <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/673301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were more likely to survive the first year</a> (76 percent) than those relocated north of I-90 (40 percent), according to the final project report, released in June. Remote-camera data suggest that’s because there are less prey and slightly more predators in the North Cascades, says Tanner Humphries, community wildlife monitoring program lead for Conservation Northwest.</p>



<p>And in both the Cascades and the Olympic Peninsula, fishers are using different types of habitat than biologists had predicted, Happe says. The mammals — once assumed to be old-growth specialists — are using a mosaic of young and old forests. Fishers require large, old trees with cavities for denning and resting. But in younger managed forests where trees are thinned or cut, prey may be easier to come by.</p>



<p>Live traps in the South Cascades support that idea. Fishers’ preferred prey — snowshoe hares and mountain beavers — were most abundant in young regenerating forests. In older forests, traps <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037811271931833X?via%3Dihub" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037811271931833X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected mainly mice, voles and chipmunks</a>, which are not substantial meals for fishers, Mitchell Parsons, a wildlife ecologist at Utah State University in Logan, reported with Lewis, Werntz and others in 2020 in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-675x450.jpg" alt="photo of two fishers perched on a log" class="wp-image-3118173" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-574x383.jpg 574w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover-870x580.jpg 870w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100822_fishers_cover.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118173">North America&#8217;s fisher populations are blossoming, helping to rebalance forest ecosystems.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118173">Emily Brouwer/NPS (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 2.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>The future is re-wild</h4>



<p>After F023’s baby was caught on camera five years ago, the mother’s tracking chip degraded as designed — the hardware lasts less than two years. Since then, many more fisher kits have been born in Washington.</p>



<p>In fact, these furry carnivores are one of the most successfully translocated mammals in North America. According to Lewis, 41 different translocation efforts across the continent have helped fisher populations blossom. The animals now occupy 68 percent of their historical range, up from 43 percent in the mid-1900s.</p>



<p>With the last batch of fishers delivered to Washington in 2021, the relocation phase of the project has ended. Lewis, Happe and their partners plan to continue monitoring how these sleek tree-climbing carnivores are faring — and how the ecosystem is responding. For instance, fishers are indeed <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/534cb901e4b0bf0aaecab50f/t/62d05a194070f66efe548b22/1657821721947/Happe+et+al+2021+NWNat+OP+Fisher+diet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feasting on seedling-eating mountain beavers</a>, according to research reported by Happe, Lewis and others in 2021 in <em>Northwestern Naturalist</em>.</p>



<p>Given climate change, species loss and ecosystem degradation, animals worldwide face difficult challenges. The fact that fishers are thriving once again in Washington offers hope, Lewis says.</p>



<p>“It’s a hard time, it’s a hard world, and this feels like something we’re doing right,” he says. “Instead of losing something, we’re getting it back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-buried-lake-ice-rock-liquid-water-radar">Mars’ buried ‘lake’ might just be layers of ice and rock</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Follow the water” has long been the mantra of scientists searching for life beyond Earth. After all, the only known cradle of life in the cosmos is the watery planet we call home. But now there’s more evidence suggesting that a potential discovery of liquid water on Mars <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01775-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not be so watertight</a>, researchers report September 26 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>In 2018, scientists announced <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid-water-search-life">the discovery of a large subsurface lake near Mars’ south pole</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/18</em>). That claim — and follow-up observations suggesting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-south-pole-ice-surrounded-pools-water">additional buried pools of liquid water</a> on the Red Planet (<em>SN: 9/28/20</em>) — fueled excitement about finally finding an extraterrestrial world possibly conducive to life.</p>





<p>But researchers have since proposed that those discoveries might not hold up to scrutiny. In 2021, one group suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lakes-liquid-water-south-pole-ice-cap-mirages">clay minerals and frozen brines</a>, rather than liquid water, might be responsible for the strong radar signals that researchers observed (<em>SN: 7/16/21</em>). Spacecraft orbiting Mars beam radio waves toward the Red Planet and measure the timing and intensity of the reflected waves to infer what’s beneath the Martian surface. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now another team has shown that ordinary layers of rock and ice can produce many of the same radar signals previously attributed to water. Planetary scientist Dan Lalich of Cornell University and his colleagues calculated how flat layers of bedrock, water ice and carbon dioxide ice — all known to be plentiful on Mars — reflect radio waves. “It was a pretty simple analysis,” Lalich says.</p>



<p>The researchers found that they could reproduce some of the anomalously strong radar signals thought to be due to liquid water. Individual radar signals from different layers of rock and ice add together when the layers are a certain thickness, Lalich says. That produces a stronger signal, which is then picked up by a spacecraft’s instruments. But those instruments can’t always tell the difference between a radio wave coming from one layer and one that’s the result of multiple layers, he says. “They look like one reflection to the radar.”</p>



<p>These results don’t rule out liquid water on Mars, Lalich and his colleagues acknowledge. “This is just saying that there are other options,” he says.</p>



<p>The new finding is “a plausible scenario,” says Aditya Khuller, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved in the research. But until scientists get a lot more data from the Red Planet, it’ll be difficult to know whether liquid water truly exists on Mars, Khuller says. “It’s important to be open-minded at this point.”</p>

<p>In this blog Jennifer Harman, the Editor of <a href="https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em></a>, will be sharing her highlights, discussing future directions for the journal and introducing speakers who have joined the Editorial Board.</p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity, Ecosytem Services and Sustainable Development</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> is welcoming submissions to its ‘</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/about/bessd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Sustainable Development</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216; Collection, which aims to bring together research on the sustainable use of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, I was keen to learn about new areas related to this topic. </span></p>

<p><strong><em>The impact of hydropower on aquatic ecosystems</em></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I very much enjoyed a talk given by <a href="https://n.ethz.ch/~lumartins/">Dr Luiz Silva</a>, a senior scientist developing an Ecohyraulics research group within the Institute for Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich. Ecohydrology involves collaboration between ecologists, hydrologists and engineers to explore practical solutions to increase the capacity of the aquatic ecosystems to cope with human impacts. With the humans causing unprecedented change to the natural world, it is more important than ever to manage water resources sustainably to prevent further biodiversity loss.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr Silva introduced modelling techniques to research fish interaction with water infrastructure. He proposed a tool to quantify habitat shifts and pathways for fish to escape rapid flow changes such as those caused by hydropeaking. Hydropeaking describes the discontinuous release of water that introduce artificial flow fluctuations in rivers to increase hydroelectric power production at hydro dams to meet electricity demand. With hydropower becoming more widely used as we transition to renewable energy sources, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact of hydropower on aquatic ecosystems and to consider how to design hydropower technology with fish in mind. <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> encourages submissions on this topic and is delighted to welcome Dr Luiz Silva as an Editorial Board Member. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Upscaling agroecology practices</em></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A series of insightful talks on integrating ecological principles into the design and management of agricultural systems also piqued my interest. <a href="https://forschung.boku.ac.at/fis/suchen.person_uebersicht?sprache_in=en&amp;menue_id_in=101&amp;id_in=151817">Dr Andreas Mayer</a>, a new <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> Editorial Board Member from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, discussed the need for transformative changes to increase the sustainability of agri-food systems and achieve the European Green Deal’s goal to become climate neutral by 2050. To understand what changes are feasible, we require a deeper understanding of which practices and changes are sustainable if widely adopted without risking supply shortfalls or burden shifting. We also need greater knowledge of synergies and trade-offs in the agricultural system. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr Mayer introduced the diagnostic biophysical land-system and G</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reen House Gas (GHG) emission</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> model <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021002817?via%3Dihub">BioBaM-GHG 2.0</a>. The model aims to evaluate the feasibility and associated GHG emissions of large numbers of agro-food systems and land-use scenarios at various geographical scales. As an illustrative example, Dr Mayer described the use of the tool to analyse strategies for the expansion of agroecological measures in the European Union.</span></p>
<p><strong>Plants under pressure: The impact of environmental change on plant ecology </strong></p>
<p>The congress provided an invaluable opportunity to attend a number of talks on the impact of environmental change on plant ecology. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the human impact on the planet intensifies, plants are becoming increasingly under pressure. According to the IUCN redlist, one in five plant species are under threat of extinction. Life on earth depends on plants which provide food, fuel, shelter, medicine, clean air, absorb carbon dioxide, </span>filter water, and supply the oxygen we breathe. Losing a plant species affects every organism that directly or indirectly relies on it. Therefore, research on the impact of human activity and climate change on plants is needed to help develop strategies to safeguard ecosystem services and reverse biodiversity decline. <span data-preserver-spaces="true"><em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> encourages submissions on this topic and is looking to recruit Editorial Board Members with expertise researching the impact of environmental change on plant ecology. If you have expertise in this field and would like to join the Editorial Board, please reach out to Jennifer Harman &lt;<a href="mailto:jennifer.harman@springernature.com">jennifer.harman@springernature.com</a>&gt;.</span></p>
<p>Dr Isabel Barrio, an ecologist at <span data-preserver-spaces="true">the Agricultural University of Iceland, gave an eye opening talk on plant-herbivore interactions in the changing north. Plant-herbivore interactions play a vital role in the functioning of alpine and Arctic tundra ecosystems through their effects on biodiversity, energy flows and nutrient cycling. However, these ecosystems are rapidly changing due to global warming. As climate change threatens to destabilise these ecosystems, collaborative research on plant-herbivore interactions is needed to develop management strategies, set conservation priorities, preserve ecosystem services and protect biodiversity. Dr Barrio leads the <a href="https://old.uarctic.org/shared-voices/shared-voices-magazine-2021/eating-plants-to-mitigate-the-impacts-of-climate-change-on-tundra/">UArctic Thematic Network on Herbivory</a> &#8211; an international network consisting of over 200 members that brings together researchers investigating the role of herbivores in alpine and arctic ecosystems. The researchers suggest that plant damage by insects will likely increase in a warmer Arctic as you can find insects throughout the tundra, and insect herbivory rises with temperature. For a full list of Herbivory Network publications, <a href="https://herbivory.lbhi.is/hn-papers-and-conference-presentations/">click here</a>. In 2023, <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> looks forward to working with Dr Barrio to launch a call for papers relating to this research area. </span></p>

<p>A personal highlight was a talk given by <a href="http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/chinsamyturan">Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turnan</a> from The University of Cape Town. Anusuya elegantly introduced how information locked within the bones of extinct species can provide glimpses into long-lost worlds.</p>
<p>For example, the presence of medullary bone in fossil birds, a tissue unique to reproductively active female birds, can be used to identify female specimens. This knowledge was used to show that deposits of Dromornis stirtoni specimens ((a.k.a the Thunder Bird)<em> </em>containing two forms was due to sexual dimorphism. Bone histology has also revealed new information about the life history of the dodo, which shows that this iconic bird adapted its lifestyle to Mauritius’s cyclone season (from November and March). Dodo bones exhibit repeated lines of arrested growth, indicating periods of food shortage during stormy weather. Similar to modern birds living on the island, the breeding season of dodos was likely to have been in August. Once chicks hatched, they grew quickly to sexual maturity before the cyclone season began. Cavities indicative of bone resorption, which accompanies new feather growth, suggest that dodos molted between March and July.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silkworm-artificial-silk-strong-fiber-spider-metal-ion-bath">A metal ion bath may make fibers stronger than spider silk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Super strong artificial silk? That’s so metal.</p>



<p>Giving revamped silkworm silk a metallic bath <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00517-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may make the strands both strong and stiff</a>, scientists report October 6 in <em>Matter</em>. Some strands were up to 70 percent stronger than silk spun by spiders, the team found.</p>



<p>The work is the latest in a decades-long quest to create fibers as strong, lightweight and biodegradable as spider silk. If scientists could mass-produce such material, the potential uses range from the biomedical to the athletic. Sutures, artificial ligaments and tendons — even sporting equipment could get an arachnid enhancement.</p>







<p>“If you&#8217;ve got a climbing rope that weighs half of what it normally does and still has the same mechanical properties, then obviously you&#8217;re going to be a happy climber,” says Randy Lewis, a silk scientist at Utah State University in Logan who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Scrounging up enough silky material to make these super strong products has been a big hurdle. Silk from silkworms is simple to harvest, but not all that strong. And spider silk, the gold-standard for handspun strength and toughness, is not exactly easy to collect. “Unlike silkworms, spiders cannot be farmed due to their territorial and aggressive nature,” write study coauthor Zhi Lin, a structural biologist at Tianjin University in China, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Scientists around the world have tried to spin sturdy strands in the lab using silkworm cocoons as a starting point. The first step is to strip off the silk’s gummy outer coating. Scientists can do this by boiling the fibers in a chemical bath, but that can be like taking a hatchet to silk proteins. If the proteins get too damaged, it’s hard for scientists to respin them into high-quality strands, says Chris Holland, a materials scientist at the University of Sheffield in England who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Lin’s team tried gentler approaches, one of which used lower temperatures and a papaya enzyme, to help dissolve the silk’s coating. That mild-mannered method seemed to work. &nbsp;“They don’t have little itty-bitty pieces of silk protein,” Lewis says. “That’s huge because the bigger the proteins that remain, the stronger the fibers are going to be.”</p>

Wang <em>et al</em>/<em>Matter</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After some processing steps, the researchers forced the resulting silk sludge through a tiny tube, like squeezing out toothpaste. Then, they bathed the extruded silk in a solution containing zinc and iron ions, eventually stretching the strands like taffy to make long, skinny fibers. The metal dip could be why some of the strands were so strong — Lin’s team detected zinc ions in the finished fibers. But Holland and Lewis aren’t so sure.</p>



<p>The team’s real innovation may be that “they’ve managed to unspin silk in a less damaging way,” Holland says. Lewis agrees. “In my mind,” he says, “that&#8217;s a major step forward.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-spores-cells-life-signals-environment">How dormant bacteria spores sense when it’s time to come back to life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bacteria go to extremes to handle hard times: They hunker down, building a fortress-like shell around their DNA and turning off all signs of life. And yet, when times improve, these dormant spores can rise from the seeming dead.</p>



<p>But “you gotta be careful when you decide to come back to life,” says Peter Setlow, a biochemist at UConn Health in Farmington. “Because if you get it wrong, you die.” How is a spore to tell?</p>





<p>For spores of the bacterium <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, the solution is simple: It counts.</p>



<p>These “living rocks” sense it’s time to revive, or germinate, by essentially counting how often they encounter nutrients, researchers report in a new study in the Oct. 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“They appear to have literally no measurable biological activity,” says Gürol Süel, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego. But Süel and his colleagues knew that spores’ cores contain positively charged potassium atoms, and because these atoms can move around without the cell using energy, the team suspected that potassium could be involved in shocking the cells awake.</p>



<p>So the team exposed <em>B. subtilis</em> spores to nutrients and used colorful dyes to track the movement of potassium out of the core. With each exposure, more potassium left the core, shifting its electrical charge to be more negative. Once the spores’ cores were negatively charged enough, germination was triggered, like a champagne bottle finally popping its cork. The number of exposures it took to trigger germination varied by spore, just like some corks require more or less twisting to pop. Spores whose potassium movement was hamstrung showed limited change in electric charge and were less likely to “pop” back to life no matter how many nutrients they were exposed to, the team’s experiments showed.</p>



<p>Changes in the electrical charge of a cell are important across the tree of life, from determining when brain cells zip off messages to each other, to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-venus-flytraps-store-short-term-memories-prey">snapping of a Venus flytrap</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Finding that spores also use electrical charges to set their wake-up calls excites Süel. “You want to find principles in biology,” he says, “processes that cross systems, that cross fields and boundaries.”</p>



<p>Spores are not only interesting for their unique and extreme biology, but also for practical applications. Some “can cause some rather nasty things” from food poisoning to anthrax, says Setlow, who was not involved in the study. Since spores are resistant to most antibiotics, understanding germination could lead to a way to bring them back to life in order to kill them for good.</p>



<p>Still, there are many unanswered questions about the “black box” of how spores start germination, like whether it’s possible for the spores to “reset” their potassium count. “We really are in the beginnings of trying to fill in that black box,” says Kaito Kikuchi, a biologist now at Reveal Biosciences in San Diego who conducted the work while at University of California, San Diego. But discovering how spores manage to track their environment while more dead than alive is an exciting start.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jazz-music-swing-rhythm-timing">Here’s where jazz gets its swing</a></h4>

              
                <p>It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing — all you’ve got to do is stagger your timing.</p>



<p>For decades, fans of jazz music have debated why some songs have swing — the characteristic swaying feeling that compels feet to tap and heads to bop. Now, scientists may finally have an answer to Louis Armstrong’s classic song “What Is This Thing Called Swing?” and the secret lies in the timing of jazz soloists.</p>





<p>After listening to original and digitally tweaked piano recordings, jazz musicians were more than seven times as likely to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00995-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rate music as “swinging”</a> when the soloist’s timing was partially delayed with respect to the rhythm section, researchers report October 6 in <em>Communications Physics.</em></p>



<p>In jazz, musicians are trained to swing eighth notes, or extend the duration of their downbeats — every other eighth note — and shorten the beats in between to create a galloping rhythm. But the technique on its own doesn’t explain swing, says physicist Theo Geisel. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program">Computer-generated</a> jazz songs with swung eighth notes still lack the style’s swaying feel (<em>SN: 2/17/22</em>).</p>



<p>Past research hinted that swing might arise from differences in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jazz-improvisers-score-high-creativity">the timing between musicians</a> within a band (<em>SN: 1/2/18</em>). So Geisel and colleagues tweaked only the timing of the soloists in jazz recordings on a computer and asked professional and semiprofessional jazz musicians to rate each recording’s swing.</p>



<p>Musicians were nearly 7.5 times as likely to judge music as more swinging when the soloists’ downbeats were minutely delayed with respect to the rhythm section, but not their offbeats.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Got swing?</h3>



<p>In a new study, jazz musicians rated the “swing” of these recordings of the song “Jordu” by Clifford Brown. The first recording is an unaltered version, and the second recording has been manipulated to increase the delay of the soloist&#8217;s downbeats by a very small amount. The musicians rated the tweaked recording as having more swing than the original.</p>

<p>Most of the musicians couldn’t put their finger on what was causing the effect, says Geisel, of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen, Germany. “Professional jazz musicians who have played for many years apparently have learned to do this unconsciously.”</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed 456 jazz performances from various artists and found almost all soloists used downbeat delays, with an average delay of 30 milliseconds. This average held across the jazz subgenres of bebop, swing and hardbop, though there was some variation, Geisel says. “For faster tempos, the delays get smaller.”</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Geisel intends to investigate how “laid-back playing” — a popular style of delaying both downbeats and offbeats in jazz — influences swing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amphibian-loss-human-malaria-cases-mosquitoes">Losing amphibians may be tied to spikes in human malaria cases</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, Costa Rica and Panama experienced spikes in malaria cases. The massive loss of amphibians in the region from a deadly fungal disease may have contributed to the uptick of this human disease.</p>



<p>The spread of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was a slow-motion disaster, leading to a decades-long wave of amphibian declines globally. From the 1980s to the 2000s, the wave moved from northwest to southeast across Costa Rica and Panama, hitting different places at different times. An analysis of local ecological surveys, public health records and satellite data suggests <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac8e1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link between the amphibian die-offs and an increase in human malaria cases</a> as the wave passed through, researchers report in the October <em>Environmental Research Letters.</em></p>





<p>Teasing out ways that biodiversity loss “ripple[s] through ecosystems and affect[s] humans” can help make a case for preventive actions in the face of other ecological threats, says Michael Springborn, an environmental economist at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>On average, each county in Costa Rica and Panama had 0.8 to 1.1 additional cases of malaria per 1,000 people per year for about six years, beginning a couple of years after the amphibian losses, Springborn and colleagues found. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other research suggests that amphibians serve as important checks on mosquito populations.&nbsp;Amphibian larvae eat mosquito larvae, and the animals compete with each other for resources, such as places to live.</p>



<p>So the missing frogs, toads and salamanders may have led to more mosquitoes and potentially more malaria transmission. But it’s unclear whether mosquito populations actually increased during this time, Springborn says, because those data don’t exist.</p>



<p>Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>or<em> Bd,</em> has led to the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav0379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest recorded loss of biodiversity due to a disease</a>. It’s caused the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll">decline of at least 500 species globally</a> (<em>SN: 3/28/19</em>). Ninety of those species are presumed extinct. Frogs and toads in the Americas and Australia have suffered the greatest declines. The international trade in amphibians has spread the fungus globally.</p>



<p>Springborn and colleagues wondered if the impacts of the amphibian losses stretched to humans too. The researchers turned to Costa Rica and Panama, where the fungus moved through ecosystems in a somewhat uniform way along the narrow strip of land on which the two countries sit, Springborn says. This meant that the researchers could work out when the fungus arrived at a given place. The team also looked at the number of malaria cases in those places before and after the amphibian die-offs.</p>



<p>In the first couple of years after the animals’ decline, malaria cases started to rise. For the following six years or so, cases remained elevated, then started to go down again. The researchers aren’t sure yet what was behind the eventual drop.</p>



<p>Studies on the connections between biodiversity loss and human health might “help motivate conservation by highlighting the direct benefits of conservation to human well-being,” says Hillary Young, a community ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“Humans are causing wildlife to be lost at a rate similar to that of other major mass extinction events,” she says. “We are increasingly aware that these losses can have major impacts on human health and well-being — and, in particular, on risk of infectious disease.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-reptile-relative-fossils-tiny-fast-evolution">Pterosaurs may have evolved from tiny, fast-running reptiles</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious ground-dwelling reptile unearthed in a Scottish sandstone over 100 years ago turns out to be part of a famous flying family. Tiny <em>Scleromochlus taylori</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05284-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a close relative of pterosaurs</a>, the winged reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs, researchers report online October 5 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The finding lends support to the idea that pterosaurs — the first vertebrates to master powered flight — evolved from small, two-legged, speedy ancestors.</p>



<p>The study also offers an answer to a long-standing mystery: What, exactly, was <em>S. taylori</em>? “It all boils down to the preservation of this animal,” says Davide Foffa, a paleontologist at National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh.</p>





<p><em>S. taylori</em> is known entirely from seven individuals preserved in rocks discovered in 1907, fossils that have been difficult to interpret. For one thing, there aren’t any actual bones, just impressions on the surrounding rock; the bones have long since winnowed away. Numerous studies have described and redescribed the creature based on these fossils. And those analyses have in turn suggested that <em>S. taylori</em> was most closely related to dinosaurs, or to pterosaurs, or even to crocodilian ancestors.</p>



<p>What was clear was that the little reptile, which lived about 230 million years ago, had a set of very odd body proportions, Foffa says. At less than 20 centimeters long, “it would fit on the palm of your hand,” but its head was very large for its body. It also had a short neck and long hind limbs. But that rough outline isn’t enough to identify the creature’s closest relatives; that requires finer details of skull, jaw, body proportions and more.</p>



<p>So Foffa and his colleagues used a noninvasive scanning technology called microcomputed tomography to collect previously inaccessible data from the fossils, from the length of its tail to the size of its foot bones to the shape of its jawline.</p>



<p>Some of the creature’s features — like its giant head — are similar to pterosaurs. Others, like the orientation of its lower jaw, aren’t much like pterosaurs at all, the team found.<em> S. taylori</em> didn’t have any identifiable adaptations for flying, jumping or living in trees, the team says. Instead, it was probably a runner.</p>

<p>One of the most important new insights is about the structure of the creature’s femur. It bore strong similarities to both pterosaurs and a group of small, ground-dwelling reptiles called lagerpetids. In particular, the bottom of the femur bone, where it would connect to the lower leg, bears a structure that is a hallmark of lagerpetids, Foffa says.</p>



<p>Taken together, the new data suggest that the creature was almost certainly a lagerpetid. Though lagerpetids didn’t fly, they and pterosaurs <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3011-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have recently been recognized as being very closely related</a>, part of a group collectively called pterosauromorphs. The common ancestor of pterosauromorphs was likely a small, fast-running reptile.</p>



<p><em>S. taylori</em>, which has features of both, may be a very early lagerpetid, evolving soon after those two pterosauromorph lineages split. That it turned out to have so many features present in both was “kind of a surprise,” says Martín Ezcurra, a paleontologist at the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires who was not involved in the new study. But based on the reanalysis of the fossils, the conclusion that <em>S. taylori</em> was an early lagerpetid makes a lot of sense, he says.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs first appear in the fossil record about 220 million years ago, and their anatomy is distinct, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">including massive heads for their body sizes</a> and super-elongated fourth digits which were part of their wings (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>). <em>S. taylori</em> has the big head, but its hands are still small, Ezcurra notes. “We’re missing several intermediate forms in between that bear features related to active flight,” he says. But this new analysis of old fossils does bring scientists just a little bit closer to the time when pterosaurs’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">unique and highly flight-adapted bodies</a> began to evolve (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>It’s difficult to say what such a proto-pterosaur might look like, says Hans Sues, a paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the new study. “<em>Scleromochlus</em> is a tiny animal, and it is conceivable that a related small-bodied form climbed around in trees and eventually gave rise to a proto-pterosaur — perhaps through an intermediate gliding stage.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bioorthogonal-chemists-bertozzi-meldal-sharpless-win-2022-chemistry-nobel">A way to snap molecules together like Lego wins 2022 chemistry Nobel</a></h4>

              
                <p>A toolkit for snapping together molecules like Lego building blocks has won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2022/summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Nobel Prize in chemistry</a>.</p>



<p>Chemists Carolyn Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and Barry Sharpless of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., will evenly split the prize for developing click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 5 in a news conference in Stockholm. These tools allow scientists to easily construct complex molecules in the lab and inside living organisms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="334" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100522_no_nobel-chem_inline1.jpg" alt="Three side-by-side portraits show, respectively, Nobel Chemists Carolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and Barry Sharpless who won the 2022 prize for pioneering click chemistry." class="wp-image-3118028" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100522_no_nobel-chem_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100522_no_nobel-chem_inline1-330x162.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118028"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chemist Carolyn Bertozzi (left) developed bioorthogonal chemistry, while chemists Morten Meldal (middle) and Barry Sharpless (right) pioneered click chemistry.</span></span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118028"><span style="font-weight: 400">L.A. Cicero; Scripps Research; University of Copenhagen</span></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The good thing with this discovery is that it can be used for almost everything,” said Olof Ramström, a chemist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry. Applications include building drug molecules, polymers, new materials and tracking biomolecules among cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re kind of at the tip of the iceberg already in terms of applications,” says Angela Wilson, president of the American Chemical Society. “I think this chemistry is going to revolutionize medicine in so many areas.”</p>





<p>Around 20 years ago, Sharpless introduced “click chemistry” — a way to simply and quickly attach two compounds using certain connector molecules. But finding these Lego-like connector molecules that can bond together in a chemical reaction wasn’t easy. Working independently, Sharpless and Meldal discovered a solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By adding a smidge of copper to a mixture containing two other small molecules — called an azide and an alkyne — the scientists could rapidly snap the two molecules together into a ring-shaped chemical. Without the copper, the molecules would eventually combine, but sluggishly, Ramström said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reaction quickly “gained enormous interest across chemistry and related fields,” he added. Even though scientists would later discover a handful of other molecules that could snap together in the same fashion, that first reaction is considered the “crown jewel of click reactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while catalyzing reactions with copper may work fine in a glass beaker, the metal can harm living cells. Bertozzi discovered a way to do copper-free click chemistry, so scientists can now design chemical reactions inside of organisms without mucking up their normal cellular functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bertozzi tricked cells into incorporating a click chemical into sugars decorating the cell’s surface. When scientists expose these cells to a different click chemical, a type of alkyne, the two can snap together, just like the molecules in Sharpless’ and Meldal’s reactions. By linking the alkyne to green-glowing molecules, scientists can illuminate the surfaces of cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Imagine you could attach shining molecules to biomolecules in a living cell. Then you could follow them in a microscope and see where they are and how they move. This is what Carolyn Bertozzi did,”<strong> </strong>said Johan Åqvist, a theoretical chemist at Uppsala University in Sweden and chair of the Nobel committee for chemistry.</p>



<p>Bertozzi’s specialty has been studying sugar molecules, which “are incredibly difficult to work with,” says Leslie Vosshall, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who is the vice president and chief scientific officer at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Straightforward methods exist for looking at DNA, RNA and proteins, but not so much for sugars, she says. “Sugars are the dark matter of the cell.”</p>



<p>By targeting specific sugars on cell surfaces, scientists can develop new treatments. For instance, Bertozzi and her colleagues were able to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-cells-cast-sweet-spell-immune-system">target and deactivate sugars </a>that were helping tumor cells hide from T cells in the body (<em>SN: 3/21/17</em>).</p>



<p>Bertozzi, an HHMI investigator, is the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/nobel-prize-awarded-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59th woman to win a Nobel Prize since 1901</a>, and just the eighth to be awarded a prize in chemistry. In 2021, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were the last women to win chemistry Nobels, for their work on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">gene-editing tool known as CRISPR</a> (<em>10/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Carolyn is&#8230; one of the astonishingly few women in chemical biology,” Vosshall says. “Her lab has been a generative place that has inspired women chemists and put them out into the world.”</p>



<p>When awakened by the news around 3 a.m. Pacific Time, Bertozzi said, “I’m absolutely stunned. I&#8217;m sitting here and can hardly breathe.” Calling the middle-of-the-night phone call a shock is an understatement, she added. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real, but it’s getting realer by the minute.”</p>



<p>Bertozzi, Meldal and Sharpless will share the prize — 10 million Swedish kronor, roughly $917,000. The award is the second Nobel for Sharpless, who shared the prize in 2001 for his work on <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2001/summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing catalysts for oxidation reactions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Interestingly, significant differences in breast cancer mortality rates have been evidenced among countries, as a result of major global inequalities in distribution and access to optimal care. Although High Income Countries (HICs) have overall higher breast cancer incidence rates, the prognosis of breast cancer has significantly improved in the last decades, with the five-year survival rate exceeding 90%. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have stagnant or increasing mortality rates, as clearly demonstrated by South Africa, where the five-year survival rate is around 40%.</p>

<p>Reasons for these disparate trends include better risk factor control in HICs, educational resources, elevated compliance with screening and surveillance programs with earlier detection of disease. Furthermore, HICs have increased levels of coverage of essential health services and higher numbers of public cancer centers offering more advanced diagnostic techniques and treatments. It is in the low resource scenarios where most of the cases and most of the mortality should be expected in the next few decades and where concerted efforts should attempt to decrease the impact of the disease. In 2015, the United National General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for <a class="is-external" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> built on the principle of “leaving no one behind”. The goals highlighted the importance of fighting inequalities across the world and specifically two goals, SDG3 and SDG10, have the ambitious aim of reducing disparities within and among countries and ensuring healthy lives for all at all ages.</p>
<p>In alignment with this, in 2021 the WHO launched the <a class="is-external" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-03-2021-new-global-breast-cancer-initiative-highlights-renewed-commitment-to-improve-survival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI)</a>. This strategic collaboration seeks to empower women and strengthen breast cancer control with the final goal of tackling disparities in breast cancer management and reducing the global mortality by 2.5% per year by 2040. The GBCI aims to achieve these objectives through three pillars: health promotions for early detection; timely diagnosis and comprehensive breast cancer management. Through these pillars the WHO clearly acknowledges that effective global breast cancer treatment primarily relies on early detection, accurate diagnosis, and access to multimodal cancer therapy, with emphasis placed on early detection as pivotal to cancer control in LMICs.</p>
<p>On occasion of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and as part of <a class="is-external" href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/sdg-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our role </a>in promoting progress towards achieving the SDGs, <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Cancer</em></a> has curated a <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/breast-cancer-awareness-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection of articles </a>that emphasize the importance of early detection and effective screening programs in global breast cancer management.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13013" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13013" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 276px"><img class="wp-image-13013 " src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_422714239-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="150" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_422714239-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_422714239-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_422714239-640x360.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_422714239.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13013" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Gorodenkoff / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>As highlighted in a few studies included in the collection, public campaigns raising attention to women&#8217;s health, the education and training of the healthcare workforce and the improved access to primary care play key roles in implementing effective screening programs. For instance, <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-022-09311-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarker and colleagues</a> reported the effectiveness of an educational intervention program on breast cancer knowledge among young female students of a university in Bangladesh. Thus, increasing awareness among women of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, improving health literacy and patient education are vital aspects for diagnosing at least 60% of invasive breast cancer at stage I or II – the aim set out by the GBCI.</p>
<p>At the same time, the success of screening interventions relies on the participation of the target population. As a result, new screening programs must be acceptable, equitable, accessible, sustainable, and economically efficient for target populations. Additionally, one of the main criteria of a good screening programs is that the overall benefits should outweigh the physical, psychological and financial harms. This is well addressed in the study protocol published by <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-022-09484-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roux and colleagues</a> where the ethical, psychological and socio-economic impact of a new risk-stratified screening strategy will be investigated.</p>

<p>Besides accessible care, accuracy of the initial diagnosis is another objective of all programs, requiring increasing resources and training. Particularly, great efforts are currently focused on the development of advanced diagnostic tools and the identification of new effective biomarkers. Interestingly, liquid biopsy has been suggested as a promising tool that would afford timely and non-invasive assessment of breast cancer also in LMICs, through the identification of different kinds of tumor material &#8211; such as nucleic acids, proteins, extracellular vesicles and whole cells &#8211; in various biofluids. In this regards, <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-022-09428-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shewell and colleagues</a> and <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-09055-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee and colleagues</a> identified new serum breast cancer biomarkers, while <a class="is-external" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08870-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ekstrӧm and colleagues</a> demonstrated the potential use of extracellular vesicles from lymphatic drainage for disease monitoring.</p>

                <p>Researchers led by Matthew Fuxjager at Brown University, U.S. and Eric Schuppe at Wake Forest University, U.S. have found regions in the woodpecker forebrain that show characteristics that until now have only been associated with vocal learning in animals and language in humans. The new <em>PLOS Biology</em> study revealed that instead of being related to vocalization, activity in these brain regions is related to the characteristic tree drumming that gives woodpeckers their name.

<p>STUDY DESIGN AND FINDINGS</p>



<p>Scientists study songbirds because human language and birdsong have many similarities. Both are learned when young, require complex muscle coordination, and are controlled by specialized regions of the brain. Both humans and songbirds express a marker gene in these regions called <em>PV</em> (parvalbumin), which has never been found in discrete nuclei within the forebrain of vocal birds that do not learn their vocalizations. However, when checking for <em>PV</em> gene expression in several types of birds that had not previously been examined (including flamingos, ducks, penguins, and woodpeckers) the researchers surprisingly found that woodpeckers do have specialized regions of the brain that make parvalbumin. Furthermore, they found that these areas are similar in number and location to several of the forebrain nuclei that control song learning and production in songbirds. In additional open field tests with woodpeckers, they discovered that the birds&rsquo; behavior that triggered brain activity in these regions was actually their rapid drumming, and not their vocalizations.</p>



<p>FURTHER INSIGHTS</p>



<p>Like birdsong, woodpecker drumming is used to defend territories, requires rapid and complex motor movements, and must be adaptable when birds compete with each other. Although scientists have not yet established that drumming is a learned behavior, this new evidence from the brain predicts that it is. Finding this system for non-vocal communication that is both neurologically and functionally similar to the song system can help us understand how existing brain systems evolve and become co-opted for new, but similar functions.</p>



<p>Fuxjager adds, &ldquo;Woodpeckers have a set of specialized brain areas that control their ability to drum, or rapidly hammer their bill on trees (and gutters!) during fights with other birds. Furthermore, these brain areas look remarkably similar to the parts of the brain in songbirds that help these animals learn to sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982164362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breathless</a><br><em>David Quammen</em><br><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, $29.99</em></p>



<p>When COVID-19 burst onto the global stage in 2020, it was deadly and disruptive. In the first weeks of January, researchers identified the cause: A coronavirus was to blame, a relative of the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. Echoes of what had happened nearly 20 years earlier — thousands were infected and at least 774 people died before the SARS outbreak was brought under control — sent ripples of anxiety throughout the virology world.</p>





<p>Scientists of all backgrounds rushed to understand the new scourge, dubbed SARS-CoV-2. Hospitals around the world were soon overwhelmed, and daily life for billions of people was thrown into disarray. Quarantine, isolation, N95 masks and social distancing entered our collective lexicon. <em>Breathless</em>, by science writer David Quammen, takes readers along on the ensuing two-year scientific roller coaster.</p>



<p>The book is a portrait of the virus — SARS-CoV-2’s early days in China, how decades of science helped researchers craft effective vaccines within a year, the arrival of highly mutated variants. It’s not about the societal upheaval or the public health failures (and successes). While Quammen acknowledges the importance of those aspects of the pandemic, he chooses to focus on the “firehose” of scientific studies — both good and bad — that drove our understanding of COVID-19.</p>





<p>He dives deep into one of the pandemic’s most controversial questions: Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from? Nature or the lab? Quammen describes the saga in elaborate detail. First there were worries that some of the virus’s features appeared engineered. Those concerns were quickly dispelled when researchers found those features in viruses from wild bats and pangolins. Then there was the thought that workers in a lab studying bat viruses could have become accidentally infected and unknowingly spread the virus to others.</p>



<p>Rather than dismiss that accidental lab leak hypothesis, Quammen takes readers step by step through the genetic and epidemiological data. That includes recent evidence supporting the scenario that the virus emerged — <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perhaps in two separate jumps</a> — from an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknown animal at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market</a> in Wuhan, China. Through his conversations with experts in virus ecology and evolution, readers learn the nuances of how virologists do research and the controversies of gain-of-function studies that test what happens when viruses acquire new traits. Quammen’s conclusion: An accidental lab leak is not impossible. “But it seems unlikely.”</p>



<p>To understand the pandemic, Quammen draws on lessons learned from our previous run-ins with coronaviruses, including the SARS outbreak and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-double-dose-virus-scares">2012 MERS outbreak</a> in the Middle East (<em>SN: 12/28/13, p. 23</em>). Part of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spillover-animal-infections-and-next-human-pandemic">his 2012 book <em>Spillover</em></a> focused on the bat origin of the SARS outbreak (<em>SN: 10/20/12, p. 30</em>). That tome is unnervingly prescient. If the original SARS coronavirus had been most contagious before symptoms began, Quammen wrote in <em>Spillover</em>, officials would have had a much harder time ending the outbreak. “It would be a much darker story,” he wrote. But that’s exactly what happened with SARS-CoV-2. People can pass the virus to others before knowing they are sick, a trait that helped COVID-19 spiral out of control.</p>



<p>As a science journalist who has followed SARS-CoV-2 since its discovery, I found <em>Breathless</em> to be surprisingly cathartic. My memories of the last few years have blurred together. <em>Breathless</em> presents the sweeping scientific story of the pandemic, connecting puzzle pieces that at the time had felt so out of place.</p>



<p>Some readers may feel it’s too soon to scrutinize a pandemic that isn’t even over. But SARS-CoV-2 certainly won’t be the last harmful virus to emerge. Quammen puts the pandemic in the context of the coronavirus scares that came before to highlight how science builds on itself. And one thing is certain: There will be another. “There are many more fearsome viruses where SARS-CoV-2 came from,” he writes, “wherever that was.” </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-prize-2022-quantum-entanglement-tech">Quantum experiments with entangled photons win the 2022 Nobel Prize in physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tests of quantum weirdness and its potential real-world applications have been recognized with the 2022 Nobel Prize in physics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At some level we are all subject to quantum rules that even Albert Einstein struggled to come to terms with. For the most part, these rules play out behind the scenes in transistors that make up computer chips, lasers and even in the chemistry of atoms and molecules in materials all around us. Applications that stem from this year’s Nobel Prize take advantage of quantum features at larger scales. They include absolutely secure communications and quantum computers that may eventually solve problems that no conceivable conventional computer could complete in the lifetime of the universe.</p>





<p>This year’s prize is shared among three physicists. Alain Aspect and John Clauser confirmed that the rules of quantum mechanics, as weird and difficult to believe as they are, really do rule the world, while Anton Zeilinger has taken advantage of strange quantum behavior to develop rudimentary applications that no conventional technology can match. Each laureate will take home a third of the prize money, which totals 10 million Swedish kronor, worth roughly $915,000 as of October 4.</p>





<p>“Today, we honor three physicists whose pioneering experiments showed us that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/75-years-entanglement">strange world of entanglement</a> … is not just the micro-world of atoms, and certainly not the virtual world of science fiction or mysticism, but it’s the real world that we all live in,” said Thors Hans Hansson, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, at a press conference announcing the award on October 4 at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (<em>SN: 11/5/10</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was certainly very exciting to learn about the three laureates,” says physicist Jerry Chow of IBM Quantum in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. “Aspect, Zeilinger and Clauser — they’re all very, very well known in our quantum community, and their work is something that’s really been a big part of many people’s research efforts over many years.”</p>



<p>Aspect, of the Université Paris-Saclay and École Polytechnique in France, and Clauser, who now runs a company in California, showed that there are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/bells-math-showed-quantum-weirdness-rang-true">no secret back channels</a> of communication that explain how two particles can exist as a single entity, even though they are far apart (<em>SN: 12/29/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experiments of Zeilinger, of the University of Vienna, that rely on that quantum behavior include demonstrations of communications, absolutely secure encryption and components crucial for quantum computers. He pioneered another, widely misunderstood, application — quantum teleportation. Unlike the teleportation of people and objects in science fiction, the effect involves the perfect transmission of information about a quantum object from one place to another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I was always interested in quantum mechanics from the very first moments when I read about it,” Zeilinger said via phone at the news conference announcing the award. “I was actually struck by some of the theoretical predictions, because they did not fit the usual intuitions which one might have.”</p>



<p>The discovery of quantum behavior that rules the world at small scales, like the motion of an electron around an atom, revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20th century. Many leading scientists, most famously including Einstein, acknowledged that quantum theories worked, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-theory-history-reality-uncertainty-physics">argued that they couldn’t be the true description</a> of the world because they involved, at best, calculating the probabilities that something would happen (<em>SN: 1/12/22</em>). To Einstein, this meant that there was some hidden information that experiments were too crude to uncover.</p>



<p>Others believed that quantum behavior, derogatively called weirdness, though difficult to understand, had no secret ways of transmitting information. It was largely a matter of opinion and debate until physicist John Bell <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/bells-math-showed-quantum-weirdness-rang-true">proposed a test in the 1960s</a> to prove that there were no hidden channels of communication among quantum objects (<em>SN: 12/29/14</em>). At the time it wasn’t clear that an experiment to perform the test was possible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="475" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100422_jr_nobel-physics_inline2_rev.jpg" alt="black and white image of John Clauser at work in a lab" class="wp-image-3117967" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100422_jr_nobel-physics_inline2_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100422_jr_nobel-physics_inline2_rev-548x383.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100422_jr_nobel-physics_inline2_rev-644x450.jpg 644w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100422_jr_nobel-physics_inline2_rev-266x186.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117967">John Clauser developed the first practical experiment to confirm Bell’s test to show there are no secret channels of communication among quantum objects.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117967">University of California Graphic Arts/Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clauser was the first to develop a practical experiment to confirm Bell’s test, although there remained loopholes his experiment couldn’t check that left room for doubt. (His interest in science developed early. In 1959 and 1960, Clauser <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fair-winners-2">competed in the National Science Fair</a>, now known as the International Science and Engineering Fair (<em>SN: 5/23/59</em>). The fair is run by the Society for Science, which publishes <em>Science News</em>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aspect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gods-dice-fall">took the idea further</a> to eliminate any chance that quantum mechanics had some hidden underpinnings of classical physics (<em>SN: 1/11/86</em>). The experiments of Clauser and Aspect involved creating pairs of photons that were entangled, meaning that they were essentially a single object. As the photons moved in different directions, they remained entangled. That is, they continue to exist as a single, extended object. Measuring the characteristics of one instantly reveals characteristics of the other, no matter how far apart they may be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entanglement is a delicate state of affairs and is difficult to maintain, but the results of the experiments of Clauser and Aspect show that quantum effects cannot be explained with any hidden variables that would be signs of non-quantum underpinnings.</p>

<p>To Chow, the significance of this research is twofold. “There’s really an element of showing, from a philosophical point, that quantum mechanics is real,” he says. “But then, from the more practical standpoint … this same beautiful theory of quantum mechanics gives a different set of rules by which information is processed.” That, in turn, opens up new avenues for next-generation technologies like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-light-based-quantum-computer-jiuzhang-supremacy">quantum computers</a> and communications (<em>SN: 12/3/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zeilinger’s experiments take advantage of entanglement to achieve feats that would not be possible without the effects that Clauser and Aspect confirmed. He has extended the experiments from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-teleportation-leaps-forward">lab to intercontinental distances</a>, opening up the possibility that entanglement can be put to practical use (<em>SN: 5/31/12</em>). Because interacting with one of a pair of entangled particles affects the other, they can become key components in secure communications and encryption. An outsider trying to listen in on a quantum communique would be revealed because they would break the entanglement as they snooped.</p>



<p>Quantum computers that rely on entangled particles have also become a topic of active research. Instead of the ones and zeros of conventional computers, quantum computers encode information and perform calculations that are blends of both one and zero. In theory, they can perform some calculations that no digital computer could ever match. Zeilinger’s quantum <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/instant-transport">teleportation experiments</a> offer a route to transfer the information that such quantum computers rely on (<em>SN: 1/17/98</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This [award] is a very nice and positive surprise to me,” says Nicolas Gisin, a physicist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. “This prize is very well-deserved, but comes a bit late. Most of that work was done in the [1970s and 1980s], but the Nobel Committee was very slow, and now is rushing after the boom of quantum technologies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That boom is happening on a global scale, Gisin says. “In the U.S. and in Europe and in China, billions — literally billions of dollars are poured into this field. So, it’s changing completely,” he says. “Instead of having a few individuals pioneering the field, now we have really huge crowds of physicists and engineers that work together.”</p>



<p>Although some of the most esoteric quantum applications are in their infancy, the experiments of Clauser, Aspect and Zeilinger bring quantum mechanics, and its strange implications, to the macroscopic world. Their contributions validate some of the key, once controversial ideas of quantum mechanics and promise novel applications that may someday be commonplace in daily life, in ways that even Einstein couldn’t deny.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-head-neck-launch-video-footage">Video captures young mosquitoes launching their heads to eat other mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                <p>A kind of teenager mosquito can suddenly shoot its head forward from its body — stretching its neck into a skinny cord — to bite into another youngster. And that’s just one of the ways young mosquitoes kill other mosquitoes, a new study shows.</p>



<p>Over decades, scientist-cinematographer Robert Hancock and colleagues have filmed attacks by these <em>Psorophora ciliata </em>and two other kinds of predatory mosquito larvae in unusual detail. Launching heads evolved independently in two of the kinds, he and colleagues say in their new study.</p>





<p>The third predator, a kind of <em>Sabethes</em> mosquito larva, uses its other end. Hanging head down in water, it needs only 15 milliseconds <a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Faesa%2Fsaac017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to grip prey with a hooking sweep of the breathing tube on its predatory butt</a>, the researchers report October 4 in <em>Annals of the Entomological Society of America</em>.</p>



<p>The most dramatic pounce on film may be the neck-stretching snatch by the <em>Psorophora</em> larva. It might power this lunge by squeezing a rush of fluid to the head. When Hancock watches the mosquito&#8217;s body, segmented a bit like a string of alphabet-block beads, he can see two segments scrunching inward “accordion-like,” as if squirting fluid forward as the head shoots out.</p>



<p>Launching the head to reach the prey is one thing, but catching hold is another problem. The newly released video gives a clear view of a pair of brushes, one on each side of the head, that help with the grasp. As the head nears its victim, the brushes fan out into what the researchers call a “flimsy basketlike arrangement” that folds around the doomed prey.</p>



<p>Such an attack may startle people thinking of mosquito bites just as stealthy hypodermic blood-sucks. That’s the adult bite from females craving a nutritional supplement for egg-laying. Mosquito eggs, however, hatch in water, and larvae don’t assume their dandelion-wisp flying form for weeks. During the aquatic phase, these larvae don’t look, or dine, like adult forms at all.</p>



<p>Larvae don’t bite people, and many just filter out edible crumbs afloat in water. The meat eaters, however, pounce so fast that the human brain can’t parse it. Hancock has been fascinated ever since he was in a class in the 1980s seeing only a blur through the microscope as he tried to describe the feeding behavior. The <em>Toxorhynchites </em>mosquitoes that frustrated him then have turned out to be one of the groups that evolved head-launching larvae.</p>

</div><figcaption>Mosquito larvae don’t look anything like their adult counterparts. And unlike adults, the young insects are voracious meat eaters, often preying on other mosquito larvae. Now, high-speed video reveals those hunts in new detail. In the first clip, a <em>Psorophora </em>mosquito larva launches its blocky head to snare a different mosquito species snack. In the second clip, a <em>Sabethes </em>larva uses the breathing tube on its butt to hook a meal.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>“</strong>If there&#8217;s any mosquito for all the mosquito haters to actually maybe not love but like, it&#8217;s <em>Toxorhynchites</em>,” says Hancock, now at Metropolitan State University of Denver. As iridescent adults they’re vegans, feeding largely on flower nectar. For larvae, it’s all meat, mostly other mosquitoes. Plus, he says, “They’re large, and they’re gorgeous.”</p>



<p>The new study found that the launch doesn’t extend as far as a head length, but <em>Toxorhynchites</em> attacks the prey larva vigorously. In the videos, “by the time you would catch sight of it, there would be like a half of larva &#8230; as it shoved this thing in like it was a hot dog eating contest,” Hancock says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and colleagues also caught on film a third kind of meat-eating mosquito, <em>Sabethes</em>, which are more flexitarian than carnivore. They still eat their meat at their head end, but the danger of getting snagged comes from their rear, the researchers’ videos show. Like many mosquito larvae, they often dangle head down in the water, taking in oxygen through a flexible siphon. It turns out that the breathing tube doubles as a type of food hook, capable of snaring a target in only several milliseconds.</p>



<p>“The thing about <em>Sabethes</em> is that they&#8217;re probably more like murderers because they really don&#8217;t ingest and consume entire prey larvae like the other two,” Hancock says. Feeding tests show that the insects do gain at least some nutrition from the nibbling.</p>



<p>A human watching the larvae hunt may wonder why we put so much money and chemistry into trying to kill the pests when their own tiny relatives do it so brilliantly. For one thing, mosquito larvae stay underwater, says entomologist Don Yee of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, who wasn’t involved in the study. The two neck-stretcher groups can’t lift into the air and fly to the next water-filled tire or tree hole. There, a <em>Toxorhynchites</em>, for instance, “likely would consume all other larvae,” he says. “[H]owever, there may be hundreds of such containers in the area.”</p>



<p>In contrast, the neck-stretching <em>Psorophora </em>mosquitoes live in larger bodies of water and could theoretically have more of an effect at knocking back mosquito numbers, Yee says. But under natural circumstances, the predators are unlikely to crash mosquito populations as humans would want. Yee compares it to the African savanna. In photos, “you can see how many wildebeest there are. The lions can’t really control them.” In nature, after all, predators that thrive don’t wipe out their own prey.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">Despite a retraction, a room-temperature superconductor claim isn’t dead yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>It may be too soon to mourn the demise of a room-temperature superconductivity claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 26, the journal <em>Nature</em> retracted a paper describing a material that seemed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">to turn into a superconductor at a cozy 15° Celsius</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/20)</em>. The notice rattled many people in the field. But a new experiment performed just days after the retraction supports the world-record temperature claim, say an eyewitness and others familiar with the experiment.</p>



<p>Superconductors carry electricity with no resistance, which means they’re useful for efficiently transmitting energy. They could save enormous amounts of energy that’s wasted in conventional metal wires. Currently they are used to create powerful magnetic fields for medical imaging and particle physics experiments, as well as serving as components in high-performance circuity and even levitating high-speed trains. But to work, superconducting materials generally must be cooled far below 0° C, and many to temperatures close to absolute zero, or -273° C.</p>





<p>When researchers announced in 2020 that a sample made of hydrogen, sulfur and a bit of carbon <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2801-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a superconductor at record-shattering temperatures</a>, dreams of room-temperature superconducting seemed to be on the verge of coming true. One hitch was that the material had to be under enormous pressures, about 2.6 million times atmospheric pressures — roughly the pressure found in parts of Earth’s core. Still, the discovery hailed a potential scientific and technological revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the two years since, controversy has swirled around the report. The maelstrom is centered on the way the researchers prepared and processed data that showed changes in a magnetic property known as susceptibility. Ultimately, editors at <em>Nature </em>took the unusual step of retracting the paper despite the researchers’ objections.&nbsp;“We have now established that some key data processing steps … used a non-standard, user-defined procedure,” write the editors at <em>Nature</em> in the retraction. “The details of the procedure were not specified in the paper and the validity of the background subtraction has subsequently been called into question.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new experiment isn’t a duplicate of the one reported in the retracted paper, but the researchers replicated a portion of their research that raised red flags in the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester who headed the research on the now-retracted paper, led the new measurements at Argonne National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source in Lemont, Ill. “We have been working on this experiment for almost six months, building and reconfirming the correct methodology,” Dias says. “I would say the data we obtained at Argonne is more compelling, not just comparable,” to the data in the retracted <em>Nature</em> paper.</p>



<p>“The experiment took place over two days, September 27 and 28,” says physicist Nilesh Salke of the University of Illinois Chicago, who was not affiliated with the original research. Salke’s role at Argonne involved probing a sample of the material in question with X-rays while it was exhibiting magnetic susceptibility associated with high-temperature superconductivity. “We saw the first susceptibility signal on September 27, consistent with the claims reported in the retracted <em>Nature </em>paper.”</p>



<p>This latest twist is unlikely to put an end to the controversy that came with the initial claim, at least in the mind of physicist Jorge Hirsch of the University of California, San Diego. Hirsch has been one of the most vocal critics of the room-temperature superconductivity claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t know it would be retracted, but was hoping it would be retracted,” says Hirsch, who was not affiliated with either the original or new experiment. He says he asked the authors for the raw data from the earlier study one month after it was published, but he was refused. “The authors said, ‘No we cannot give you the data because our lawyers said that it would affect our patent rights.’”</p>



<p>With intervention from <em>Nature</em>, Hirsch eventually got the numbers. What he saw disturbed him. Hirsch is skeptical that high-temperature superconductivity is possible in these sorts of hydrogen-based materials in general, but says he is objecting based on the way the data were handled.</p>



<p>“There were real problems between the raw data and the published data,” Hirsch says. He believes that <em>Nature</em>’s retraction doesn’t go far enough. “It’s not that the data were not properly processed.” Along with physicist Dirk van der Marel of the University of Geneva, Hirsch <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217979223750012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delves into problems with the data</a> in a paper published September 15 in the <em>International Journal of Modern Physics B</em>. “Our analysis proves mathematically that the raw data were not measured in the laboratory. They were fabricated.”</p>



<p>Dias and colleagues deny any impropriety in their data or analysis and are moving forward with experiments like the one at Argonne. But that work awaits peer review. For now, <em>Nature</em>’s retraction bolsters existing doubts around room-temperature superconductivity.</p>



<p>“In the end, all of this has to be validated by different groups getting the answer,” Hirsch says.</p>
