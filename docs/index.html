<p>In an effort to fight global poverty, the United Nations has launched the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> project to encourage countries to ‘mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind’. A major part of this process is ensuring the availability of data on key development indicators to assess inequalities between and within countries and determine how these change over time. Monitoring health inequalities can uncover the effect of health policies, programs and interventions on specific disadvantaged subgroups and involves collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting various types of health data. This article describes a toolkit developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to display and assess the health inequalities in any given country: the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/assessment_toolkit/en/">Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT)</a>.</p>
<p>HEAT contains data from the WHO’s He<img alt="World Globe and Stethoscope on White Background" class="size-medium wp-image-8268 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Globe-and-stethoscope-300x200.jpg" width="300" />alth Equity Monitor database which includes information from 94 low- or middle-income countries. The software allows the assessment of inequalities within a country using over 30 reproductive, maternal, new-born and child health indicators and five dimensions of inequality (economic status, education, place of residence, sub-national region and child’s sex) providing information about health interventions and health outcomes. The development of the toolkit marks a huge step forward in the monitoring of health inequalities which could in the future help to inform policy makers and national priority-setting for healthcare.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0232-1">How does the choice of database affect the results of a meta-analysis?</a></p>

One of the most important methodological considerations is how the literature is searched, including how many and which bibliographic databases should be used. There is limited quantitative evidence to guide this process, so the authors of this study set out to investigate the effect of selective database searching on the results of meta-analyses. Their study revealed that meta-analysis results generally did not differ significantly when different combinations of databases were searched and that the majority of relevant studies can be found within a limited number of databases. The study provides information which can be used to increase the efficiency of systematic reviews, and provides further guidance for the assessment and development of more recent forms of knowledge synthesis such as <a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-4053-1-10">rapid reviews</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0247-7">Why sex and gender matter in implementation science</a></p>
<p>Researchers are being encouraged more and more to take sex and gender into account when carrying out medical research. This debate article considers the progress that has been made in taking sex and gender into account in implementation science, which considers how research findings are put into practice. A review of the current literature, including assessment of the top ten articles published in the journal <a href="http://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Implementation Science</em></a> in 2015, revealed that few studies mention sex and gender as a consideration. This is despite the fact that there is now guidance on these considerations available from groups such as the <a href="http://methods.cochrane.org/equity/welcome">Cochrane Collaboration’s Methods Equity group</a>.</p>
<p>The article then goes on to define the difference between sex and gender; the former being a classification based on the biology of the individual (according to genetics, anatomy and physiology) and the latter being a construct that is fluid and influenced by social and cultural context. Whilst biological sex is generally simple to measure, the measurement of an individual’s gender is more nuanced with the authors separating it into four constructs: gender roles, gender identity, gender relations and institutionalised gender. They highlight the need for both the qualitative and quantitative measurement of these factors in order to inform implementation research methods. They describe their importance at multiple points along the implementation process, from the content and messaging surrounding an intervention, to decision making around the uptake of an intervention.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-015-0105-z">Guidance for evidence mapping methodology</a></p>
<p>Evidence sy<img alt="Attributed to iStock - Manuscripts" class="size-medium wp-image-6095 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/01/Manuscripts-256x300.jpg" width="256" />nthesis methods are used to analyse the literature and gain an overall summary of the results obtained from multiple studies on a specific topic or intervention. The classic methods of meta-analysis and systematic review can be labour intensive and so researchers are investigating ways to simplify this process whilst still maintaining accuracy and rigour. An emerging evidence synthesis method is evidence mapping which can be used as a first step in conducting a broad systematic review and can clarify where there is sufficient evidence to inform policy makers as well as identify research dense areas where systematic reviews could be pursued. Areas where there is a lack of evidence can also be identified, known as research gaps, where further studies may be needed.</p>
<p>There are currently no methodological standards for evidence mapping which led the authors of this study to describe the process and methodology of creating an evidence map database using the topic of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) and selected health outcomes of interest as an example. With the help of a stakeholder panel, a comprehensive literature search strategy was developed and refined. Outcomes from the studies identified in this search were classified into clinically and biologically meaningful outcome categories which were then analysed to identify how data have been reported on each outcome and where there are research gaps. Assessment of the frequency of publications in each outcome category revealed areas where research outputs increased over specific periods of time. An example of a research gap that was uncovered was the assessment of appetite and dietary intake outcomes using a LCS intervention with a sugar intake comparison in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>The steps presented in this article can be applied to create an evidence map database for any research topic of interest. Through the creation of this database, researchers and practitioners can easily acquire information necessary for decision-making, such as directions for future research and the basis for evidence synthesis, in a fraction of the time needed to conduct comprehensive literature reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0203-6">How to be both a clinician and a researcher</a></p>
<p><img alt="doctor-computer-smartphone-and-patient" class="alignleft wp-image-8282 size-medium" height="228" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Doctor-computer-smartphone-and-patient-300x228.jpg" title="Istock photo" width="300" />Health research is frequently carried out in a clinical setting with clinicians being directly involved in the research process. This brings many benefits including increasing the clinical relevance of research questions, gaining access to clinical settings for research, and bringing clinical expertise and insider perspectives. However, there are ethical and methodological implications that should be considered when clinicians undertake a research role. In this study, the authors systematically reviewed published articles looking at the clinician-researcher dual-role and summarise the key findings from the literature.</p>
<p>The main finding was that clinician-researchers cannot adopt a wholly non-clinical research identity. This was attributed to the fact that it was not possible to maintain a strict researcher-participant relationship when the participant had previously been treated as a patient by the clinician-researcher. Consciously and subconsciously, the clinician and patient roles are present in the research setting, creating shared ground and a connection that resembles a clinician-patient relationship. Clinicians also described their struggles with separating themselves from the clinical role when carrying out research, suggesting that there are deep rooted characteristics which cannot be shed when a clinician moves into a research context. The authors recommend that clinician-researchers should be encouraged to accept and explore the factors surrounding the dual-role phenomenon, consider both roles throughout the research process, and ensure that clinical and research roles are not artificially separated in research protocols, ethics applications, and research practice.</p>

<p>Exposing your body to cold water has been promoted as a health tonic since at least the Roman period, so it’s about time we gave this a thorough investigation. In <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161749">a new paper</a> in <em>PLOS One</em> Geert Buijze and his colleagues report on the health and wellbeing effects of the “cool challenge” – a 30-day event in the Netherlands that involved more than 3000 people taking daily showers that ran cold for at least the last 30 seconds each time.</p>
<p>The clearest finding was a 29 per cent reduction in sickness absence for those who took cold showers compared with their colleagues who weren’t involved in the challenge; the length of the cold blast, whether 30 seconds or 90, didn’t matter. However cold showers didn’t provide an immunisation against sickness as such. The challenge participants felt ill as frequently as their colleagues, it’s just that somehow they were better able to fight through it and make it to work.</p>
<p>Most of the psychological factors that the researchers measured were not influenced by the chilly treatment. Participants reported a small increase in quality of life after 30 days, but that disappeared when re-measured later; meanwhile work productivity and levels of anxiety were unaffected. But the participants did report some other benefits such as higher energy levels, comparable to drinking a coffee, and over two thirds chose to continue the challenge for a further two months.</p>
<p>On this evidence, cold showers don’t refresh all the parts we might desire, but seem to insulate against the effects of illness and provide some yet to be determined energetic effects. Why? Maybe thanks to effects on the levels of hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine, which respond in the short-term to a cold dousing. Or simply the benefit of a short daily physical activity – the power of a good shiver.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk">The British Psychological Society - Research Digest</a> on December 15, 2016 11:02 AM.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p><em><img alt="human head model with open window on side idea concept" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15624" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-599252754.jpg?w=845" />By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://clippings.me/users/d_a_robson">David Robson</a></p>
<p>If you want to maximise a person’s intellectual potential, the general consensus for a long time has been that you need to start young. According to this traditional view, early childhood offers a precious “window of opportunity” or “sensitive period” for learning that closes slowly as we reach adolescence. It’s the reason that toddlers find it easier to master the accent of a foreign language, for instance.</p>
<p>This view has even shaped educational policy. If you want to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds, for instance, some psychologists had argued that you would do better to target primary schools, with <a href="http://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/Heckman_Science_v312_2006.pdf">diminishing returns for interventions later in life</a>, as if badly performing <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962201-1/fulltext?rss=yes">teenagers were something of a lost cause</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah-Jayne Blakemore at University College London has spent the last decade <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain">over-turning some of these assumptions</a>, showing that the adolescent brain is still remarkably flexible as it <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jayne_blakemore_the_mysterious_workings_of_the_adolescent_brain">undergoes profound anatomical changes</a>. “The idea that the brain is somehow fixed in early childhood, which was an idea that was very strongly believed up until fairly recently, is completely wrong,” she told <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain"><em>Edge</em> in 2012</a>. The transformation is particularly marked in the prefrontal lobes (located behind the forehead) and the parietal lobes (underneath and just behind the top of your head) – two regions that are involved in abstract thought.</p>
<p>The upshot is that teenagers may go through a second sensitive period, in which they are particularly responsive to certain kinds of intellectual stimulation. A new <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/12/1620">paper</a> from Blakemore’s lab, published in <em>Psychological Science,</em> builds on this idea, showing that our ability to learn certain kinds of analytical skills doesn’t diminish after childhood, but actually increases through adolescence and into early adulthood.</p>
<p><span id="more-15601"></span></p>
<p><img alt="ravens" class=" size-full wp-image-15613 alignleft" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/ravens.png?w=845" />The team – led by Lisa Knoll – recruited more than 600 participants aged 11 to 33, and randomly assigned them to three groups, each trained in a different skill. They taught the first group “numerosity discrimination”, which involved rapidly guessing the number of coloured dots to appear on a screen. They trained the second group in “relational reasoning”: the ability to detect abstract rules and relationships using the kind of non-verbal puzzles (known as Raven’s Matrices) that are common in some IQ tests (see image left). The third group, meanwhile, honed their facial perception: they judged repeatedly whether two photos, shown in rapid succession, represented the same person or not.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that these skills don’t require any advanced factual knowledge. Instead, they represent a broader capacity for abstract thought and pattern recognition that might be useful for many kinds of academic work.</p>
<p>The online training sessions were short but frequent, lasting a maximum of 12 minutes a day for 20 days. The participants were then tested – with the same kinds of puzzles used in training – shortly after they had finished their last session, and again a few months later, to see whether the skills had stuck</p>
<p>Sadly, the participants in the third group would have been disappointed if they ever had hopes of being a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/05/metropolitan-police-super-recognisers">super-recogniser</a>” – their facial perception showed next to no improvement.</p>
<p>But the hard work paid off for many of the other participants – those learning the relational reasoning and the numerosity discrimination had all boosted their scores. Based on these successes, Blakemore, Knoll and colleagues next examined whether those gains depended on the participants’ age.</p>
<p>According to the accepted wisdom, they should have seen the greatest dividends among the youngest subjects aged 11-13, when they were closest to that childhood window of opportunity. But as the psychologists had expected, the older participants turned out to gain the most from the training. The late adolescents (aged 16-18) improved their relational reasoning by around 10 per cent, for instance – nearly twice the gains of younger participants. Even the adults in the group tended to perform better than the youngsters, suggesting that our 20s and early 30s may still be a fertile time for self-improvement.</p>
<p>At least in these kinds of analytical skills, the window of opportunity was still wide open, perhaps reflecting the greater neuroplasticity – the ability to forge new neural circuits – of the prefrontal cortex that Blakemore had previously observed in the brain scans. If so, it supports her idea that we may have multiple sensitive periods for different kinds of skills depending on the brain’s development at that time. As one window of opportunity closes, another may open.</p>
<p>There are other potential explanations, though. The researchers tried to control for the participants’ motivation, showing that the results still held when you took into account the number of completed training sessions. It seems the older participants weren’t just trying harder. But it’s also possible that the teenagers and adults had developed better cognitive strategies for learning: deliberate mental procedures that don’t necessarily reflect greater anatomical plasticity.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">recent controversies surrounding brain training</a>, it’s also worth noting that we don’t know whether these improvements led to meaningful changes in other areas of the participants’ lives. Blakemore and Knoll couldn’t find any corresponding boost in working memory, for instance, and we don’t know if these abstract analytical skills would correspond to a greater aptitude for mathematics or science at school or university.</p>
<p>Even so, I’m intrigued about the potential implications and the promise this holds for future research, adding further evidence to the growing body of work showing that adolescence is a fascinating and potentially fertile period of intellectual growth. Contrary to our <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11410483/Revealed-the-science-behind-teenage-laziness.html">sometimes dim view of teenagers</a>, there’s much more to those years than the acne and the angst.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="A happy couple runs through waves on sunlit beach" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15595" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-167408896.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Poets have long described the mind-altering effects of a passionate relationship – “my love’s a noble madness” wrote John Dryden. “Of all the emotions,” said Cicero, “there is none more violent than love. Love is a madness.” Psychology research is beginning to back this up. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9380-3">recent study</a> found that students in the early days of a passionate relationship exhibited reduced cognitive control in basic psychological tests. Now brain researchers in Japan have started to look for the neural correlates of these effects. <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01763/full?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Psychology-w47-2016#B8">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, Hiroaki Kawamichi and his colleagues report the results of their brain imaging experiment showing that participants in the relatively early stages of a romantic relationship had reduced grey matter in a region of the brain involved in processing reward, which might suggest their brains had adjusted to the intensity of their love affair.</p>
<p><span id="more-15510"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited  56 young men and women who were currently in a romantic relationship of at least one month’s duration (the average length was 17 months), and for comparison they recruited 57 age-matched control participants who were not currently in a relationship. All the participants completed a happiness survey and also underwent a structural brain scan.</p>
<p>The participants in an early-stage romantic relationship were happier than those who were single. And looking across the entire brain, the researchers found one specific area – the right-dorsal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum">striatum</a> – that was structurally different in the in-love participants compared with the singletons, in terms of there being reduced grey matter density in the lovers. This region is found near the front of the brain, beneath the cortex and is involved in reward processing.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that the researchers found this brain difference but without any psychological testing, or functional or connectivity-based brain scanning – which could show how brain areas speak to each other and how they operate during different mental activities – it’s very difficult to interpret its meaning.</p>
<p>Another short-coming is that the scans were taken at just one point in time, so we’ve no way of knowing if being in love shrinks the right-dorsal striatum or if people with less grey matter in this area are more likely to fall in love (I’m also using terms like “in love” liberally because we don’t have any detail on the intensity of the participants’ romances). The only clue we have about cause and effect here is that, across all participants, the researchers found no link between striatal volume and total time in life spent in romantic relationships, suggesting a reversibility to any potential effects of romance on the brain.</p>
<p>Putting these important cautions to one side, it does seem plausible that enjoying a passionate romance could lead to grey matter reductions in the striatum, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911001911">just as has been found in cocaine users</a>, for example. This would make sense if you think of being in love as an intensely rewarding time, in which case the brain might “down-regulate” its reward sensitivity, adjusting to a world where there is joy to be found in each touch and embrace with, or even merely thoughts of, that special other. It might also explain why a split can be so painful – the brain spoilt by such constant reward, left craving and expectant for a comfort that’s no longer there.</p>

 Accumulating data suggest that metastatic dissemination often occurs early during tumour formation, but the mechanisms of early metastatic spread have not yet been addressed. Here, by studying metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer model, we show that progesterone-induced signalling triggers migration of cancer cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promotes proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by increased HER2 expression and tumour-cell density involving microRNA-mediated progesterone receptor downregulation, and was reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness features, migrated more and founded more metastases than cells from dense, advanced tumours. Notably, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived from early disseminated cancer cells. Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these findings for human metastatic dissemination.

 The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

            <p>
 Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths; metastatic lesions develop from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that can remain dormant. Metastasis-initiating cells are thought to originate from a subpopulation present in progressed, invasive tumours. However, DCCs detected in patients before the manifestation of breast-cancer metastasis contain fewer genetic abnormalities than primary tumours or than DCCs from patients with metastases. These findings, and those in pancreatic cancer and melanoma models, indicate that dissemination might occur during the early stages of tumour evolution. However, the mechanisms that might allow early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) to complete all steps of metastasis are unknown. Here we show that, in early lesions in mice and before any apparent primary tumour masses are detected, there is a sub-population of Her2+p-p38lop-Atf2loTwist1hiE-cadlo early cancer cells that is invasive and can spread to target organs. Intra-vital imaging and organoid studies of early lesions showed that Her2+ eDCC precursors invaded locally, intravasated and lodged in target organs. Her2+ eDCCs activated a Wnt-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dissemination program but without complete loss of the epithelial phenotype, which was reversed by Her2 or Wnt inhibition. Notably, although the majority of eDCCs were Twist1hiE-cadlo and dormant, they eventually initiated metastasis. Our work identifies a mechanism for early dissemination in which Her2 aberrantly activates a program similar to mammary ductal branching that generates eDCCs that are capable of forming metastasis after a dormancy phase.

 The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels.

 Seahorses have a specialized morphology that includes a toothless tubular mouth, a body covered with bony plates, a male brood pouch, and the absence of caudal and pelvic fins. Here we report the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome of the tiger tail seahorse, Hippocampus comes. Comparative genomic analysis identifies higher protein and nucleotide evolutionary rates in H. comes compared with other teleost fish genomes. We identified an astacin metalloprotease gene family that has undergone expansion and is highly expressed in the male brood pouch. We also find that the H. comes genome lacks enamel matrix protein-coding proline/glutamine-rich secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes, which might have led to the loss of mineralized teeth. tbx4, a regulator of hindlimb development, is also not found in H. comes genome. Knockout of tbx4 in zebrafish showed a ‘pelvic fin-loss’ phenotype similar to that of seahorses.

 The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential and resilience. Genetic modification is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops such as wheat. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop growth and development. Here we show that application of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed and constructed based on a ‘signalling-precursor’ concept for permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other organism function.

 The type III secretion (T3S) injectisome is a specialized protein nanomachine that is critical for the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, including purveyors of plague, typhoid fever, whooping cough, sexually transmitted infections and major nosocomial infections. This syringe-shaped 3.5-MDa macromolecular assembly spans both bacterial membranes and that of the infected host cell. The internal channel formed by the injectisome allows for the direct delivery of partially unfolded virulence effectors into the host cytoplasm. The structural foundation of the injectisome is the basal body, a molecular lock-nut structure composed predominantly of three proteins that form highly oligomerized concentric rings spanning the inner and outer membranes. Here we present the structure of the prototypical Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 1 basal body, determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, with the inner-membrane-ring and outer-membrane-ring oligomers defined at 4.3 Å and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. This work presents the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution structural characterization of the major components of the basal body in the assembled state, including that of the widespread class of outer-membrane portals known as secretins.

 Enzymes are ideal for use in asymmetric catalysis by the chemical industry, because their chemical compositions can be tailored to a specific substrate and selectivity pattern while providing efficiencies and selectivities that surpass those of classical synthetic methods. However, enzymes are limited to reactions that are found in nature and, as such, facilitate fewer types of transformation than do other forms of catalysis. Thus, a longstanding challenge in the field of biologically mediated catalysis has been to develop enzymes with new catalytic functions. Here we describe a method for achieving catalytic promiscuity that uses the photoexcited state of nicotinamide co-factors (molecules that assist enzyme-mediated catalysis). Under irradiation with visible light, the nicotinamide-dependent enzyme known as ketoreductase can be transformed from a carbonyl reductase into an initiator of radical species and a chiral source of hydrogen atoms. We demonstrate this new reactivity through a highly enantioselective radical dehalogenation of lactones—a challenging transformation for small-molecule catalysts. Mechanistic experiments support the theory that a radical species acts as an intermediate in this reaction, with NADH and NADPH (the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, respectively) serving as both a photoreductant and the source of hydrogen atoms. To our knowledge, this method represents the first example of photo-induced enzyme promiscuity, and highlights the potential for accessing new reactivity from existing enzymes simply by using the excited states of common biological co-factors. This represents a departure from existing light-driven biocatalytic techniques, which are typically explored in the context of co-factor regeneration.

            <p>A provocative new report suggests a low-cost, non-invasive testing protocol may identify older individuals at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators discovered testing individuals’ ability to recognize, remember and distinguish between odors provided similar recommendations as genetic, imaging, and more detailed memory tests.</p>
<p>The report — suggesting testing of both olfactory and cognitive abilities as a means to designate candidates for treatments designed to halt or slow Alzheimer’s symptom development — has been published online in Annals of Neurology.</p>
<p>Mark Albers, M.D., Ph.D., of the MGH Department of Neurology, the principal investigator and corresponding author of the report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is increasing evidence that the neurodegeneration behind Alzheimer’s disease starts at least 10 years before the onset of memory symptoms. The development of a digitally-enabled, affordable, accessible, and non-invasive means to identify healthy individuals who are at risk is a critical step to developing therapies that slow down or halt Alzheimer’s disease progression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is well-known that brain circuits that process olfactory information can be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, and several studies have documented a diminished ability to identify odors in affected individuals.</p>
<p>Other studies have associated deficits in odor identification with established Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and with greater rates of cognitive decline. However, the most commonly used test of olfactory ability — the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test — has a number of limitations and does not take into account the great variation in olfactory ability among healthy individuals.</p>
<p>In the research the MGH team used a battery of four tests to addresses both olfactory and cognitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the OPID (Odor Percept IDentification)-10 test, participants are presented with a battery of 10 odors — menthol, clove, leather, strawberry, lilac, pineapple, smoke, soap, grape, or lemon. After experiencing each odor for two seconds, they are asked whether the scent is familiar and then asked to choose among four words — from the names listed above — for the one that best describes the odor.</li>
<li>Participants then complete the Odor Awareness Scale (OAS), a previously validated questionnaire that assesses their overall attention to environmental odors and how they are affected emotionally and behaviorally by scents.</li>
<li>The OPID-20 test includes the 10 odors previously presented and an additional 10 — banana, garlic, cherry, baby powder, grass, fruit punch, peach, chocolate, dirt, and orange. Participants are first asked whether a presented odor was included in the OPID-10 test and then asked which word best describes the odor. Their ability to remember odors from the first test determines their POEM (Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory) score.</li>
<li>In the Odor Discrimination (OD) test, participants are presented with two consecutive odors and asked whether they were different or the same, a process that is repeated 12 times with different paired scents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study recruited 183 participants, most of whom were enrolled in ongoing studies at the MGH-based Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.</p>
<p>At the time of the olfactory testing, 70 were cognitively normal, 74 tested normal on cognitive tests but were personally concerned about their cognitive abilities, 29 had mild cognitive impairment, and 10 had been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>As part of the studies they were enrolled in, all of them had comprehensive medical and neurological examinations — including annual tests of their memory and cognitive abilities — and several had brain imaging studies of Alzheimer’s-associated factors.</p>
<p>Results of the OPID-20 test significantly differentiated among the four groups of participants, and those results correlated with the thinning of two brain regions — the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex — previously associated with Alzheimer’s risk.</p>
<p>Participants’ ability to remember a previously presented aroma, as reflected in the POEM score, also showed significant differences between the two cognitively normal groups and participants with Alzheimer’s disease, whose results were no better than chance.</p>
<p>Because the ability of normal individuals to recognize and discriminate between odors can vary by as much as 40 times, the POEM scores of the two cognitively normal groups were compared with what would have been predicted based on their ability to identify and differentiate between odors, as reflected in the OAS and OD tests.</p>
<p>That comparison determined whether each individual was a good or poor POEM performer, and poor POEM performers were more likely to have the variant of the APOE gene associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. While results of an annual test of short-term memory improved year-to-year for the good POEM performers, no such improvement was seen among the poor performers, who also showed thinning of the entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p>Albers and his colleagues are currently recruiting participants for a larger-scale study to validate these results:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is well recognized that early diagnosis and intervention are likely to produce the most effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease — preventing the onset or the progression of symptoms. If these results hold up, this sort of inexpensive, noninvasive screening could help us identify the best candidates for novel therapies to prevent the development of symptoms of this tragic disease.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In England there’s an independent health advisory body that provides guidelines to clinicians working in the NHS, to make sure that wherever patients are in the country, they receive the best possible evidence-backed care. <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) was set up in 1999 and many of its guidelines pertain to mental health, and they often promote psychological approaches – for example, the guidelines for depression state that talking therapies should be the first-line of treatment for all but the most severely affected patients. While clinical and counselling psychologists have been involved in producing these guidelines, many of their colleagues – especially those in practice – are highly critical of them. Why? A series of interviews with 11 clinical psychologists, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2054/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience">published in <em>Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy</em></a>, sheds new light on the scepticism and concern felt towards NICE guidelines, and why some psychologists are even deliberately ignoring them.</p>
<p><span id="more-15369"></span></p>
<p>Alex Court at the Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology interviewed 11 clinical psychologists “in routine practice in the NHS” for roughly an hour each. Court’s approach was open-ended and he began each interview by simply asking each psychologist to share their thoughts on the NICE guidelines. Court subsequently transcribed the interviews and together with his colleagues he set about looking for emerging themes in their answers. He kept a diary throughout, in part to reflect on how his own opinions might be influencing his interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>The psychologists valued the NICE guidelines for the way that they provide a useful roundup of the latest evidence relevant to a particular condition or social issue, and also for the fact they often promoted psychological approaches. However, many of the psychologists were also very concerned about the premise of the guidelines, especially their grounding in a medical perspective on psychological distress, and the implication that the evidence is “neat” and that there is a correct approach across the board. The psychologists felt this curtailed their freedom to use their judgment and tailor their approach to individual patients. In particular there was a feeling that the guidelines are biased toward Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), and that they could influence NHS commissioners and managers to favour cost-saving approaches, to the potential detriment of individual patients.</p>
<p>Given these concerns, some of the interviewees said they sometimes gave managers the impression that they were delivering NICE-approved treatments, even when they weren’t:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would probably say I’m doing CBT, even if I’m not doing, you know, even if it’s a bit fudgy around the edges,” said Jenny (the study doesn’t use the psychologists’ real names).</p>
<p>“I use approaches that aren’t in the NICE guidelines at all. Er I do what I see to be effective,” said Morgan.</p>
<p>“Well I, well I certainly wouldn’t advertise what I do to the managers,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“For me, they’re guidelines, rather than somebody telling me what to do,” said Kim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of what’s driving these psychologists’ concerns is that the influence of NICE guidelines has seen the emergence of single-approach therapists, such as CBT-therapists, who are cheaper for the NHS to employ but who arguably aren’t able to offer patients multifaceted, individually tailored care in the way that psychologists can:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… [A]s a clinical psychologist I will be bringing in lots of different therapy kind of techniques and models and formulations from different erm models of psychological therapies, so I don’t think it’s as purist as maybe NICE guidelines might encourage people to think,” said Amy.</p>
<p>“[Integration is] seen as weak or criticism, and actually I think that’s our biggest strength, and that’s what I mean by we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. As psychologists it would be nice if we actually worked to maintain our identity and what we have that’s special to offer,” said Jan .</p></blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on the interviews, Court and his colleagues said that there seemed to be a “perverse incentive” within the NHS for clinical psychologists “to claim to be doing protocol-driven, single-model therapy whilst actually conducting much more sophisticated interventions, drawing on a range of psychological theory and based on an individualised, formulation co-constructed with the service user.” The researchers also argued that their results highlight the need for NHS managers to allow clinical psychologists (and other skilled clinicians) flexibility in choosing the care they offer to service users, rather than being overly prescriptive. However, to play devil’s advocate, I would suggest the guidelines can help correct for <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/28/the-mistakes-that-lead-therapists-to-infer-psychotherapy-was-effective-when-it-wasnt/">the difficulty clinicians can have in judging whether their favoured approach is effective or not</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to know how representative these findings are of clinical psychologists more generally, and how much the research authors’ own feelings influenced the interviews and how they were interpreted. Court and his colleagues acknowledged the subjectivity in their research – “this study makes no claims that the findings are objective,” they wrote. It’s perhaps worth noting too that there was nothing random about the recruitment process – four of the interviewees were already known to Court (though they weren’t colleagues), and he chose others based on a pre-interview screening process to try to reflect a mix of opinions. Also, Court’s supervisor and co-author Anne Cook has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/17/were-not-surprised-half-our-psychologist-colleagues-are-depressed">written publicly</a> about the adverse effects of treatment time limits and targets on clinical psychologists, and it seems at least plausible that her own concerns about NICE guidelines may have influenced the tone of the paper.</p>
<p>That said, this research provides an important and rare insight into what some NHS clinical psychologists think of the official guidelines that are meant to be guiding how they work.</p>

            Retraction Watch reports on an initiative by the microbiology journal mSphere. Under the new system, the editors no longer take responsibility for inviting peer reviewers to evaluate each manuscript. Instead, the would-be authors are expected to find two reviewers themselves, and to submit the reviews along with their paper.

mSphere call this approach 'author-initiated peer review', but I like to think of it as the "Pick-Your-Own" system.



The new system, we're told, will make for a fas
