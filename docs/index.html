              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-stolen-fossil-big-head-walking-flying">This big-headed pterosaur may have preferred walking over flying</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2013, a police raid at Santos Harbor in Brazil recovered about 30,000 smuggled fossils, including the most intact specimen of a type of big-headed pterosaur ever found. A new analysis of the fossil provides <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254789">insight into the flying reptile’s foraging style, flight capability and anatomy</a>, researchers report August 25 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>Identified as <em>Tupandactylus navigans</em>, the fossil is a member of a group of pterosaurs called tapejarids. These pterosaurs are known for their oversize, crested skulls, and hail from the early Cretaceous Period, which lasted from about 145 million to 100 million years ago.</p>



<p>Some well-preserved tapejarid fossils have been found in China, but they aren’t as complete as the newly analyzed fossil, and the pterosaur’s anatomy hadn’t been fully described. “This is the first time we have the full skull and the full [body],” says Victor Beccari, a paleontologist at the NOVA School of Science &amp; Technology in Caparica, Portugal.</p>



<p>When Beccari’s team received the fossil in 2016, it had already been cut into six blocks. “It’s a shame,” Beccari says, “but we used it to our advantage.” The researchers fit the sliced pieces inside a CT scanner, and then used the scans to produce a 3-D model of the pterosaur’s skeleton that revealed parts still buried inside rock.</p>

Beccari</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previous studies suggested that tapejarids had a short, stout neck to support their large head during flight. But Beccari’s team showed that the neck accounted for over half of the spine’s length, which could have made sustained flight difficult. The fossil’s long hind legs and relatively short arms hint that tapejarids could have been comfortable walking.</p>



<p>These observations suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> may have behaved similarly to peacocks, Beccari says. The tapejarid’s crest probably attracted mates, and the pterosaur may have flown to treetops to look for food or escape from predators, he says. “But it spent most of its time walking on the ground.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-skeleton-woman-indonesia-peopling-southeast-asian-islands">Ancient DNA shows the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was surprisingly complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A young woman who lived on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi as early as around 7,300 years ago had a surprisingly ancient East Asian pedigree, mixed with a dash of Denisovan ancestry, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Researchers excavated the woman’s partial skeleton from South Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03823-6">analysis of her DNA</a> shows that she was a descendent of mainly East Asian <em>Homo sapiens</em> who probably reached the tropical outpost at least 50,000 years ago, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, many scientists thought that skilled mariners and farmers called Austronesians first spread East Asian genes through Wallacea, a group of islands between mainland Asia and Australia that includes Sulawesi, Lombok and Flores, around 3,500 years ago.</p>



<p>The ancient Sulawesi woman’s DNA “provides the first indication that an Asian ancestry was present in Wallacea long before the Austronesian expansion,” says archaeologist Adam Brumm of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.</p>



<p>Indonesian archaeologists who unearthed the skeleton — and who coauthored the new study with Brumm, population geneticist Selina Carlhoff of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and other colleagues — nicknamed the young woman, who was 17 or 18 years old when she died, Besse (pronounced BESS-eh). In ethnic communities of South Sulawesi, Besse is an affectionate term for individual girls and women.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="737" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg" alt="researchers working at Leang Panninge cave" class="wp-image-3102934" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-535x383.jpg 535w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-629x450.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-260x186.jpg 260w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-811x580.jpg 811w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102934">Researchers work at the entrance to Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. Ancient DNA was extracted from a hunter-gatherer’s skeleton excavated inside the cave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102934">Leang Panninge research team</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After arriving on Sulawesi, the woman’s ancestors mated with Denisovans who already inhabited the island, the investigators suspect. Known mainly from ancient DNA samples, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fossil-denisovan-skull-cave-siberia">Denisovans</a> are a group of mysterious ancient hominids who date to as early as around 300,000 years ago in Siberia and survived on nearby Papua New Guinea until as late as 30,000 to 15,000 years ago (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>The discovery of Besse shows that the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was much more complex than has typically been appreciated, says population geneticist Lluis Quintana-Murci of Collége de France and the Pasteur Institute, both in Paris. “Wallacea was probably a key habitat region for Denisovan-related groups,” adds Quintana-Murci, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>The researchers estimate that the ancient Sulawesi woman inherited about 2.2 percent of her DNA from Denisovans. That’s a bit less than some other groups in the region. Indigenous groups in the Philippines carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">the highest known levels of Denisovan ancestry, topping out at about 5 percent</a> (<em>SN: 8/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Earlier genetic evidence suggested that different Denisovan populations interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> groups in the Philippines and on a land mass that included what’s now Papua New Guinea and Australia. The Sulawesi woman’s DNA indicates that interbreeding occurred in Wallacea as some Stone Age <em>H. sapiens</em> made their way toward Papua New Guinea and Australia. “The major gene flow from Denisovans into ancestors of Papuans and Aboriginal Australians most likely took place once [<em>H. sapiens</em>] reached the Wallacea islands,” says population geneticist and study coauthor Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>





<p>The woman’s DNA more closely resembles that of present-day Papuans and Indigenous Australians than of any current mainland East Asians, the scientists say. Those comparisons indicate that she belonged to a previously unknown, distinct genetic line of humans that emerged around 37,000 years ago, roughly the same time as a previously estimated evolutionary split of Papuans from Indigenous Australians. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Carefully crafted stone points that had been placed in the ancient woman’s grave identify her as a member of South Sulawesi’s Toalean hunter-gatherer people, Brumm says. Toalean stone artifacts date to between roughly 8,000 and 1,500 years ago. Evidence of Toalean culture disappears after that.</p>



<p>The Indonesian coauthors of the new study excavated the ancient woman’s partial skeleton from 2015 to 2019. Surviving fossils mainly came from the skull and pelvis. DNA was extracted from a dense bone in the base of the skull that’s known to preserve genetic material especially well. Fossils in tropical climates like Indonesia’s rarely yield ancient DNA because the fragile genetic material doesn’t typically survive those conditions.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of a burned seed from a common Southeast Asian tree, which was found near the skeleton, provided an age estimate of between around 7,300 and 7,200 years.</p>



<p>It’s not known if ancestors of Besse created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-cave-painting-art-pig-found-indonesia">previously discovered Sulawesi rock art of a pig that dates to at least 45,500 years ago</a>, one of the oldest known artistic depictions of a real-world organism (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). So the artists of that work remain a mystery, for now.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Imposter syndrome — the feeling that you don&#8217;t belong or aren&#8217;t capable at work or in education — can affect anybody. But people from underrepresented backgrounds are more likely to experience imposter syndrome: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">first generation university students</a>, for example, or <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-09930-002">people of colour</a>.</p>



<p>Imposter syndrome can be particularly acute in academia, where intellectual flair is prized. In fact, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-70498-001">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Educational Psychology</em> finds that in fields in which intellectual “brilliance” is perceived to be a prerequisite to success, imposter syndrome is more likely to strike women and early-career academics.</p>

<p>Participants were 4,870 academics from nine universities in the United States, all of which had a medical school, were research intensive, and were ranked in the country’s top 100 institutions. After noting down their field of research, participants completed a measure of imposter feelings, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am afraid people important to me may find out that I am not as capable as they think I am”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, they filled in measures of belonging (how accepted they felt by others in their field) and self-efficacy (how confident they were in their ability to succeed). Finally, participants indicated to what extent they felt brilliance was required for success in their field, again indicating agreement or disagreement with statements such as “being a top scholar of [my discipline] requires a special aptitude that just can’t be taught” and “I think that with the right amount of effort and dedication, anyone can be a top scholar of [my discipline]”.</p>



<p>Overall, women reported more imposter feelings than men. And women reported greater feelings of being an imposter the more that they believed their field was oriented towards natural brilliance rather than hard work. Those early on in their careers also reported more imposter feelings than those on faculty or in more secure positions, and again reported greater imposter feelings the more that they felt their field required natural brillance. People who reported more imposter feelings were also likely to rate themselves as lower in self-efficacy and lower in feelings of belonging to their wider field.</p>



<p>The gender differences were even starker when the team looked at the ethnic background of academics, too: compared to White or Asian women, women from underrepresented minority backgrounds experienced even greater levels of imposter syndrome in fields perceived as emphasising brilliance. So although the results were only correlational, the more a field was perceived to have an emphasis on or need for raw brilliance or genius, the more certain groups — women, people from ethnic groups underrepresented in academia, and early-career academics — were likely to experience imposter feelings and a lack of belonging.</p>



<p>Beyond the potential distress or stress that imposter feelings can cause, there could also be other ramifications. Low levels of self-efficacy and belonging are likely to impact not only productivity but likelihood of continuing in the field. Indeed, the team notes that the lower level of&nbsp; imposter feelings among established academics could be down to a survivorship bias: those who never feel like they don’t belong are more likely to pursue a further career in academia than those who feel a lack of community or lack of ability. A longitudinal study could explore this further. If those who feel a lack of belonging are also more likely to belong to underrepresented groups, this could also hinder efforts to make particular fields more diverse.</p>



<p>It could also be that we need to reframe how we think about imposter syndrome altogether. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.1924137">Other research</a>, for example, has suggested that &#8220;imposterism&#8221; is a bad lens through which to view the struggles Black doctoral students face in racist environments. Rather than framing imposter feelings as an internal phenomenon, it may be more helpful to think about those barriers that stand in the way of certain people feeling comfortable and successful in their fields – and to try to break those barriers down.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-70498-001">Women—particularly underrepresented minority women—and early-career academics feel like impostors in fields that value brilliance.</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">Racism lurks in names given to plants and animals. That’s starting to change</a></h4>

              
                <p>With lemon and black plumage, the Scott’s oriole flashes in the desert like a flame. But the bird’s name holds a violent history that Stephen Hampton can’t forget. He used to see the orioles often, living in California. Now that he lives outside the bird’s range, “I’m kind of relieved,” he says.</p>



<p>Hampton is a birder and registered citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Winfield Scott, a U.S. military commander and the bird’s namesake, drove Hampton’s ancestors and other Native Americans from their land in the 1800s during a series of forced marches now known as the Trail of Tears. The journey killed over 4,000 Cherokee, displacing <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/482714?refreqid=excelsior%3Af88ed89a5d19437b33a44e3a3f1c42c0">as many as 100,000</a> people in the end.</p>



<p>“So much of the Trail of Tears is already erased,” Hampton says. “There’s a few historical sites, but you’d have to be an archaeologist to figure out where the actual stockades were.” Linking Scott’s legacy to a bird “is just adding to the erasure by putting another layer over it.” </p>



<p>The oriole is just one of dozens of species that scientists are considering renaming because of racist or other offensive connotations. In a groundswell of revision, scientists are wrestling with this heritage. </p>





<p>Racist relics can infuse both scientific and common names. But in contrast to scientific names — which are internationally standardized in Latin — common names live in the vernacular. They vary by language and region, and have a smaller scope than scientific names’ international reach, making them arguably simpler to change. Some get immortalized in field guides and formally recognized by scientific societies. These common names provide a useful shared language for scientists and the public, but they can also enshrine harmful legacies. Advocates for change see some names as barriers to inclusion and distractions from the organisms themselves. But those advocates also see opportunities in renaming.</p>



<p>“We can choose language that reflects our shared values,” says Jessica Ware, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and president-elect of the Entomological Society of America, or ESA. Name changes themselves are nothing new; scientific and common names both shift as scientists learn more about a species. The ESA keeps a list of English common names for insects, updated annually.</p>



<p>In July, the ESA removed the pejorative term “gypsy,” what many consider to be a slur for Romani people, from its common name list for two insects, the moth <em>Lymantria dispar</em> and the ant <em>Aphaenogaster araneoides</em>. The ESA has invited new name suggestions from the public. In the meantime, the insects will go by their internationally recognized scientific names.</p>

In July, the society retired the name “gypsy moth,” which contained a pejorative for Romani people.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102829">Heather Broccard-Bell/E+/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;This is a moral, necessary and long-overdue change,” says Margareta Matache, a Roma rights activist and scholar at Harvard University. It’s a “small yet historic” step to rectify portrayals where “Roma have been denied humanity or depicted as less than human,” she says.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">Better Common Names Project</a>, the ESA now prohibits names perpetuating negative stereotypes, and welcomes public input about which names to change next. So far, over 80 insensitive names have been identified, and over 100 name ideas for <em>L. dispar</em> have streamed in, Ware says. With a “bottom-up swelling of names” to choose from, “everybody is included,” she says.</p>



<p>But racist legacies lurk in lingo.<strong> </strong>Some scorpions, birds, fishes and flowers are known by the label Hottentot, a term of abuse for Indigenous Khoikhoi people in southern Africa. The Digger pine tree bears a pejorative for the Paiute people in the western United States, once derisively called diggers by white settlers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Changing offensive common names of species is nothing new</h3>



<p>It’s not unusual for common names, or even Latin names, of species to change. Sometimes new information about a species prompts a name change, but as the following examples show, names deemed offensive have been revised for at least two decades.</p>



<p><strong>Pikeminnow</strong> (<em>Ptychocheilus</em>): Four pikeminnow fish species were once called “squawfish,” using an offensive term for Native American women. In 1998, the American Fisheries Society changed the name, as an “exceptional” example of a violation of “good taste.”</p>



<p><strong>Long-tailed duck</strong> (<em>Clangula hyemalis</em>): In 2000, the American Ornithological Society renamed the derogatory “Oldsquaw” duck after urging from Indigenous communities — but not officially because the name was offensive. “Long-tailed duck” was already used in Europe, so the reasoning of maintaining consistency was accepted.</p>



<p><strong>Goliath grouper</strong> (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>): This 800-pound fish was formerly known as the “jewfish.” The American Fisheries Society changed the name in 2001, after a petition citing the name’s offensiveness.</p>
</div>



<p>The bird world, in particular, has been reckoning with such legacies. Birds named for people proliferated in 19th century ornithology, glorifying the namers themselves or figures they favored. Today, 142 North American bird names endure as verbal monuments to people. Some names — such as Scott’s oriole, chosen by naturalist and U.S. military officer Darius Nash Couch — lionize people who participated in genocide. Others — such as Bachman’s sparrow, named after Lutheran minister and naturalist John Bachman — venerate people who defended slavery. “Blacks and Native Americans would have always been opposed to these names,” Hampton says.</p>



<p>Since 2020, supporters of the grassroots campaign <a href="https://birdnamesforbirds.wordpress.com/">Bird Names for Birds</a> have advocated for a solution — replace all eponymous bird names with descriptive ones. “It&#8217;s not a be-all-end-all solution” to removing barriers to birding for minority communities, says Robert Driver, an evolutionary biologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C. But it’s one gesture of “consideration for everyone who&#8217;s out there with binoculars.”</p>



<p>The American Ornithological Society initially rejected Driver’s proposal to revise the name of a brownish-gray bird called McCown’s longspur, named after Confederate general John P. McCown. But after the 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide reflection on systemic racism and as some Confederate monuments were removed and sports teams with offensive epithets were renamed, the ornithology society changed its policies to consider a namesake’s role in “reprehensible events” as grounds for revision. Now, the bird is known as the thick-billed longspur. <strong></strong></p>



<p>Driver wants Scott’s oriole to be next — but for now, English bird name changes have paused while a committee with the society <a href="https://americanornithology.org/english-bird-names/whats-next-for-english-bird-names/">recommends a new name-changing process</a>. “We are committed to changing these harmful and exclusionary names,” says Mike Webster, an ornithologist at Cornell University and president of the society.</p>



<p>Removing harmful terms offers long-term stability in common names, Ware says. With thoughtful criteria, scientists and others can craft names built to last. “So it might be uncomfortable now,” Ware says. “But hopefully, that only happens once.”</p>



<p>As for Hampton, he doesn’t see Scott’s oriole anymore, now that he lives in Washington State. But he still can’t escape these types of names. Sometimes while birding, he spies Townsend’s solitaire — a bird that favors juniper berries. It’s named after American naturalist John Kirk Townsend, who collected Indigenous people’s skulls in the 1830s for cranial measurements that were used to justify pseudoscientific racial hierarchies. “Every time I see one [of the birds], I&#8217;m thinking, ‘That should be juniper solitaire,’” Hampton says. In his mind’s eye, Scott’s oriole is the yucca oriole. “I can&#8217;t wait for those to be changed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-toad-pupil-eye-seven-different-shapes">Frog and toad pupils mainly come in seven different shapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frog and toad pupils come in quite the array, from slits to circles. But overall, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1402">there are seven main shapes of these animals’ peepholes</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 25 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Eyes are “among the most charismatic features of frogs and toads,” says herpetologist Julián Faivovich of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales “Bernardino Rivadavia” in Buenos Aires. People have long marveled at the animals’ many iris colors and pupil shapes. Yet “there’s almost nothing known about the anatomical basis of that diversity.”</p>



<p>Faivovich and colleagues catalogued pupil shapes from photos of 3,261 species, representing 44 percent of known frogs and toads. The team identified seven main shapes: vertical slits, horizontal slits, diamonds, circles, triangles, fans and inverted fans. The most common shape, horizontal slits, appeared in 78 percent of studied species.</p>



<p>Mapping pupil shapes onto a tree of evolutionary relationships allowed the scientists to infer how these seven shapes emerged. Though uncommon in other vertebrates, horizontal pupils seem to have given rise to most of the other shapes in frogs and toads. All together, these seven shapes have evolved at least 116 times, the researchers say.</p>

Cervino <em>et al</em>/<em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pupil shape affects the amount of light that reaches the retina and its light-receiving cells, says Nadia Cervino, a herpetologist also at the Argentine museum. But how the shape influences what animals actually see isn’t well-known.</p>



<p>Pupil shapes generally didn’t correspond with animals’ lifestyles and habitats. The scientists plan to continue investigating what drives pupil evolution in tree frogs, a smaller group with fewer types of pupil shapes. And the team will consider other lifestyle factors, including how high frogs climb or whether they lay eggs in water, as well as other eye characteristics, such as iris color, to see if those factors matter to pupil shape.</p>



<p>With a biodiversity crisis caused by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll">a skin fungus</a> that has led to many presumed extinctions of frogs and toads worldwide, researchers may be losing clues to this mystery (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/28/19</em>). “When we are losing species,” Faivovich says, “we’re actually losing the opportunity of learning a lot about them.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Obtaining a solid measurement of creativity can be hugely time consuming. Well-established tests — such as the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), which asks participants to generate unusual ways to use common objects — require substantial time and effort in order to properly score participant responses. Not only that, but assessment of the creativity of responses varies wildly as a result of both the scorers’ judgements and the qualities of answers relative to the rest of the data. For example, one especially creative response amongst a sea of generic responses may garner extra points; place that same answer amongst other highly creative responses, however, and it is likely to score lower.</p>



<p>But take heart, overstretched researchers — a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/25/e2022340118">new paper</a> in <em>PNAS</em> suggests there may be an easier, more reliable way to measure creativity.</p>



<p>In an effort to combat these issues, researchers led by Jay A. Olson from Harvard University have attempted to streamline the process by devising a new task which can be easily analysed by a computer algorithm.</p>



<p>Their research suggests that the newly created measure — the Divergent Association Task (DAT) — may be at least as effective at measuring verbal creativity as other, more widely known creativity measures, with the added bonuses of being both shorter and more enjoyable to participants.</p>



<span id="more-43340"></span>



<p>The DAT relies on the concept of <em>semantic distance</em>, which is a measure of how related two words are to each other. Traditional approaches to measuring creativity require participants to give long, prose-like answers, and algorithms struggle to analyse semantic distance in these tasks. This is because the exact meaning of words often hinges on nuance, sentence structure, and context. For instance, the authors write, in the Alternative Uses Task someone might say that they use a pen to “record a break” or to “break a record”. The latter is clearly more creative, but a programme looking at semantic distance wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.</p>



<p>However, by using single words as opposed to prose, the DAT effectively circumnavigates these issues by breaking responses down into components that can be easily analysed by a computer. During the task, participants are asked to produce 10 nouns as unrelated to each other as possible over the span of four minutes, generating a small pool of words for analysis. The semantic distance between the first seven valid words provided is then computed using an algorithm called GIoVe, which has been trained on text from billions of web pages.</p>



<p>The team conducted two studies comparing the DAT to established measures of creativity. The first study, conducted on a total of 476 predominantly female undergraduate students from Australia and Canada, demonstrated that the new measure correlated well with two components of the AUT’s creativity measure — flexibility and originality — though not the third component, fluency. There was also a strong positive correlation between DAT scores and scores on the Bridge-The-Associative-Gap task, in which participants are presented with two words (eg. giraffe, scarf) and are asked to provide the word that links them (eg. neck).</p>



<p>In the pre-registered second study, a more generalisable selection of 8,572 participants from 98 countries performed a shortened version of the AUT and the DAT. While the shortened AUT meant fluency and flexibility couldn’t be measured, the AUT and DAT scores did correlate positively on the dimension of originality. Participants also completed four problems probing insight, creativity, and analytical ability; higher scores in these tasks also positively correlated with DAT scores.</p>



<p>Not only does this new approach cut out much of the human effort and variability involved in judging scores, it also provides distinct advantages in certain research contexts. In the case of fMRI studies, for example, providing a handful of one-word answers is preferable to whole sentences, as it reduces the amount of participant movement. Researchers interested in simple creativity tasks for participants to complete under the influence of drugs such as psychedelics may also find the method particularly appealing.</p>



<p>As with most measurements, this new test does have some limitations. The authors highlight that several strategies can be employed to boost scores. For instance, participants might use items in the room to help them come up with new ideas, or intentionally reach for rarely used words which the algorithm may read as more semantically remote. It’s possible that this could lead the algorithm to inadvertently rating participants with higher education levels or more diverse vocabularies as more “creative”. It’s also unclear what influence multilingualism may have on DAT scores, though all of these factors are the subject of ongoing investigations by the team. In future, the analysis algorithm could be trained to process responses from more languages, time periods, and cultures to further improve the method’s precision.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541673595">Flashes of Creation</a><br><em>Paul Halpern</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>The Big Bang wasn’t always a sure bet. For several decades in the 20th century, researchers wrestled with interpreting cosmic origins, or if there even was a beginning at all. At the forefront of that debate stood physicists George Gamow and Fred Hoyle: One advocated for an expanding universe that sprouted from a hot, dense state; the other for a cosmos that is eternal and unchanging. Both pioneered contemporary cosmology, laid the groundwork for our understanding of where atoms come from and brought science to the masses.</p>



<p>In <em>Flashes of Creation</em>, physicist Paul Halpern recounts Gamow’s and Hoyle’s interwoven stories. The book bills itself as a “joint biography,” but that is a disservice. While Gamow and Hoyle are the central characters, the book is a meticulously researched history of the Big Bang as an idea: from theoretical predictions in the 1920s, to the discovery of its microwave afterglow in 1964, and beyond to the realization in the late 1990s that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.</p>





<p>Although the development of cosmology was the work of far more than just two scientists, Halpern would be hard-pressed to pick two better mascots. George Gamow was an aficionado of puns and pranks and had a keen sense of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/george-gamow-physicist-science-popularizer">how to explain science with charm and whimsy</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/18</em>). The fiercely stubborn Fred Hoyle had a darker, more cynical wit, with an artistic side that showed through in science fiction novels and even the libretto of an opera. Both wrote popular science books — Gamow’s <em>Mr Tompkins</em> series, which explores modern physics through the titular character’s dreams, are a milestone of the genre — and took to the airwaves to broadcast the latest scientific thinking into people’s homes.</p>





<p>“Gamow and Hoyle were adventurous loners who cared far more about cosmic mysteries than social conventions,” Halpern writes. “Each, in his own way, was a polymath, a rebel, and a master of science communication.”</p>



<p>While the Big Bang is now entrenched in the modern zeitgeist, it wasn’t always so. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">idea can be traced to Georges Lemaître</a>, a physicist and priest who proposed in 1927 that the universe is expanding. A few years later, he suggested that perhaps the cosmos began with all of its matter in a single point — the “primeval atom,” he called it. In the 1940s, Gamow latched on to the idea as way to explain how all the atomic elements came to be, forged in the “fireball” that would have filled the cosmos in its earliest moments. Hoyle balked at the notion of a moment of creation, convinced that the universe has always existed — and always will exist — in pretty much the same state we find it today. He even coined the term “Big Bang” as a put-down during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast. The elements, Hoyle argued, were forged in stars.</p>



<p>As far as the elements go, both were right. “One wrote the beginning of the story of element creation,” Halpern writes, “and the other wrote the ending.” We now know that hydrogen and helium nuclei emerged in overwhelming abundance during the first few minutes following the Big Bang. Stars took care of the rest.</p>



<p>Halpern treats Gamow and Hoyle with reverence and compassion. Re-created scenes provide insight into how both approached science and life. We learn how Gamow, ever the scientist, roped in physicist Niels Bohr to test ideas about why movie heroes always drew their gun faster than villains — a test that involved staging a mock attack with toy pistols. We sit in with Hoyle and colleagues while they discuss a horror film, <em>Dead of Night</em>, whose circular timeline inspired their ideas about an eternal universe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="408" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_reviews_flashes-of-creation_inline_gamow-hoyle.jpg" alt="black and white images of George Gamow and Fred Hoyle" class="wp-image-3102788" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_reviews_flashes-of-creation_inline_gamow-hoyle.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_reviews_flashes-of-creation_inline_gamow-hoyle-638x383.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_reviews_flashes-of-creation_inline_gamow-hoyle-310x186.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102788">In the mid-20th century, two astronomers emerged as spokesmen for dueling ideas about the origin of the cosmos.

<p>And Halpern doesn’t shy away from darker moments, inviting readers to know these scientists as flawed human beings. Gamow’s devil-may-care attitude wore on his colleagues, and his excessive drinking took its toll. Hoyle, in his waning decades, embraced outlandish ideas, suggesting that epidemics come from space and that a dinosaur fossil had been tampered with to show an evolutionary link to birds. And he went to his grave in 2001 still railing against the Big Bang.</p>



<p>Capturing the history of the Big Bang theory is no easy task, but Halpern pulls it off. The biggest mark against the book, in fact, may be its scope. To pull in all the other characters and side plots that drove 20th century cosmology, Gamow and Hoyle sometimes get forgotten about for long stretches. A bit more editing could have sharpened the book’s focus.</p>



<p>But to anyone interested in how the idea of the Big Bang grew — or how any scientific paradigm changes — <em>Flashes of Creation</em> is a treat and a worthy tribute to two scientific mavericks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">The definition of planet is still a sore point – especially among Pluto fans</a></h4>

              
                <p>For 76 years, Pluto was the beloved ninth planet. No one cared that it was the runt of the solar system, with a moon, Charon, half its size. No one minded that it had a tilted, eccentric orbit. Pluto was a weirdo, but it was our weirdo.</p>



<p>“Children identify with its smallness,” wrote science writer Dava Sobel in her 2005 book <em>The Planets</em>. “Adults relate to its inadequacy, its marginal existence as a misfit.”</p>



<p>When Pluto was excluded from the planetary display in 2000 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, children sent hate mail to Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the museum’s planetarium. Likewise, there was a popular uproar when 15 years ago, in August 2006, the International Astronomical Union, or IAU, wrote a new definition of “planet” that left Pluto out. The new definition required that a body 1) orbit the sun, 2) have enough mass to be spherical (or close) and 3) have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other bodies. Objects that meet the first two criteria but not the third, like Pluto, were designated “dwarf planets.”</p>



<p>Science is not sentimental. It doesn’t care what you’re fond of, or what mnemonic you learned in elementary school. Science appeared to have won the day. Scientists learned more about the solar system and revised their views accordingly.</p>





<p>“I believe that the decision taken was the correct one,” says astronomer Catherine Cesarsky of CEA Saclay in France, who was president of the IAU in 2006. “Pluto is very different from the eight solar system planets, and it would have been very difficult to keep changing the number of solar system planets as more massive [objects beyond Neptune] were being discovered. The intention was not at all to demote Pluto, but on the contrary to promote it as [a] prototype of a new class of solar system objects, of great importance and interest.”</p>





<p>For a long time, I shared this view. I’ve been writing about Pluto since my very first newspaper gig at the <em>Cornell Daily Sun</em>, when I was a junior in college in 2006. I interviewed some of my professors about the IAU’s decision. One, planetary scientist Jean-Luc Margot, who is now at UCLA, called it “a triumph of science over emotion. Science is all about recognizing that earlier ideas may have been wrong,” he said at the time. “Pluto is finally where it belongs.”</p>



<p>But another, planetary scientist Jim Bell, now at Arizona State University in Tempe, thought the decision was a travesty. He still does. The idea that planets have to clear their orbits is particularly irksome, he says. The ability to collect or cast out all that debris doesn’t just depend on the body itself.</p>



<p>Everything with interesting geology should be a planet, Bell told me recently. “I’m a lumper, not a splitter,” he says. “It doesn’t matter where you are, it matters what you are.”</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with him. “Fifteen years ago we finally got it right,” says planetary scientist Mike Brown of Caltech, who uses the Twitter handle @plutokiller because his research helped knock Pluto out of the planetary pantheon. “Pluto had been wrong all along.”</p>



<p>But since 2006, we’ve learned that Pluto has an atmosphere and maybe even clouds. It has mountains made of water ice, fields of frozen nitrogen, methane snow–capped peaks, and dunes and volcanoes. “It’s a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-pluto-unveiled-world-no-other">dynamic, complex world unlike any other orbiting the sun</a>,” journalist Christopher Crockett wrote in <em>Science News </em>in 2015 when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto.</p>

<p>The New Horizons mission showed that Pluto has fascinating and active geology to rival that of any rocky world in the inner solar system. And that solidified planetary scientist Philip Metzger’s view that the IAU definition missed the mark.</p>



<p>“There was an immediate reaction against the dumb definition” when it was proposed, says Metzger, of the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Since then, he and colleagues have been refining their views: “Why do we have this intuition that says that it’s dumb?”</p>



<h4>Retelling the tale</h4>



<p>It turns out that the “we just learned more” narrative isn’t really true, Metzger says. Though the official story is that Pluto was reclassified because new data came in, it’s not that simple. Teaching that narrative is bad for science, and for science education, he says.</p>



<p>The truth is, there’s no single definition of a planet — and I’m beginning to believe that’s a good thing.</p>



<p>For centuries, the word “planet” was a much more inclusive term. When Galileo turned his telescope at Jupiter, any largish moving body in the sky was considered a planet — including moons. When astronomers discovered the rocky bodies we now call asteroids in the 1800s, those too were called planets, at least at first.</p>



<p>Pluto was considered a planet from the very beginning. When Clyde Tombaugh, an amateur astronomer from Kansas newly recruited to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., spotted it in photos taken in January 1930, he rushed to the observatory director and declared: “I have found your Planet X.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh.jpg" alt="Clyde Tombaugh standing outside next to his telescope" class="wp-image-3102815" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-383x383.jpg 383w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-580x580.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-214x214.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102815">Clyde Tombaugh, shown here with a homemade telescope, discovered Pluto in 1930 when he was 24 years old.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102815">GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The discovery was no accident. In 1903, U.S. astronomer Percival Lowell hypothesized that a hidden planet seven times the mass of Earth orbited 45 times farther from the sun. Lowell had searched for what he called Planet X until he died in 1916. The search continued without him.</p>



<p>The new planet was thought to be “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/black-coal-dense-zinc">black as coal</a>, nearly as dense as iron, twice as dense as the heaviest earthly surface rocks,” <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, reported in 1930.</p>



<p>Further research showed Lowell had grossly overestimated Pluto’s mass: It’s more like one five-hundredth the mass of Earth. Things got even weirder when scientists realized <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/distant-object-hints-kuiper-belt">Pluto wasn’t alone out there</a>. In 1992, an object about a tenth the diameter of Pluto was found orbiting the sun “in the deep freeze of space well beyond the orbits of Pluto and Neptune,” as <em>Science News </em>described it.</p>



<p>Since then, more than 2,000 icy bodies have been found hiding in that frigid zone dubbed the Kuiper Belt, and there are many more out there. Awareness of Pluto’s neighbors brought new questions: What characteristics could unite these strange new worlds with the more familiar ones? And what sets them apart? With so many new objects coming into focus, there was a growing desire for a formal definition of “planet.”</p>



<p>In 2005, Brown spotted the first of the Kuiper Belt bodies that seemed to be larger than Pluto. If Pluto was the ninth planet, then surely the new discovery, nicknamed Xena (in honor of the TV show <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em>), should be the 10th. But if Xena was an icy leftover from the formation of the solar system undeserving of the “planet” title, so too was Pluto.</p>



<p>Tensions over how to categorize Pluto and Xena came to a head in 2006 at a meeting in Prague of the IAU. On the final day, August 24, after much acrimonious debate, a new definition of “planet” was put to a vote. Pluto and Xena got the boot. Xena was aptly renamed Eris, the Greek goddess of discord.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="429" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_vote.jpg" alt="members of the International Astronomical Union hold up yellow cards to vote in an auditorium" class="wp-image-3102817" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_vote.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_vote-607x383.jpg 607w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_vote-295x186.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102817">On August 24, 2006, in Prague, members of the International Astronomical Union voted for a new definition of planet that redesignated Pluto and its neighbor Eris as dwarf planets, shrinking the total number of planets in the solar system to eight.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102817">Michal Cizek/AFP/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Textbooks were revised, posters were reprinted, but many planetary scientists, especially those who study Pluto, never bothered to change. “Planetary scientists don’t use the IAU’s definition in publishing papers,” Metzger says. “We pretty much just ignore it.”</p>



<p>In part that might be cheek, or spite. But Metzger and colleagues think there’s good reason to reject the definition. Metzger, Bell and others — including Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute, the planetary scientist who led the New Horizons mission and has argued since before the discovery of the Kuiper Belt that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/plutos-galore">the solar system contains hundreds of “planets”</a> — make their case in a pair of recent papers, one <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103518303063?via%3Dihub">published in 2019 in <em>Icarus</em></a> and one forthcoming.</p>



<p>After examining hundreds of scientific papers, textbooks and letters dating back centuries, the researchers show that the way scientists and the public have used the word “planet” has changed over time, but not in the way most people think.</p>



<h4>In and out</h4>



<p>Consider Ceres, the first of what are now known as dwarf planets to be discovered. Located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres was considered a planet after its 1801 discovery, too. It’s often said that Ceres was demoted after astronomers found the rest of the bodies in the asteroid belt. By the end of the 1800s, with hundreds of asteroids piling up, Ceres was stripped of its planetary title thanks to its neighbors. In that sense, the story goes, Ceres and Pluto suffered the same fate.</p>



<p>But that’s not the real story, Metzger and colleagues found. Ceres and other asteroids were considered planets, sometimes dubbed “minor planets,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/small-fry-solar-system">well into the 20th century</a>. A 1951 article in <em>Science News Letter </em>declared that “thousands of planets are known to circle our sun,” although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/small-fry-solar-system">most are “small fry.</a>” These “baby planets” can be as small as a city block or as wide as Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 1960s, when spacecraft offered better observations of these bodies, that the term “minor planets” fell out of fashion. While the largest asteroids still looked planetlike, most small asteroids turned out to be lumpy and irregular in shape, suggesting a different origin or different geophysics than bigger, rounder planets. The fact that asteroids didn’t “clear their orbits” had nothing to do with the name change, Metzger argues.</p>



<p>And what about moons? Scientists called them “planets” or “secondary planets” until the 1920s. Surprisingly, it was nonscientific publications, notably astrological almanacs that used the positions of celestial bodies for horoscope readings, that insisted on the simplicity of a limited number of planets moving through the fixed sphere of stars.</p>



<p>Metzger thinks that older definition of a planet that included moons was forgotten when planetary science went through a “Great Depression” between about 1910 and 1950. So many asteroids had been discovered that searching for new ones or refining their orbits was getting boring. Telescopes weren’t good enough to start exploring asteroids’ geology yet. Other parts of space science were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">way more exciting</a>, so attention went there.</p>



<p>But new data that came with space travel brought moons back into the planetary fold. Starting in the 1960s, “planet” reappeared in the scientific literature as a description for satellites, at least the large, round ones.</p>



<h4>Real-world usage</h4>



<p>The planet definition that includes certain moons, asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects has had staying power because it’s useful, Metzger says. Planetary scientists’ work includes comparing a place like Mars (a planet) to Titan (a moon) to Triton (a moon that was probably born in the Kuiper Belt and captured by Neptune long ago) to Pluto (a dwarf planet). It’s scientifically useful to have a word to describe the cosmic bodies where interesting geophysics, including the conditions that enable life, occur, he says. There’s all sorts of extra complexity, from mountains to atmospheres to oceans and rivers, when rocky worlds grow big enough for their own gravity to make them spherical.</p>

<p>“We’re not claiming that we have the perfect definition of a planet and that all scientists ought to adopt our definition,” he adds. That’s the same mistake the IAU made. “We’re saying this is something that ought to be debated.”</p>



<p>A more inclusive definition of “planet” would also give a more accurate concept of what the solar system is. Emphasizing the eight major planets suggests that they dominate the solar system, when in fact the smaller stuff outnumbers those worlds tremendously. The major planets don’t even stay put in their orbits over long time-scales. The gas giants have shuffled around in the past. Teaching the view of the solar system that includes just eight static planets doesn’t do that dynamism justice.</p>



<p>Caltech’s Brown disagrees. Having the gravitational oomph to nudge other bodies in and out of line is an important feature of a world, he says. Plus, the eight planets clearly dominate our solar system, he says. “If you dropped me in the solar system for the first time, and I looked around and saw what was there, nobody would say anything other than, ‘Wow, there are these eight — choose your word — and a lot of other little things.’ ”</p>

<p>Thinking of planets that way leads to big-picture questions about how the solar system put itself together.</p>



<p>One common argument in favor of the IAU’s definition is that it keeps the number of planets manageable. Can you imagine if there were hundreds or thousands of planets? How would the average person keep track of them all? What would we print on lunch boxes? I’m not making fun of this idea; as an astronomy writer who has been obsessed with space since I was 8, I would be reluctant to turn people off to the planets.</p>



<p>But Metzger thinks teaching just eight planets risks turning people off to all the rest of space. “Back in the early 2000s, there was a lot of excitement when astronomers were discovering new planets in our solar system,” he says. “All that excitement ended in 2006.” But those objects are still out there and are still worthy of interest. By now, there are at least 150 of these dwarf planets, and most people have no clue, he says.</p>



<p>This is the argument I find most compelling. Why do we need to limit the number of planets? Kids can memorize the names and characteristics of hundreds of dinosaurs, or Pokémon, for that matter. Why not encourage that for planets? Why not inspire students to rediscover and explore the space objects that most appeal to them?</p>



<p>I’ve come to think that what makes a planet may just be in the eye of the beholders. I may be a lumper, not a splitter, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/663672798/0/oupblogpsychology/">What does the history of Victory Day tell us about Russia’s national identity?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/what-does-the-history-of-victory-day-tell-us-about-russias-national-identity/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1280px-2018_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade_09-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Every year on 9 May, Russia observes Victory Day as its most important national holiday. It celebrates the end of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945) by staging events that dwarf those of any other country. In 2021, the performance in Moscow included 12,000 Russian troops marching through Red Square, followed by tanks and missile launchers, and it concluded with an aerial show of 76 jets and helicopters—one for every year since the victory over Nazi Germany.</p><p>This holiday is designed above all to remind the world of the enormous contributions Russia made in the Great Patriotic War. A few surviving veterans attend the event as a reminder that the Red Army inflicted nearly 90% of all Germany’s combat losses, and civilians across the country solemnly commemorate the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the conflagration (compared, for example, to about 420,000 Americans deaths).</p><p>But Victory Day is not just about the past. It is also about national identity in the present, and as this identity project has changed, so has the memory of the war. In years immediately following 1945, 9 May received scant attention. The country was busy pursuing its global ideological mission of Marxism-Leninism and also in repairing the massive damage it had sustained. But by the end of the 1980s, the declining legitimacy of Communist ideology led authorities to search for other ways to mobilize the population and, in this context, they turned increasingly to Russian nationalism. Among other things, this required a new usable past, giving new meaning to the aphorism: “nothing is so unpredictable as Russia’s past.”</p><p>These transitions were much in evidence in how the Communist Party was depicted in the Great Patriotic War. During the Soviet era, Party members were presented as dedicated, courageous, and selfless fighters at the vanguard of the effort to liberate the USSR and the rest of the world from German fascism. A 1964 Soviet history textbook, for example, told of how troops going on the most dangerous missions said their greatest wish was to be considered a Communist. Textbooks of that era also encouraged students to visit history museums where they could see Communist Party members’ cards pierced by bullet holes and soaked in blood. In this telling, the Party was presented as the leader of the masses as they struggled to rout class enemies in the form of fascist murderers.</p><p>With the collapse of the Soviet Union, this picture underwent a drastic revision. The Party’s legitimacy declined and citizens began expressing doubts and criticisms that would never have been heard in public discourse a few years earlier. Comments that might have been part of private debate “in the kitchen” in Soviet parlance surfaced in the media, memoirs, and even official history textbooks. In the exhilarating discussions of the time, well-established Soviet truths about the Great Patriotic War were replaced by claims that would have landed authors in prison in previous decades.</p><p>For example, a 1995 Russian history textbook blamed the Party-led regime for the fact that the Germans reached the Volga at Stalingrad, something that had never before happened in Russian history. In this new version, it was only when the Party was pushed aside to allow true military professionals to take over that Soviet fortunes improved in the Great Patriotic War, making the Party an <em>impediment</em> rather than a hero in the war effort. The most important new heroes to appear in this post-Soviet narrative were the Russian masses, the Russian nation.</p><p>In short, the transition from the Soviet to post-Soviet era in Russia witnessed a drastic revision in official memory about the most important existential threat of the twentieth century. This might seem to make national memory a fickle servant of political needs, but to leave it at that misses a larger picture. This picture is one a deeper narrative in which the leading actors may change, but the basic plot remains the same. What appears on the surface to be a radical rewrite of national memory turns out to involve the same underlying storyline, and the transition from Soviet to post-Soviet accounts turns out to be a case of telling the same basic story with different characters.</p><p>The stable, underlying story at work in such cases is a “narrative template.” This unconscious narrative code gives rise to mental habits that shape the national memory and national identity more generally. These habits form a coherent perspective that is resistant to change, but one that is also sufficiently protean to accommodate varying accounts of events with their specific dates, places, events, and actors. In the Russian case, the “Expulsion-of-Alien-Enemies” narrative template provides the formula for both the Soviet and post-Soviet account of the Great Patriotic War, and also for other events from previous centuries. It helps explain why the expression “Great Patriotic War” caught on so quickly for Russians in 1941, where the conflict was viewed as another instantiation of the same basic plot for the “Patriotic War” waged against Napoleon more than a century earlier.</p><p>This is a narrative template that shapes Russian understanding of many events in the present as well as the past. For example, it lies behind Vladimir Putin’s frequent beliefs about NATO as a threat—beliefs shared by many Russians but rejected as paranoid by Westerners. All this makes Victory Day an annual event, which, to be sure commemorates the massive losses of the Great Patriotic War, but is also an occasion on which Russians renew their commitment to a national narrative that defines who they are in the twenty-first century.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/663672798/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/663672798/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2f1280px-2018_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade_09-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/shape-and-societal-recovery-from-crises/">SHAPE and societal recovery from crises</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/native-conquistadors-the-role-of-tlaxcala-in-the-fall-of-the-aztec-empire/">Native conquistadors: the role of Tlaxcala in the fall of the Aztec empire</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/the-three-greatest-myths-of-the-fall-of-tenochtitlan/">The three greatest myths of the Fall of Tenochtitl&#xE1;n</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">Climate change made Europe’s flash floods in July more likely</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change has <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/heavy-rainfall-which-led-to-severe-flooding-in-western-europe-made-more-likely-by-climate-change/">increased the likelihood of heavy downpours</a> in Western Europe such as the July rains that led to devastating flash floods, researchers affiliated with the World Weather Attribution network report August 23. Such extreme rains are 1.2 to 9 times more likely to happen — and those downpours are 3 to 19 percent heavier — as a result of human-caused climate change, the team found.</p>



<p>The World Weather Attribution conducts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">quick analyses of extreme events</a> to assess the contribution of climate change (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>). The new study focused on two regions where record-setting rains fell July 12–15 and triggered floods that killed more than 200 people.</p>



<p>In a single day, an average 93 millimeters of rain fell near Germany’s Ahr and Erft rivers; in just two days, 106 millimeters of rain fell in Belgium’s Meuse River region. With many river measurement stations destroyed, the researchers focused on assessing the contribution of climate change to the intense rainfall using climate simulations comparing conditions with and without human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>That intense rainfall might occur once every 400 years under current climate conditions, but those odds are likely to increase as the world continues to warm, said coauthor Maarten van Aalst on August 23 at a news conference on the report. It’s “still a rare event, but a rare event we should prepare for,” said van Aalst, a climate and disaster risk researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.</p>



<p>That finding is consistent with data cited in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report</a>, which notes that as global temperatures continue to rise, western and central Europe will see more intense rainfall events (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-tortoise-video-hunting-killing-eating-baby-bird">A giant tortoise was caught stalking, killing and eating a baby bird</a></h4>

              
                <p>Justin Gerlach thought there must be some sort of misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tortoises don’t hunt. These gentle, lumbering herbivores spend their days leisurely munching on greenery, not stalking prey. His colleague’s report must be mistaken.</p>



<p>But the video was indisputable. On a summer evening in 2020, a female Seychelles giant tortoise (<em>Aldabrachelys gigantea</em>) spent several minutes stalking a young noddy tern (<em>Anous tenuirostris</em>) that had fallen from its nest on Frégate Island in the Seychelles, an archipelago off of East Africa. With plodding determination, the tortoise forced the chick’s retreat down a log, like a pirate walking the plank, until the bird had nowhere to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several slow, deliberate lunges later, the tortoise’s yawning maw caught the bird, crushing its head. Eventually, she swallowed her prize whole. It’s <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00917-9?utm_source=EA">the first documented instance of a tortoise hunting</a>, researchers report August 23 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption>On Frégate Island in the Seychelles, an archipelago off the coast of East Africa, researchers captured the first documented instance of a tortoise — usually a strict herbivore —&nbsp;hunting, killing and eating prey. The giant tortoise stalked a young noddy tern, which fell from its nest, for several minutes before biting and killing the bird.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This was totally unexpected,” says Gerlach, a biologist at the University of Cambridge. Watching the video was “amazing and slightly horrifying.” The footage was captured by coauthor Anna Zora, the conservation and sustainability manager of Frégate Island Sanctuary, the island&#8217;s nature reserve.</p>





<p>Many herbivores will opportunistically scarf down carrion for protein, Gerlach says. And anecdotes of tortoises eating small birds that the reptiles have crushed occasionally surface, “but it’s unclear whether these are deliberate [actions], or they just stepped on something,” he says. Most prey can outrun tortoises, rendering hunting futile. But this grounded noddy tern chick proved easy pickings.</p>





<p>While too young to fly, Gerlach says, the bird could have easily escaped on foot. “But because it’s a tree-nesting bird, ground is a dangerous place.” Once on the log, the chick probably clung to what it knew, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gerlach suspects that this tortoise has hunted before, as its deliberate movements betray prior experience. He plans to investigate whether such hunting behavior occurs with any regularity, but even just this one video has changed his view of these reptiles.</p>



<p>“[People] don&#8217;t think of tortoises as having very interesting behaviors,” he says. “This shows there’s an awful lot more to them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-cool-surface-temperature-failure-lasting-success">Here’s how cool a star can be and still achieve lasting success</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you want to be a successful star by making the minimum possible effort, aim for a surface temperature about a quarter of the sun’s. This is the temperature that a new study says separates red dwarf stars, which shine for a long time, from failed stars known as brown dwarfs.</p>



<p>It’s often hard to distinguish between red and brown dwarfs, because when young they both look the same: red and dim. But only red dwarfs are born with enough mass to sustain the same nuclear reactions that power stars like the sun. In contrast, brown dwarfs glow red primarily from the heat of their birth, but then their nuclear activity sputters out, causing them to cool and fade. Now astrophysicists Dino Hsu and Adam Burgasser at the University of California, San Diego and their colleagues have discerned the dividing line between the two types by exploiting how they move through space.</p>



<p>When a star is born, it revolves around the Milky Way’s center on a fairly circular orbit. Over time, though, gravitational tugs from giant gas clouds, spiral arms and other stars toss the stars to and fro. These perturbations make the stars’ orbits around the galactic center more and more elliptical. Thus, the orbital paths of stars can reveal their approximate age.</p>



<p>Most red dwarfs are fairly old; their predicted lifetimes are far longer than the current age of the universe. But because brown dwarfs cool and fade, any that are still warm are young. Thus, on average, red dwarfs should follow more elliptical orbits around the galaxy than young brown dwarfs do.</p>





<p>In the new study, Hsu’s team analyzed 172 red and brown dwarfs of different spectral types, classifications based on the objects’ spectra that correlate with their surface temperatures. The researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01222">found that a sharp break in stellar motions</a> separates warmer objects, which on average have more elliptical orbits and are older, from cooler ones, which on average have more circular orbits and are younger. This break appears at a spectral type between L4 and L6, corresponding to a surface temperature of about 1200° to 1400° Celsius (1,500 to 1,700 kelvins) — a fraction of the sun&#8217;s surface temperature of about 5500°C (5,800 K) — the team reports July 5 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Above this critical temperature, the dim suns are a mix of long-lived red dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. Below this temperature, though, “it’s all brown dwarfs,” Hsu says. These are the failed stars that are fated to fizzle out. The study will appear in a future issue of the <em>Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.</em></p>



<p>This new method for detecting the temperature boundary between red and brown dwarfs is intriguing, but the result is tentative, says Trent Dupuy, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work. “It’s right around where you would expect,” he says. Dupuy says additional red and brown dwarfs should be observed to verify the finding.</p>



<p>Hsu agrees: “We need a more complete sample.” Expanding the sample will be both easy and hard. On the positive side, red dwarfs abound, outnumbering all other stellar types put together, and brown dwarfs are also common. On the negative side, though, red and brown dwarfs are faint. That makes measuring their Doppler shifts, which reveal how fast the objects move toward or away from Earth, a challenge. But knowing this motion is essential for calculating a star’s orbital path around the galaxy.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Resilience allows you to bounce back when <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">things get hard</a>, whether that’s something as small as a bad day in the office or more serious adverse events. And while it can be easy to think of resilience as something we either do or don’t have, research suggests that isn’t the case: rather, our level of resilience changes in different contexts.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10596011211027676">new study</a>, published in <em>Group &amp; Organization Management, </em>looks closely at resilience in the workplace. It, too, finds that resilience isn’t a static phenomenon, and that it should be seen as something distinctly more flexible instead.</p>



<span id="more-43298"></span>



<p>Participants were members of a marching band at a university in the United States, chosen because of the high levels of commitment and effort that were required for them to remain on top of performances and practice. Participants first indicated whether or not they were new to the band and completed a measure of emotional stability, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I change my mood a lot”.</p>



<p>Then, every week over a twelve week period, participants completed scales measuring emotional exhaustion (e.g. “I feel emotionally drained”) and commitment (e.g. “I feel a strong sense of belonging to the marching band”), and stated how high their workload was. Finally, at the end of the period participants indicated whether they <em>intended</em> to stay in the band. The researchers also looked at whether they actually remained in the band during the next season.</p>



<p>As the term and study went on, band members felt that their workload increased, with more demands being placed on them. This increased workload was also accompanied by increasing feelings of burnout and emotional exhaustion, and decreasing levels of commitment and belonging.</p>



<p><a></a>This increase in feelings of burnout across the course of the study was similar for people who were high and low in emotional stability. However, when it came to commitment, those higher in emotional stability were more likely to remain committed and retain feelings of belonging than those low in the trait, who experienced a slow decline throughout the twelve weeks. Those new to the group were also more likely to remain engaged than those who had been members for a longer period of time, and showed less of an increase in burnout over the course of the 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Trajectories that show less of an increase in burnout and continued commitment in the face of increased workload are reflective of resilience, write the authors. So the key takeaway from the results is that resilience isn’t simply a case of personal character. Though emotional stability did impact how committed participants were, other factors including how long they’d been involved in the band also influenced these trajectories.</p>



<p>As you might expect, there was also a relationship between feelings of commitment and intent to stay in the band. Those who remained at the same level of commitment (or whose commitment increased across the course of the study) were more likely to say they wanted to return to the band, and to actually do so. Levels of resilience, therefore, had a material impact on the make-up of the band and participants’ experience of being part of it.</p>



<p>The study shows that resilience is a process, the authors say — one that fluctuates over time rather than staying stable. This may make annual employee surveys somewhat moot, they argue: because they happen only once a year, they’re unable to capture the shifting complexities of resilience, burnout, and likelihood of employee retention, which are likely to change from month to month, project to project, and person to person. Taking a more flexible approach to resilience — as well as employee wellbeing more generally — could be a better way of maintaining a healthier workplace.</p>



<p>Future research could look at protective factors: are there things that groups or organisations can do internally to foster resilience, belonging and commitment? <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/18/when-bosses-are-respectful-young-people-are-more-resilient-at-work-and-enjoy-their-jobs-more/">Other recent research</a>, for example, has looked at the positive impact of cultures of respect within workplaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-number-line-space-map-different-directions">Everyone maps numbers in space. But why don’t we all use the same directions?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consider a ruler, a timeline or even weights lined up in a gym. Why are the smaller values, the earlier times and the lighter weights typically on the left and the larger or later values on the right? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Since at least <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-44067-001">the early 1990s,</a> researchers have debated whether these mental number lines, or the tendency to order numerically from left to right, are innate or learned. In more recent years, this debate has broadened from mental number lines to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839568/">mental magnitude lines:</a> the human tendency to map any abstract idea, such as numbers, time and even facial expressions, in three-dimensional space. Now, an August 11 study in <em>Science Advances, </em>comparing mostly adult Indigenous farmer-foragers in Bolivia to U.S. preschoolers and adults has <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/33/eabg4141">fallen squarely on the learning or culture side,</a> adding fresh fuel to the debate.</p>



<p>For these Bolivians, known as the Tsimane people, “numbers increase in one direction. Time increases in one direction. Size increases in one direction. But any direction will do,” says cognitive scientist Benjamin Pitt of the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, with little formal schooling telling them which way to position numbers in space, the Tsimane people do not care, in theory, if heavier dumbbells sit on the right or the left.</p>



<p>More than an esoteric debate, researchers suspect that understanding how humans map abstract ideas in space could provide clues about the development of spatial reasoning. The thinking is that these maps “are a foundation upon which later mathematical and spatial abilities build,” says cognitive scientist Kensy Cooperrider, who recently completed his postdoctoral work at the University of Chicago and is now based in San Diego.</p>





<p>Pitt and colleagues first asked members of three groups — 96 Tsimane teens and adults, 31 U.S. preschoolers and 18 U.S. adults — to arrange items on a horizontal board. All the participants lined up five index cards covered in one to five dots or five blocks ranging in size from 1 to 5 inches. While the U.S. adults all mapped the cards and blocks from smallest on the left to largest on the right, the Tsimane adults and U.S. preschoolers were equally likely to map in either direction, the team found.</p>



<p>Then the team evaluated how a new group of 60 Tsimane teens and adults mapped information along the x, y and sagittal (front to back) axes. Besides asking participants to order items by size and number, the researchers also tested to see whether the Tsimane people mapped time to space. In that trial, the team asked them to order five sets of bananas ranging in color, or ripeness, from very green to almost black. Each participant completed three mapping tasks per axis for a total of nine tasks.</p>



<p>Again, the Tsimane people showed little directional bias. A single participant often ordered one concept one way on a given axis, such as the lower magnitude green bananas on the bottom, and another concept the other way, such as the higher magnitude five-dot index card on the bottom. The researchers tallied when each participant placed all the cards in the same direction on a given axis and when they did not. Averaging the scores across participants, the researchers found that mappings went in the same direction only 42 percent of the time.</p>



<p>“This study casts doubt on the idea that many psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have held that we have an innate system for spatializing numbers,” says Cooperrider, who reached similar conclusions in a 2017 study testing <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617691548">mental number lines among the Yupno people</a> of Papua, New Guinea.</p>



<p>The debate is far from closed, though, says cognitive scientist Stella Lourenco of Emory University in Atlanta. Tsimane participants did show some consistencies. For instance, any given individual ordered the size and number cards the same way along the x, y and sagittal axes about 80 percent of the time. “They look at these data and say there is inconsistency. I look at these data and I say, ‘It looks pretty good to me in terms of consistency,’” Lourenco says.</p>



<p>Lourenco suspects that people might be born with innate mental maps, as indicated by research on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676679/">newborn babies</a>, but life experience obscures those default tendencies. For instance, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07534-007">Arabic speakers</a>, who read from right to left, also tend to place lower magnitude items on the right — the reverse of native English speakers. “Even if you believe in a default or innate directionality,” she says, “directionality is flexible.”</p>



<p>The bigger question, says cognitive scientist Rosa Rugani of the University of Padua in Italy, is how people build their mental maps. What experiences, for instance, make Tsimane people more likely to map the number and size cards in the same direction than the number and time cards?</p>



<p>What’s more, Rugani says, a laser focus on directionality has obscured what’s arguably the most intriguing question of all: Why does everyone from preschoolers to the Yupno and Tsimane people map abstract ideas in space at all? “We really need to return to the origins of this topic,” she says.</p>

<p><strong>The W particle may have been found</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-may-have-been-found"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 21, 1971</p>



<p>Physicists distinguish four different kinds of force by which objects in the universe act upon each other: the strong nuclear force, the weak force, electromagnetism and gravity. The developed theory of particle physics outfits each force with a so-called intermediate particle.… Now, from an abandoned silver mine at Park City, Utah, comes strong evidence of the existence of the weak-force quantum, known as the … W particle.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The “strong evidence” for this W particle, or W boson, fell apart under additional scrutiny. Physicists with CERN near Geneva finally <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-physics-missing-link-found">caught the boson</a> about a decade later (<em>SN: 2/5/83, p. 84</em>). Besides helping mediate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">the weak force</a>, which governs certain types of radioactive decay, the W boson has also helped scientists catch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">the Higgs boson</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/12, p. 5</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/higgs-running-out-hiding-places">Weighing the W boson</a> narrowed down the Higgs’ mass range, making the Higgs easier to look for. Physicists continue unraveling W boson mysteries, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03256-1">how the particles form</a> and whether <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2021-026/">more massive versions</a> exist.</p>

                <p>Paleontologists can spend years carefully splitting rocks in search of the perfect fossil. But with a 310-million-year-old horseshoe crab brain, nature did the work, breaking the fossil in just the right way to reveal the ancient arthropod’s central nervous system.</p>



<p>Of all soft tissues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-fossilized-dinosaur-brain-unearthed-scientists-claim">brains</a> are notoriously difficult to preserve in any form (<em>SN: 10/31/16</em>). Stumbling across such a detailed specimen purely by chance was “a one-in-a-million find, if not rarer,” says evolutionary paleontologist Russell Bicknell of the University of New England in Armidale, Australia.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G49193.1/606398/Central-nervous-system-of-a-310-m-y-old-horseshoe">fossilized brain</a> is remarkably similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, giving clues to the arthropods’ evolution, Bicknell and colleagues report July 26 in <em>Geology</em>. And the brain’s peculiar mode of preservation could point paleontologists toward new places to look for hard-to-find fossils of soft tissues.</p>



<p>Horseshoe crabs have a fossil record spanning roughly 445 million years. But having a long fossil record is one thing. For many animals, including the crabs, fossils of their soft tissues are extremely uncommon because the tissues tend to degrade far quicker than fossilization can occur. Finding the delicate fatty structures that form a brain preserved in rock is especially rare. Only about 20 samples of fossilized arthropod neural tissue have been identified to date.</p>





<p>The newly described brain — part of a larger fossil of the extinct <em>Euproops danae</em> that Bicknell found at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History — was originally dug up from the Mazon Creek fossil beds roughly an hour southwest of Chicago. That site is one of the only known places in the world that could have saved the brain’s structure, says paleontologist Victoria McCoy of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.</p>



<p>“The fossilization at Mazon Creek is really, really exceptional,” McCoy explains. “It’s interesting because the fossils are preserved inside concretions,” which are spherical rocks that form around a central nugget of material, such as a long-dead crab. Most concretions in other fossil beds have no fossils or fossils that are just bones and hard parts, but “Mazon Creek has really good, soft-tissue preservation inside these concretions,” she says.</p>



<p>That’s because the concretions there are partly made of an iron-carbonate mineral called siderite that only forms in low-oxygen environments. That low-oxygen setting almost certainly slowed tissue decay, the scientists say, giving it time to be preserved. In an oxygenated environment, the decay could have happened in weeks, and the brain would have probably wasted away too quickly.</p>



<p>The actual process of preservation was a multistep ordeal, Bicknell says. “First, of course, the horseshoe crab had to die.” As the crab decayed, surrounded by mud and not much oxygen, that siderite coated the crab’s body, allowing it and its fragile brain structure to be preserved. After the brain degraded, the siderite “mold” was filled in with a pale, clay mineral called kaolinite, creating a white brain structure that stands out starkly on the otherwise tan fossil. Over time, a sphere of rock formed around the fossil before eventually breaking open in a fortuitous way.</p>

Bicknell <em>et al</em>/<em>Geology</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on studies in similar modern environments, such as the North Norfolk marshes in England, the whole preservation process probably took fewer than 50 years, McCoy says. That’s much faster than some other fossilization processes, which can take thousands of years or more. “Neural tissue degrades fairly quickly. We have no reason to think it would be stable,” she says. “While we don’t completely understand how concretions form, all the evidence so far is that it’s the concretion itself that is the preservation force keeping things from decaying away.”</p>



<p>The high preservation quality in these siderite concretions may point paleontologists in new directions for finding soft-tissue fossils. Only several environments capable of producing siderite concretions in the rock record have been identified so far, but the sites could be practical targets for future fossil searches.</p>



<p>“The most important part here is that purely by chance, the fossil was split along its brain,” Bicknell says. The concretion was cracked in just the right orientation to reveal a near-perfect cross section of the brain’s structure. “If it hadn’t broken that way, we wouldn’t have this level of information. It was ultimately quite lucky.”</p>



<p>The preserved central nervous system lends insight into the ancient crab’s behavior, the researchers say. Because the fossil brain is so similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, Bicknell says, it’s safe to say the ancient animal’s walking, breathing and even feeding habits were probably similar to horseshoe crabs’ today, including eating with their legs. “Imagine eating a hamburger with your elbows,” Bicknell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sports-soccer-ghost-games-psychology-fans-referee-pandemic">‘Ghost games’ spotlight the psychological effect fans have on referees</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the fans are away, the home team loses its sway, new research suggests.<br><br>During the 2019–2020 season, European soccer teams played in front of vacant stadium seats <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans">due to COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). Home teams won less, lost more and tied about the same, compared with the season before the pandemic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Frontiers in Sports and Active Living</em>. What’s more, referees doled out much more foul calls to home teams than before during these crowdless “ghost games.”</p>



<p>The findings add to evidence that fans influence home team advantage — the phenomenon where athletes tend to do better on their own turf. “No fans, no home advantage,” says sports psychologist Fabio Richlan of the University of Salzburg in Austria.</p>



<p>Richlan and Michael Leitner, a sports psychologist also at the University of Salzburg, compared the outcomes of 645 games for the 2018–2019 season with the outcomes of 641 ghost games for the 2019–2020 season. Countries included in the analysis were Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and Czech Republic.</p>



<p>With stands mostly or entirely empty, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.720488/full">home team win rate decreased</a> by 8.3 percentage points, from 48.1 percent to 39.8 percent, the researchers found. Meanwhile, loss rate increased by 8.4 percentage points, from 27.6 percent to 36 percent.</p>



<p>To examine how fan pressure on referees might have contributed to the discrepancy, the researchers looked at how often referees issued foul calls in the form of yellow cards. With fans absent, foul calls against home teams increased by around 26 percent, while calls against away teams increased by only about 3 percent.  <br><br>“Referees indeed give advantage to the home teams, because of the crowds,” Leitner says. But the findings suggest that referee bias tends to disappear when fans do. While it’s natural for people to change their opinions under pressure from others, Leitner says, hopefully this work can help referees become more aware of their biases. “When you know it, you can train against it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">Conspiracy Theories Are More “Entertaining” Than The Truth — And This Helps Explain Why People Believe Them</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Conspiracy theories stoke anxiety and uncertainty and can even threaten the health of those who espouse them. Take Covid-19 anti-vaxxers, for example, who put themselves at risk by refusing a vaccine. So given those negative consequences, it’s surprising that conspiracy theories are so prolific.</p>



<p>Research shows that beliefs that other groups are colluding secretly to pursue malevolent goals (the definition of a conspiracy theory) are more common during times of crisis — like a global pandemic. Heightened anxiety is thought to lead people to (erroneously) believe that there are hostile forces at play. But now <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12522?af=R">a paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> reveals another reason for why conspiracy theories can be appealing. Jan-Willem van Prooijen at the Free University Amsterdam and colleagues found that conspiracy theories provoke a stronger emotional reaction than relatively dull-but-true reality — and this encourages belief in them, especially for people who have the personality trait of being &#8220;sensation-seeking&#8221;.</p>



<span id="more-43248"></span>



<p>In two initial studies, participants read either a conspiratorial or an accurate story about the Notre Dame fire in Paris (which was in reality a tragic accident, but in the conspiratorial version was set on fire deliberately) or the death of the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (who died by suicide in his cell, but in the conspiratorial version was ‘murdered’ by powerful people). Finally, all participants were asked whether they believed that there was a conspiracy behind the fire or death of Epstein.</p>



<p>The team found that participants who had read the conspiracy text also reported stronger belief in the conspiracy theory in both cases. But importantly, the conspiracy text was also judged to be more entertaining, and it seemed to be this “entertainment value” that ultimately led these participants to have a stronger belief in the conspiracy theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A further study more clearly linked the emotive nature of a text to its entertainment value. &nbsp;This time, participants read either an emotion-laden or emotionless description of a fictitious election, with no reference to any conspiracy theories. The text with lots of emotion was deemed to be more entertaining and also provoked a stronger emotional reaction. What’s more, even though it didn’t mention any conspiracies, participants who’d read this text were more likely to agree with conspiracy-related statements (such as &#8220;There will be cheating in the results counting process&#8221; or &#8220;A conspiracy will determine the election outcome&#8221;) — but only <em>if </em>they also scored relatively highly on a measure of sensation-seeking.</p>



<p>Sensation-seekers love excitement and thrills; they also enjoy scary movies and new and risky experiences, for example. And, according to yet another study reported in the paper, employees who score higher on the sensation-seeking dimensions of boredom susceptibility, disinhibition and adventure-seeking are more likely to believe that their&nbsp;bosses secretly pursue malevolent goals — in other words, to believe in workplace conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>A final study assessed participants’ belief in various common conspiracy theories, such as that the US government had advance knowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that NASA faked the Moon landings. The researchers found a link between the strength of these beliefs and scores on the three dimensions of sensation-seeking identified in the employee study. “The results reveal that sensation seeking reliably predicts people’s belief in specific and concrete conspiracy theories,” they write.</p>



<p>So — yes, conspiracy theories may make people feel more anxious and uncertain. But perhaps sensation-seekers not only don’t mind this, they even enjoy it. The researchers add that to have this effect and attract believers, a conspiracy theory would have to be at least somewhat credible. But let’s not forget that some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk">12 million Americans </a>reportedly believe that the US is ruled by giant lizards…&nbsp; Scores on the sensation-seeking scale alone clearly don’t explain that extreme type of misguided belief. But given just how common conspiracy theories are, any insight into what encourages people to believe them is interesting.</p>



<p>Of course, the idea that adding emotion to a factual story makes it more appealing is hardly new: news outlets and true crime podcasts do it all the time. But this new work does also perhaps imply that the more entertaining we can make the truth, the more likely that sensation-seekers will buy into it, rather than a twisted alternative.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-greater-sac-winged-bats-babble-learn-mating-songs">These baby greater sac-winged bats babble to learn their mating songs</a></h4>

              
                <p>At least 65 million years of evolution separate humans and greater sac-winged bats, but these two mammals share a key feature of learning how to speak: babbling.</p>



<p>Just as human infants babble their way from “da-da-da-da” to “Dad,” wild bat pups (<em>Saccopteryx bilineata</em>) learn the mating and territorial songs of adults <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abf9279">by first babbling out the fundamental syllables of the vocalizations,</a> researchers report in the Aug. 20 <em>Science</em>. These bats now join humans as the only clear examples of mammals who learn to make complex vocalizations through babbling.</p>



<p>“This is a hugely important step forward in the study of vocal learning,” says Tecumseh Fitch, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Vienna not involved in the new study. “These findings suggest that there are deep parallels between how humans and young bats learn to control their vocal apparatus,” he says. The work could enable future studies that might allow researchers to peer deeper into the brain activity that underpins vocal learning.</p>



<p>Before complex vocalizations, whether words or mating songs, can be spoken or sung, vocalizers must learn to articulate the syllables that make up a species’s vocabulary, says Ahana Fernandez, an animal behavior biologist at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. “Babbling is a way of practicing,” and honing those vocalizations, she says.</p>





<p>The rhythmic, repetitive “ba-ba-ba’s” and “ga-ga-ga’s” of human infants may sound like gibberish, but they are necessary exploratory steps toward learning how to talk. Seeing whether babbling is required for <em>any</em> animal that learns complex vocalizations necessitates looking in other species.</p>



<p>Many songbirds babble to learn their songs. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-marmosets-imitate-parents-sounds">marmosets babble too</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/15</em>), but only to solicit care, for example, not to learn a complex vocal repertoire, Fernandez says. Another mammal, the greater sac-winged bat, had been <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/16736178">heard making babbling-like sounds</a> in 2006. Males of this highly social species combine 25 different syllable types into songs used to defend territories and attract mates, but the babbling behavior wasn’t formally studied. Fernandez sought to change that by getting up close and personal with the bats.</p>



<p>At bat colonies in Panama and Costa Rica, Fernandez spent a couple of weeks before pups were born slowly inching closer to the adult animals, habituating them to her presence. By the time the pups arrived and started babbling, she could spend all day camped just meters from the bats. She observed and recorded the sounds of 20 pups over three months as the bats developed their vocal repertoire by imitating male tutors. All told, she and her colleagues captured and analyzed 55,056 syllables from 216 bouts of babbling.</p>



<p>Overall, “bat pup babbling is defined by the same characteristics as human infant babbling,” Fernandez says. Like humans and other babblers, the behavior started early in development, a little over two weeks after the bats’ birth. Protosyllables (akin to human “ba’s” or “ga’s”) were the most prevalent sound made and exhibited lots of variability. These seemingly playful experimentations might help pups shape their vocalizations to match adults, Fernandez explains. Syllables were repeated and were rhythmic, both common features of babbling.</p>

<h3>Babbling baby bats</h3>



<p>A greater sac-winged bat pup makes babbling sounds as it learns how to vocalize like adults. Adult male bats of this species (<em>Saccopteryx bilineata</em>), which live in Central and South America, attract mates and defend territories with songs.</p>

</div>



<p>Like humans, both male and female pups babbled, even though female bats don’t sing as adults. That is vastly different from most songbirds, where only the males are known to babble and sing.</p>



<p>“Females might use [their babbling experience] as a template” for making mating decisions as adults about which bats are better singers, Fernandez says.</p>



<p>The bats may not babble exactly like other known babblers, says Pralle Kriengwatana, a behavioral biologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland who wasn’t involved in the study. Compared with some songbirds, “this ability to produce adultlike syllables seems to happen much quicker in bats,” she says, noting an abrupt rise in the number of adultlike syllables early in babbling. That rapid expansion might mean that practice through babbling is less important for certain bat syllables than growing the neurological and physiological capacity through normal development, she says.</p>



<p>“Obviously, the bats are babbling,” says Ofer Tchernichovski, an ethologist at the City University of New York’s Hunter College. He hopes the babbling behavior will be confirmed in a more controlled laboratory setting, and, more generally, he says he’s glad to have another animal through which to study vocal learning. “Songbirds are nice, but they’re very far from us.” By investigating another mammal, this research “opens the door,” he says, for studying the neural underpinnings of language’s fundamental building blocks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">How coronavirus vaccines still help people who already had COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some people who have been infected with coronavirus have questioned whether they really need vaccines. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people get vaccinated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">regardless of whether they’ve already had COVID-19</a>. That’s in part because it’s still unclear how long immunity lasts after an infection. Studies have shown that antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-variant-immunity">hang around in the blood for at least eight months</a> after getting sick, but some recovered patients <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong">have gotten reinfected</a> (<em>SN: 6/11/21;</em> <em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>COVID-19 jabs give the immune systems of people who were previously infected an extra leg up to fight the coronavirus, including against new, more transmissible variants, other research shows. And because the delta variant, first identified in India, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">can spread among vaccinated people</a>, that extra layer of protection for recovered patients is probably helpful (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>).</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>“If you’ve had exposure to COVID before, don’t think you’re immune to variants,” says Benjamin Ollivere, a trauma surgeon who studies COVID-19 at the University of Nottingham in England. “Have your vaccines.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the evidence that even recovered people benefit from the shots is mounting. Based on the latest studies, here’s what experts know about past infections and getting vaccinated.</p>



<h4>One dose may work, but two could be better</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-infection-one-shot-two-dose-coronavirus-vaccine">One vaccine dose might be sufficient</a> to protect people who have already had COVID-19, lab-based studies suggest (<em>SN: 3/3/21</em>). One shot for those who recovered from a prior infection boosts <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2782762">virus-attacking antibodies to levels similar to those of vaccinated people</a> who got two doses of an mRNA vaccine, researchers reported August 6 in <em>JAMA.</em> A second dose, however, didn’t further increase antibody levels for previously infected people.</p>



<p>Antibodies aren’t the only part of the immune response that benefit from the vaccine, although the immune proteins are crucial to prevent infection. A single shot was enough for recovered patients to reach <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01004-4#%20">high levels of a subset of immune cells called T cells</a>, researchers reported August 3 in <em>Cell Reports</em>. T cells help coordinate and ramp up the immune response when a person is exposed to the virus again.</p>



<p>That suggests that people who had COVID-19 and then were vaccinated with a single dose could be as protected as fully vaccinated people who were never sick. But whether that plays out in the real world, outside the lab, is unclear.</p>



<p>A CDC-led study of previously infected people offers a hint. Kentucky residents who had recovered from a coronavirus infection but weren’t vaccinated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm">were around twice as likely to get infected again</a> as their vaccinated counterparts, researchers report August 6 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>People who were only partially vaccinated — meaning they had received only one of two mRNA vaccine doses or had finished a vaccine regimen less than two weeks prior to being infected — were about 1.5 times as likely to be reinfected as fully vaccinated people. So, even one shot offers protection, but two doses could be slightly better. (One caveat is that few people in the study were partially vaccinated, making it harder to estimate the risk of infection.)</p>



<p>Larger studies will help pinpoint whether previously infected people need more than one dose for protection, the researchers say.</p>





<h4>Shots are the best defense against variants</h4>



<p>Using a single shot to protect previously infected people is promising, but the spread of delta and other variants has called into question whether that single shot is enough.</p>



<p>Lab-based studies suggest that even a single COVID-19 shot makes antibodies from previously infected people better at recognizing other versions of the coronavirus. One mRNA vaccine dose was enough to increase infection-halting antibodies to levels <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1413">up to 1,000 times higher than before vaccination</a>, researchers reported in the June 25 <em>Science. </em>That was true not only for an early version of the virus from China, but also the beta variant, which first emerged in South Africa, and the closely related virus that caused the 2003–2004 SARS outbreak.</p>



<p>Survivors of that 2003–2004 outbreak also benefit from COVID-19 vaccines. Antibodies from vaccinated SARS survivors could stop <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108453">not only the coronaviruses behind SARS and COVID-19 from infecting cells</a>, but also animal coronaviruses from bats and pangolins, researchers reported August 18 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Increasing the amount of time between two vaccine doses can also <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/08/10/scitranslmed.abj0847">help antibodies learn to recognize different coronavirus variants</a>, Ollivere and colleagues report August 10 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Previously infected, fully vaccinated heath care workers in the United Kingdom — where officials allow shots to be given up to 12 weeks apart rather than the standard three or four — had antibodies that could attack variants including beta.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>It’s unclear whether the findings would be the same for the delta variant, but Ollivere expects that antibodies from previously infected, vaccinated people should fight that variant off too. That should hold true as long as there are no major structural changes in the spike protein, which would help the virus better hide from antibodies, he notes. “And we know delta doesn’t have structural changes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate study supports that hypothesis. Previously infected and vaccinated health care workers in France had antibodies that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9">recognized delta better than antibodies from workers who were infected</a> only, researchers reported in the Aug. 12 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<h4>There’s hope that vaccines can tackle yet-to-be-seen variants, too</h4>



<p>The more people the coronavirus infects, the more mutations it will pick up, making some experts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">concerned that more worrisome variants</a> than delta may be on the horizon (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). But the immune system is apt at rolling with the punches, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">continually refining its antibody arsenal</a> to better recognize even mutated forms of the virus (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>One recent experiment offers even more evidence of vaccine-induced antibodies’ ability to recognize emerging variants. Antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients who had been vaccinated stopped a version of coronavirus with 20 changes in it spike protein. The spike protein acts as a key to unlock and infect cells, but <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.455491v1">even with all the changes, antibodies still prevented the virus from infecting cells</a>, researchers reported August 8 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>In the study, which has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, virologists Fabian Schmidt, Yiska Weisblum and colleagues engineered a harmless animal virus that doesn’t make people sick to sport mutated coronavirus spikes. The virus with 20 changes could replicate in lab-grown cells, but it didn’t fare as well as a version of the virus without those mutations — which suggests that the combination of mutations had negative consequences for the virus.</p>



<p>The team then tested how well antibodies from vaccinated or recovered people attacked the mutated virus. “The main question was, ‘What will it take for this virus to evade immunity?’” says Weisblum, of Rockefeller University in New York City.</p>



<p>Those 20 changes to the spike protein were enough to make the virus resistant to antibodies from vaccinated people who were never exposed to the virus, as well as antibodies from previously infected people who never got their shots. But people who were previously infected and vaccinated still had other antibodies that recognized the virus and stopped it from infecting cells — a sign that their immune system had adapted to better recognize its target.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible that a virus with that many mutations in the spike protein will pop up somewhere around the world and cause problems even among vaccinated people, though that remains to be seen, says Schmidt, also of Rockefeller University. Current variants of concern like beta and delta have around 10 spike mutations. If the virus did accumulate more mutations, booster shots should protect people, the finding suggests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As antibodies evolve over time, they “know what to do,” Weisblum says. Future vaccines might include slightly varied versions of the virus, to help the body craft a strong immune response. But even if researchers can’t predict how the virus might change in the future, she says, “the immune system will take care of the rest.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If proof of the existence or otherwise of a god-like deity was available, would you want to see it? What if you had access to a file that revealed whether your partner had ever been unfaithful? And would you take a new genetic test that would indicate whether you have a mutation linked to an incurable disease?</p>



<p>&#8220;All men, by nature, desire to know,&#8221; wrote Aristotle, more than 2,000 years ago. In fact, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-41153-001?CheckAccess=1">new paper</a> in <em>Psychology and Aging</em> point out, philosophers have long viewed people as having a thirst for knowledge, and a drive to resolve uncertainty. However, as Ralph Hertwig at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany and his colleagues also note, there are times when we prefer not to know the truth, and even bury our heads in the sand. Older people are often seen as being more prone to doing this. And the team’s research now suggests that this is indeed the case: people aged over 51 were more likely than younger people to choose to remain ignorant of information that would have an emotional impact on them — perhaps a positive impact, but perhaps a negative one.</p>



<span id="more-43243"></span>



<p>The team analysed interview responses from just under 2,000 residents of Germany aged 21 and over. The participants indicated whether or not they’d want knowledge about 13 scenarios. These included: knowledge of the date of their own death; the faithfulness of a future spouse; colleagues’ bonus payments; their genetic predisposition for various diseases; and the authenticity of a supposedly valuable statue in their possession. The team also included one extra item — knowledge of a job applicant’s gender and appearance — to look at people’s response to a type of knowledge that might be avoided in a bid to avoid bias, rather than an emotional reaction. The team then calculated the percentage of each participant’s responses in which they said they’d &#8220;prefer not to know&#8221;, which became their &#8220;Deliberate Ignorance&#8221; scores. Next, the team looked at scores for people in seven different age bands, from 21-30, 31-40 and so on, to 81-99.</p>



<p>As the age of participants increased, the group aged 51-60 was the first to show &#8220;substantial&#8221; differences in Deliberate Ignorance, with more “prefer not to know” responses compared to younger age groups. This increase in Deliberate Ignorance increased as participants got older still. In fact, the authors write, it “occurred quite consistently across items, with one exception” —  the job applicant’s gender and appearance. Participants of all ages had a strong and consistent preference not to know this information. So, it seems that older people are not more likely to avoid knowledge of any kind, but rather types of knowledge that might trigger an emotion, and call on them to regulate their emotions. Why might this be?</p>



<p>The team did assess the personality trait of openness, which is linked to being receptive to new and challenging thoughts and emotions, and which is known to decline with age. However, in their data, they didn’t find much of a link between openness and age. Perhaps, then, there’s a practical influence, they theorised: older adults’ relatively shorter life expectancy may reduce the usefulness of certain types of information, especially health-related information — and the data did support this. The biggest differences in deliberate ignorance item scores between the two oldest age groups and the youngest was for health-related items.</p>



<p>However, another idea may also be relevant here. &#8220;Socioemotional selectivity theory&#8221; holds that when people perceive their future as being wide open, they tend to prioritise goals that relate to the future — gathering information, expanding their horizons, and so on. But when people see their future as being more limited — and older people belong to this group — they focus more on the present, and, for them, emotional satisfaction is more of a priority. Older people may then strive to minimise the risk of receiving potentially negative information, even if that means that they give up the chance to get positive information (to discover that they in fact don’t carry a genetic variant linked to Alzheimer’s disease, say).</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed to tease apart the potential influences on the results. But for older people, avoiding the risk of disturbing negative emotions may explain why they are more deliberately ignorant than younger people. As the researchers write: “uncertainty in the present may be preferable to what may turn out to be a distressing certainty in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">See some of the most intriguing photos from NASA’s Perseverance rover so far</a></h4>

              
                <p>In February, NASA’s Perseverance rover touched down on Mars and went to work. The rover has seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">the first flight of a Martian robot</a>, gotten its drill bit dirty and begun traversing the floor of Jezero crater, thought to be the remains of an ancient lake (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>And what Perseverance is finding isn’t exactly what scientists expected. “The crater floor is super interesting,” says planetary scientist Briony Horgan of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., one of the mission’s long-term science planners. “We didn’t really know what we were getting into from orbit.”</p>





<p>Perseverance is getting views of enormous boulders that may have been transported by ancient floods, fine rock layers that look like they settled in calm waters, and rocks with large crystals that look volcanic. The rover’s landing site may include a volcanic lava flow from long ago, or signs of an earlier episode of water — or something else.</p>





<p>“It’s not as obvious as we thought,” Horgan says. “Whatever it is, it’s cool.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the image highlights from the rover so far.</p>



<h3>Taking the long view</h3>



<p>Before the rover landed, the Perseverance team knew that Jezero crater looked like the dry basin of an ancient lake, with a river delta flowing into it. The prospect of finding preserved lake floor sediments made the site good for searching for past life, one of the mission’s primary goals.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true" class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1.png" alt="brown, rocky ground with some layered rock" class="wp-image-3102734" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1.png 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-680x264.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-800x311.png 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-330x128.png 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-768x298.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102734">This picture, taken March 17, is a mosaic of five images taken with Perseverance’s Remote Microscopic Imager camera.

<p>Perseverance took this snapshot March 17 of a steep slope in a part of Jezero’s delta, from more than two kilometers away. The rover probably won’t reach that spot until sometime next year. But already, the rover’s Remote Microscopic Imager camera is uncovering details that could reveal new insight into the crater’s watery past.</p>



<p>For example, the tilted layers of sedimentary rock and cementlike mixtures of coarse sand and pebbles in this rock feature, nicknamed “Delta Scarp,” confirm the delta’s wet history. There are also individual large boulders cemented into the front of the scarp, suggesting that the region saw high floods, says Perseverance deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<h3>Closer to home</h3>



<p>Even eroded outcrops close to Perseverance’s landing site look like they had a watery history. This image of a remnant of part of the delta rising out of the crater floor was taken with Perseverance’s Mastcam-Z camera February 22.</p>

<p>“Many of us expected these outcrops to be quite uninteresting, based on orbital data,” Stack Morgan says. But images from the ground showed beautiful layers, just like what you would find in a deep-lake deposit.</p>



<p>“We weren’t expecting to find them here, but maybe they’re right next door to our landing site,” she says. These outcrops could be remnants of the edge of the lake that used to fill Jezero crater or could represent an even older lake that was replaced.</p>



<h3>Even closer</h3>



<p>Perseverance is taking close-ups of the rocks around it too. This closeup image of a rock nicknamed “Foux” was taken July 11 using the WATSON camera on the end of the rover’s robotic arm. The area in the image is only about 4 centimeters by 3 centimeters.</p>

It shows textured rocks with an interesting coating that might indicate interaction with water. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102729">JPL-Caltech/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The textures in this image are fascinating, as are the “crazy red coatings” that are more purple than typical Mars dust, Horgan says. “What rocks are these?” The coatings probably imply alteration by water, and the purple color suggests that they contain some iron, she adds.</p>



<h3>Volcanic grains?</h3>



<p>Perseverance has also found evidence of igneous, or volcanic, rocks on Jezero’s crater floor. That wasn’t surprising — observations from orbit suggested that volcanic rocks should be there, and scientists hoped to pick up some to help researchers back on Earth figure out the rocks’ absolute ages. Right now, the timing of past events on Mars is based on the sizes of craters and the ages of rocks from the moon, and it’s not extremely precise.</p>

<p>Igneous rocks on Mars tend to be old and preserve a record of their ages well. “If you want to figure out when things happened on Mars, you want an igneous rock,” Stack Morgan says.</p>



<p>On the ground, though, things are a little more complicated. This rock was the first that Perseverance cleared dust from in preparation for taking a sample. The image shows mysterious holes, which could have been formed by erosion or by air bubbles trapped in lava as it cooled. And the surface is divided into light and dark patches that could be individual crystals, or cemented grains.</p>



<p>If they’re crystals, that suggests volcanic activity, Stack Morgan says — but these crystals are bigger than expected for lava that would have cooled at the planet’s surface. Similar crystals form deep in the subsurface of Earth, where magma solidifies slowly. When lava cools at Earth’s surface, the crystals “don’t have time to grow big,” Stack Morgan says. The next step, she says, is “thinking through how rocks like this could have formed here, if they are indeed igneous or volcanic rocks. How would we get a rock that looks like this?” Maybe this rock formed underground and was transported to the surface, but it’s not clear how.</p>



<h3>First sample attempt</h3>



<p>That same rock carried more surprises when the rover team tried to drill into it August 6. The drill worked perfectly, to the team’s elation. “One of the most complex robotic systems ever designed and executed worked perfectly with no faults the first time,” Stack Morgan says. “We were like ‘Oh my god, this is amazing.’”</p>



<p>But when they looked inside the tube that was meant to capture the rock sample, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/320/assessing-perseverances-first-sample-attempt/">it was empty</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s been a bit of an emotional roller coaster,” Stack Morgan says.</p>

These images were taken August 6.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102731">JPL-Caltech/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team thinks that the rock was more crumbly than expected, and essentially turned to dust. “The rock was not able to keep its act together,” Stack Morgan says. The drill is designed to sweep the small grains produced in the drilling process, called cuttings, up and out of the sample tube. Stack Morgan thinks the entire sample was treated as cuttings and ended up in a pile of dust on the ground.</p>



<p>There is a silver lining: Now the rover has a sealed sample of Martian atmosphere. And the rover will attempt to take another sample of a hardier rock sometime soon, Stack Morgan says.</p>



<h3>In the wind</h3>



<p>Mars may have had lakes and rivers in its past, but today the dry, dusty landscape is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">shaped mostly by wind</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>). Perseverance has seen a number of dust devils and windstorms sweep through Jezero crater as a beautiful reminder of how environments are always changing, even on a dried-up planet like Mars.</p>

<p>“We often think of Mars as this barren wasteland where not much happens today,” Stack Morgan says. “But when you see these dust devils move across the images, you’re kind of reminded that Mars, even though not Earthlike, is its own very active planet still.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">With a powerful laser blast, scientists near a nuclear fusion milestone</a></h4>

              
                <p>With a powerful laser zap, scientists have blasted toward a milestone for nuclear fusion.</p>



<p>A fusion experiment at the world’s biggest laser facility released 1.3 million joules of energy, coming close to a break-even point known as ignition, where fusion begins to release more energy than required to detonate it. Reaching ignition would strengthen hopes that fusion could one day serve as a clean, plentiful energy source, a goal that scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-nuclear-fusion-still-hasnt-delivered-clean-energy">have struggled to make progress toward</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>By pummeling a tiny capsule with lasers at the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, scientists triggered fusion reactions that churned out more than 10 quadrillion watts of power over 100 trillionths of a second. In all, the experiment, performed August 8, released about 70 percent of the energy of the laser light used to set off the fusion reactions, putting the facility much closer to ignition than ever before.</p>



<p>Notably, because the capsule absorbs only a portion of the total laser energy focused on it, the reactions actually produced more energy than directly went into igniting them. “That, just fundamentally, is a truly amazing feat,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the research. By that metric, the fusion reactions produced about five times as much energy as was absorbed.</p>





<p>“It’s a really exciting result, and it wasn’t clear that NIF would be able to get to this result,” Kuranz says. For years, NIF scientists have strived to reach ignition, but they have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ignition-failed">plagued with setbacks</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/13</em>). While the new results have yet to be published in a scientific journal, NIF scientists went public with their discovery after word got out to the scientific community and excitement mounted.</p>



<p>“It makes me very hopeful … for fusion in the future,” Kuranz says.</p>



<p>Nuclear fusion, the same process that powers the sun, would be an appealing source of energy on Earth because it checks several boxes for environmental friendliness: It wouldn’t generate climate-warming greenhouse gases or dangerous, long-lived radioactive waste. In nuclear fusion, hydrogen nuclei meld together to form helium, releasing energy in the process. But fusion requires extreme temperatures and pressures, making it difficult to control.</p>



<p>NIF is not alone in the fusion quest. Other projects, such as ITER, an enormous facility under construction in southern France, are using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">different techniques to tackle the problem</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). But those efforts have also met with difficulties. Perhaps unsurprisingly, controlling reactions akin to those in the sun is challenging no matter how you go about it.</p>



<p>In NIF’s fusion experiments, 192&nbsp;laser beams converge on a small cylinder containing a peppercorn-sized fuel capsule. When that powerful laser burst hits the cylinder, X-rays stream out, vaporizing the capsule’s exterior and imploding the fuel within. That fuel is a mixture of deuterium and tritium, varieties of hydrogen that respectively contain one or two neutrons in their atomic nuclei. As the fuel implodes, it reaches the extreme densities, temperatures and pressures needed to fuse the hydrogen into helium. That helium can further heat the rest of the fuel, what’s known as alpha heating, setting off a fusion chain reaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of blue lasers blasting a fuel capsule" class="wp-image-3102720" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102720">In fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility, lasers (blue in this artist’s rendering) blast a tiny cylinder containing a fuel capsule (white sphere). That process produces X-rays that vaporize the capsule’s exterior and compresses the fuel to the extreme pressures and temperatures needed to drive fusion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102720">LLNL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That last step is crucial to boosting the energy yield. “What’s new about this experiment is that we’ve created a system in which the alpha heating rate is far larger than we’ve ever achieved before,” says NIF physicist Arthur Pak.</p>



<p>Scientists navigated a variety of quagmires to get to this stage. “There’s a whole host of physics issues … that we’ve faced off and mitigated,” Pak says. For example, researchers took pains to make the capsule absorb more energy, to eliminate tiny defects in the capsule and to carefully tune the laser pulses to maximize fusion.</p>



<p>In 2018, researchers began seeing the payoff of those efforts. NIF achieved a then-record fusion energy of 55,000 joules. Then, in spring 2021, NIF reached 170,000 joules. Further tweaking the design of the experiment, scientists suspected, could increase the output even more. But the new experiment went beyond expectations, producing nearly eight times the energy of the previous effort.</p>



<p>Further studies will help NIF scientists determine exactly how their changes created such bountiful energy and how to enhance the output further. Still, even if NIF achieves full-fledged ignition, using fusion to generate power for practical purposes is still a long way off. “There will be a huge amount of work needed to turn the technology into a viable source of energy,” says laser plasma physicist Stuart Mangles of Imperial College London, who was not involved with the research. “Nevertheless, this is a really important milestone on the way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-earthquake-citizen-science-seismology-risk">Haiti’s citizen seismologists helped track its devastating quake in real time</a></h4>

              
                <p>On August 14, a powerful magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti, triggering landslides, toppling buildings and killing at least 1,900 people, with over 9,000 people injured. Rescue workers are racing against time to find survivors in the rubble, hampered by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace that battered and flooded the country’s southern peninsula on August 16.</p>



<p>Scientists, too, are rushing to the region to learn what they can from the devastation the quake left behind, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the seismic hazards faced by the country.</p>



<p>The epicenter of the quake was near Petit Trou de Nippes, a town on Haiti’s southern peninsula about 125 kilometers west of Port-au-Prince. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone passes straight through that peninsula, marking where the Caribbean tectonic plate to the south grinds against the small Gonâve tectonic plate to the north. Scientists often eye this fault zone as the likely source when a deadly quake strikes Haiti, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-scramble-analyze-haiti-quake">the 2010 earthquake that killed at least 200,000 people</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/10</em>).</p>



<p>But several months after that quake, scientists discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-quake-reveals-previously-unknown-fault">its origin was on a previously unknown fault</a>, near but not part of the well-known Enriquillo zone (<em>SN: 8/11/10</em>). The fault was within a region of faults not mapped before, in part due to a dearth of seismometers in Haiti. Since then, researchers have worked to increase seismic measurements and understanding of the country’s seismic hazards, including through the creation of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.542654/full">a network of volunteer “citizen seismologists</a>.” Data <a href="https://ayiti.unice.fr/sismo-ayiti/">collected by those volunteers</a> have already proved invaluable to tracking the most recent quake and its aftershocks, says geologist Dominique Boisson of the University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince.</p>





<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Boisson and geophysicist Eric Calais of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris about what we know about the new earthquake, scientists’ rapid-response efforts to map its impacts and how citizen seismologists can help. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do we know about where exactly this earthquake occurred?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Just after an earthquake, we have preliminary results that give you a sense of where the epicenter was. But we don’t have precise information — was it on this fault or another fault? That’s why we are doing the measurements we are doing right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We should keep in mind what happened in 2010. Right after the earthquake, it was the same thing: The Enriquillo fault is the main feature there, it’s got to be that fault. Then the data started coming in, and it became more and more clear that it was not that fault that had ruptured. And in the end, it was demonstrated that it was a small, secondary fault nearby. From a geologic standpoint, that’s very common. A good example is the 1989 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/loma-prietas-long-distance-punch">Loma Prieta earthquake </a>&nbsp;[in California] — that was not caused by the San Andreas Fault, it was triggered by a fault right next to it (<em>SN: 4/21/90</em>).</p>



<p>So are we in this situation from the earthquake of last week? The jury is still out. [This quake] seems to be shallower than the 2010 earthquake, and there’s a gap of about 50 kilometers between [where that quake and the August 14 quake occurred].</p>



<p>A question that a lot of seismologists have is what about this gap — will there be an earthquake [there]? Well, probably, but when, we don’t know. But it’s going to be an area of intense research in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>What can we learn from the just-launched seismology fieldwork that researchers at the University of Haiti are doing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s essential after any earthquake anywhere to be able to go to the field as quickly as possible to make a scientific assessment, of course without putting the emergency response into any difficulty. What it involves in practice is sending people to the field with instruments like seismometers and geodetic instruments [such as GPS receivers that can provide 3-D coordinates].</p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Right now, with GPS, they are going to make a survey of the position of the ground, and where it was displaced. We are going to compare these measurements with measurements [from these areas] in the past, and we will track how this movement evolves in the next weeks and months. [We’re] also sending in teams to study landslides [triggered by the quake]. So there is a lot of work to do right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: In the case of this earthquake, it’s particularly difficult to reach the field, but we are glad to be able to report that two of the researchers are safe in the field … [and] are deploying instruments to better understand the mechanism of the earthquake. That will be very important to assess what might be coming next, and in particular to better understand what the aftershocks are telling us.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>How well are the faults of this area mapped? And how might measurements of microseisms — abundant tiny earthquakes difficult to distinguish from background noise — help to image Haiti’s subsurface?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: The big [Enriquillo] fault is well-known. But we are very far from having detailed maps of the active faults of the southern peninsula or other parts of the country. There’s a lot of work to be done to have a good map of the active faults and what is the real shape of the structures underneath.</p>



<p>With data on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-million-tiny-earthquakes-revealed-southern-california">microseisms</a>, including from citizen seismologists, it will be very helpful to get this kind of information for <a href="https://seismosoc.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/12/details/5621">imaging the structures in the subsurface</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>). Even though the data [from the citizen seismologists] is not of the same quality as the professional networks, it’s very important for helping to image the structures.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How important has the citizen seismology project been to tracking the recent earthquake and its aftershocks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It has been essential. It’s just amazing how proactive the seismic station hosts have been. We call them hosts, because they host a tiny little box, about 10 centimeters by 5 centimeters by 5 centimeters. And you just connect it to power and the internet, and it provides data in real time. And then we have built a system that analyzes the data in real time and provides aftershock locations. So within 30 seconds of an aftershock, we know exactly where it happened, what was the magnitude and the depth and so on.</p>

Calais</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How many citizen seismologists are working with you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We have 15 stations throughout the country, and in the epicenter area, we have six stations. And we’re deploying more as we speak. We have a new project that’s just been approved to augment the network with an additional 50 stations.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>So who are these volunteers? What are some of the challenges they face in doing this work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: Their backgrounds vary — we have a public notary, we have a hotel owner, we have a civil engineer. It’s all over the map really. It’s not easy to have internet and power available all the time in Haiti — there’s no place, almost, where that’s possible. So everybody has a power generator of some kind; you buy your internet plan by the day. We had one station, the station closest to the epicenter … the host was so sorry because he had not renewed his internet plan when the earthquake happened. And right away he contacted us and said, “Well, I just ran to the internet provider and I just bought a new plan!” And his station came back online right away.</p>



<p>So it’s an amazing effort. It shows that there is really an interesting bridge to build between citizens who want to participate and want to be informed, and scientists. The data are very, very useful to us, and the interaction we’re having with the hosts is teaching us a lot also about how the risk is perceived and what kind of message [about potential seismic hazards] is useful.</p>



<p>The message of a seismologist is a very technical one, and so how do we convey a message that is actionable, that makes sense to the people who receive it? We’re not trained for that, and we need to learn from our audience what they need.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>In 2020, you (Calais and Boisson) and your colleagues published a preliminary report on the citizen seismology project, calling it a socio-seismology experiment. How might this work improve earthquake awareness and potentially reduce risks from these hazards?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s a very interesting endeavor because it’s not only seismology that we’re interested in. It’s a project that we’re conducting with sociologists and anthropologists. The project is too young to be able to tell whether it has made any difference in the level of preparedness. But right now are we are trying to organize a team of sociologists to send into the field to interview people and build a baseline of information about how risk is perceived. We don’t have that. It’s a shame that we tend to send emergency response, seismologists and so on, [but] we don’t think so much about sending sociologists.</p>



<p>After the 2010 earthquake, which was really a dramatic experience for a lot of people, there was no baseline study that was done right after. So you come back 10 years later, and you can’t tell a difference between how the risk is perceived. So we’re trying to change that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">How extreme heat from climate change distorts human behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a sweltering summer afternoon almost a decade ago, Meenu Tewari was visiting a weaving company in Surat in western India. Tewari, an urban planner, frequently makes such visits to understand how manufacturing companies operate. On that day, though, her tour of the factory floor left her puzzled.</p>



<p>“There were no workers there … only machines,” says Tewari of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>



<p>The missing employees weren’t far away; they were resting in the shade under a nearby awning. Scorching temperatures had been causing workers to make mistakes or even faint near the dangerous machinery, Tewari’s guide told her. So the company had mandated that workers come in earlier and leave later so that they could rest during the midday heat.</p>



<p>Physiologically, people’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">bodies aren’t built to handle heat</a> beyond wet bulb temperatures — a combined measure of heat and humidity — of around 35° Celsius, or about 95° Fahrenheit (<em>SN: </em><em>5/8/20</em>). Mounting evidence shows that when heat taxes people’s bodies, their performance on various tasks, as well as overall coping mechanisms, also suffer. Researchers have linked extreme heat to increased aggression, lower cognitive ability and, as Tewari and colleagues showed, lost productivity.</p>



<p>With rising global temperatures, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">record-breaking heat waves</a> baking parts of the world, the effects of extreme heat on human behavior could pose a growing problem (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="454" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1.jpg" alt="tailors working at desks in Mumbai" class="wp-image-3102684" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-574x383.jpg 574w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102684">Factory workers in India, such as these tailors in Mumbai, must often work in buildings without air conditioning. When days get hot, productivity at such factories drops, research shows.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102684">Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And lower-income people and countries, with limited resources to keep cool as climate change warms the world, are likely to suffer the most, researchers say. &nbsp;“The physiological effects of heat may be universal, but the way it manifests … is highly unequal,” says economist R. Jisung Park of UCLA.</p>



<h4>Heat and aggression</h4>





<p>Scientists have been documenting humans’ difficulties coping with extreme heat for over a century. Much of that work, however, has taken place in laboratory settings to allow for a high degree of control.</p>



<p>For instance, a few decades ago, social psychologist Craig Anderson and colleagues showed undergraduates four video clips of couples engaged in dialog. One clip was neutral in tone, while the remaining three showed escalating tension between the duo. The undergraduate students watching the clips were each sitting in a room with the thermostat set to one of five different temperatures, ranging from a cool 14° C to a hot 36° C. The researchers then asked the students to score the couples’ hostility level. Anderson, now of Iowa State University in Ames, found that students in uncomfortably warm rooms scored all the couples, even the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260100800040">neutral one, as more hostile</a> than students in rooms with comfortable temperatures did. (Interestingly, students in uncomfortably cold rooms also scored the couples as more hostile.)</p>



<p>Heat tends to make people more irritable, says Anderson, whose findings appeared in the 2000 <em>Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. </em>And as a result, “they tend to just perceive things as being more nasty when they’re hot than when they’re comfortable.”</p>



<p>Research suggests that such perceptions can give way to actual violence when people lack an escape hatch. But this “heat-aggression hypothesis” has been hard to demonstrate outside the lab because teasing out the effect of heat from other environmental or biological variables linked to aggression is tricky in the messy real world. Studies in the last few years, however, have started confirming the idea. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Fueling crime</h3>



<p>Researchers have long known that people can become more aggressive when overheated. A new study looking at crime data in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2017 shows that violent crime rises when temperatures exceed a pleasant 65° to 70° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>For instance, a July working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research came close to re-creating the level of control found in a lab by focusing on inmates in Mississippi prisons and jails that lack air conditioning. Economists Anita Mukherjee of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Nicholas Sanders of Cornell University looked at rates of violence across 36 correctional facilities from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. Overall, each facility averaged about 65 violent acts per year. But the pair found that on days above around 27° C — which occur about just over 60 days per year — the probability of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28987">violence among inmates rose 18 percent</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t seem that hot, most of those days of had an average maximum temperature of roughly 34° C; nor do those temperature readings account for Mississippi’s high humidity, Mukherjee says. Moreover, many of the country’s aging correctional facilities lack both air conditioning and proper ventilation, and temperatures inside the facilities often exceed temperatures outside.</p>



<p>Politicians often frame providing inmates with air conditioning as a matter of comfort, Mukherjee says. “When we’re talking 120-plus degrees [Fahrenheit] inside a prison for many days a year, it becomes a moral issue.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating from the Mississippi data, Mukherjee and Sanders estimate that heat generates an additional 4,000 violent acts each year in U.S. correctional facilities.</p>



<p>Research also suggests that violence spikes alongside heat outside of prisons. For instance, for the months May to September from 2010 to 2017, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727272100044X">violent crime in Los Angeles was about 5.5 percent higher</a> on days with temperatures from about 24° C to 32° C (75° to 89° F), compared with days below those temperatures, researchers reported in the May <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>. Violent crime was almost 10 percent higher on even hotter days, the researchers found.</p>



<h4>Heat and performance</h4>



<p>The relationship between heat and human behavior extends well beyond violence. Consider students taking exams in hot school buildings. Park, the UCLA economist, zoomed in on students in New York City sitting for standardized subject-specific high school exams. Each take about three hours and are administered at the student’s home school for a two-week period at the end of June. Temperatures at that time can vary from 15° C to almost 37° C.</p>



<p>Park looked at scores for almost 1 million students and about 4.5 million exams from 1999 to 2011. That analysis, appearing March 2020 in the <em>Journal of Human Resources, </em>found that students who take the exam on an approximately 32° C day are <a href="http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/03/03/jhr.57.2.0618-9535R3">10 percent less likely to pass</a> a given subject than if they had taken that exam on a 24° C day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Park and colleagues also looked at how hot temperatures might affect students’ performance across the country. This time, they zoomed in on the PSAT, a standardized exam administered to high schoolers in October that measures college readiness and provides a pathway to scholarships. The team evaluated 21 million scores from nearly 10 million students who took the exam at least twice from 1998 to 2012. That way, the researchers could compare how students performed relative to themselves. The team also correlated exam scores with daily temperature data from around 3,000 weather stations across the country, as well as information about each student’s access to air conditioning.</p>



<p>Student scores typically increase between the first time they take the exam and the second. But even when the researchers factored in that rise, students in schools without air conditioning scored lower than would have been expected, the researchers reported in the May 2020 <em>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</em>. What’s more, Black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend school and test in hotter buildings than their white counterparts, and the researchers estimate that the resulting temperature differences <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fpol.20180612">explained 3 to 7 percent of the PSAT’s racial achievement gap.</a></p>



<p>That sort of performance decline doesn’t just happen in academic settings; it extends to the workforce too. Following Tewari’s visit to the weaving factory in Surat, she began combing through data on worker output in India — where industrial air conditioning can be rare — at several weaving and garment sewing factories and a steel company that supplies rails for railways.</p>



<p>Tewari and colleagues observed workers from roughly one to nine years, depending on the industry. When temperatures climbed beyond 35° C,&nbsp;average&nbsp;daily production in weaving dropped by about 2 percent and garment sewing by as much as 8 percent, compared with days under 30° C, the researchers estimate in the June <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>.</p>



<p>The team then scaled up to industries across India using national survey data. That analysis showed that productivity started dropping when average daily maximum temperatures rose above 20° C. The researchers’ calculations suggest that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713733">average annual output will decrease by 2.1 percent if average daily temperatures warm by 1 degree C</a> over current conditions; annual gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced in a single year, would drop by 3 percent.</p>



<p>The takeaway: Extreme heat hurts some countries’ bottom line, Tewari says.</p>





<h4>Universal air conditioning?</h4>



<p>The burdens of high heat are often borne by a country’s poorest residents. For instance, in the United States, a long legacy of discriminatory housing policies means poor people often live in the hottest parts of a city, a July report from Climate Central, an independent climate science research and communications organization, notes. In these concentrated pockets of heat, called “urban heat islands, <a href="https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/uploads/general/2021_UHI_Report.pdf">midafternoon temperatures can rise by 8° to 11° C</a> above outlying areas. The effects tend to be worse in poor neighborhoods due to high density, limited green space and shade and an abundance of paved roads and surfaces that absorb rather than reflect heat.</p>



<p>Similarly, in that study linking intense heat to violent crime spikes in Los Angeles, researchers found strong geographic differences. “Beverly Hills doesn’t have much violent crime on any of those days. But in the poorest communities in Los Angeles, you see a larger correlation between heat and violence,” says environmental economist Matthew Kahn of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Compared with wealthier city residents, poor people in Los Angeles have less space and far fewer air conditioning units, Kahn adds.</p>



<p>Given these inequities, the simplest choice is to provide everyone with air conditioning, Kahn says. But cooling buildings is far from free. Cooling equipment, including primarily air conditioners, accounted for about <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33094/CoolRep.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">17 percent of the world’s total electricity demand</a> in 2018, according to a 2020 United Nations report. Estimates suggest that air conditioning use in emerging economies alone will lead to 33 times as much energy consumption by the year 2100. And, at the moment, most of that energy comes from nonrenewable sources, chiefly oil, coal and gas, so meeting that demand would contribute to global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The choice over whether or not to install an air conditioning unit in a given facility, as with many things, comes down to relative costs and benefits, Tewari says. Even with soaring temperatures, air conditioning entire factories remains more expensive than giving workers midday siestas or selectively air conditioning only those rooms where precision is most required.</p>



<p>Moreover, better cooling options exist, say Tewari and others, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">maintaining or increasing tree cover in cities and using “cool” building materials</a> that reflect sunlight (<em>SN: </em><em>4/3/18</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Air conditioning is not sustainable,” Tewari says. “There are urban planning mechanisms through which you can reduce ambient temperatures.”</p>



<p>But Kahn says poor people deserve access to air conditioning. The long-term solution is not to keep overheating the poor, but to expedite efforts to green the energy grid, he says. “The poor have the least capacity to adapt. In a fair society, I hope we don’t just shrug at that fact.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/space-iconic-landmarks-mexico-city-google-office-03-21-2014/">ball pits</a> to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f23e63b-8768-441d-abc7-68e27ca6feed">free beers</a>, fun job perks have received plenty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/19/working-for-tech-companies-quirks-of-the-job?CMP=twt_gu">press attention</a> over the last few years. For millennials, such benefits should surely be appealing — they are, after all, the generation these perks were ostensibly designed for.</p>



<p>But according to a new study, young people themselves have a different priority in the workplace — respect. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23294884211016529">Writing in the <em>International Journal of Business Communication</em></a>, a team led by Danielle LaGree from Kansas State University finds that being valued and respected by managers was the key factor in employees’ ability to positively adapt to the workplace. And, in turn, this impacted how loyal workers were to their employers, how much they engaged in their work, and how happy they felt overall.</p>



<span id="more-43238"></span>



<p>Participants were 1,036 adults aged 21 to 34, all of whom were in full time employment. First, participants answered questions about “respectful engagement” at their workplaces — the extent to which colleagues express appreciation and respect for each other’s work, emphasise each other’s good qualities, and speak to each other in a respectful way. Next, they completed a measure of how they felt they were judged by bosses or supervisors, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “my boss values what I contribute to work” and “my boss appreciates my unique contributions to the job”.</p>



<p>Occupational resilience was measured next, with participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements related to the way they handle setbacks at work, as well as how satisfied they felt at work in general. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to remain at their current company in the future, and how engaged they were at work, responding to statements including “I strive as hard as I can to complete my job”, “I feel positive about my job” and “I pay a lot of attention to my job”.</p>



<p>Those who felt they were respected and valued both by colleagues and by bosses were more likely to experience occupational resilience — that is, they were more able to deal with the challenges of the workplace. In turn, greater occupational resilience led these people to say they were more likely to want to stay employed at their company, and more willing to engage with their roles.</p>



<p>There was no difference by gender or ethnicity of participants, though there were different outcomes based on field: those working in computing reported significantly more respectful engagement at work than those working in retail, healthcare, education or sales.</p>



<p>Together, the results show that having supportive colleagues and supervisors can increase employees’ job satisfaction and engagement, and make them more likely to retain their position — and it seems that this is because a supportive environment creates employees who are able to deal with the trials and tribulations of the workplace. The team suggests that these findings could be a useful tool — training bosses in particular how to communicate respectfully, for example, could make for happier, more satisfied workplaces with employees who are unlikely to seek new work.</p>



<p>Looking explicitly at other perks and benefits could provide additional insight. To what degree do perks mitigate disrespectful workplaces, if at all? Overall, however, the results suggest that workplace happiness is mostly dependent on fundamental principles of respect and appreciation. They, more than free beers or ball pits, are likely to define employees’ experiences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildflower-carnivore-plant-sticky-hair-insect-trap">A well-known wildflower turns out to be a secret carnivore</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gleaming, gluey, deathtrap hairs have betrayed the secret identity of a well-known wildflower: It’s a carnivore.</p>



<p>A species of false asphodel (<em>Triantha occidentalis</em>) uses enzyme-secreting hairs on its flowering stem to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2022724118">snare and digest insects</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 17 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Scientists have known about<em> T. occidentalis</em> since the 19th century, but its taste for meat has gone undetected until now.</p>



<p>Sticky hairs by themselves aren’t unusual — many noncarnivorous plants use them to defend against pests<em>. </em>But <em>T. occidentalis</em> has qualities that some meat-eating plants share: a love of bright, boggy, nutrient-poor habitats and the absence of a gene that fine-tunes how plants get energy from light. Together, those features felt like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle hinting at carnivory, says botanist Sean Graham of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>To solve the puzzle, Graham and colleagues needed to know if the wildflower pulls nutrients from insect corpses. Luckily, <em>T. occidentalis</em> grows along North America’s West Coast, from Alaska to California, and can be found on hikes near Vancouver. “They’re right on our doorstep,” Graham says.</p>

<p>The team attached fruit flies fed with nitrogen-15, an isotope that can be used to track changes in nitrogen levels, to the flowering stems of bog-dwelling <em>T. occidentalis</em> plants in British Columbia’s Cypress Provincial Park. Over half of the wildflowers’ nitrogen came from the fruit flies, the team found. Those levels are comparable to known carnivorous plants. What’s more, the wildflowers’ sticky hairs oozed phosphatase, a digestive enzyme that many carnivorous plants secrete to consume prey.</p>



<p>Most of the world’s roughly 800 meat-eating plant species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/pollinators-venus-flytrap-plants">set traps and flowers far apart</a> to avoid killing pollinating visitors (<em>SN: 2/6/18</em>). <em>T. occidentalis</em> bucks that trend. “Putting your traps close to your flowers is, on the surface, a really big conflict,” Graham says. But the plant’s hairs may be just sticky enough to catch small flies and beetles without entrapping bigger pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>



<p><em>T. occidentalis’</em> sticky hairs might also hint at how some meat-eating plants evolved. In nutrient-poor soils, it may have been advantageous for some plants to co-opt hairs for carnivory, Graham says. “The insects are being trapped anyway, so might as well use them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">New studies hint that the coronavirus may be evolving to become more airborne</a></h4>

              
                <p>Small aerosol particles spewed while people breathe, talk and sing may contain more coronavirus than larger moisture droplets do. And the coronavirus may be evolving to spread more easily through the air, a new study suggests. But there is also good news: Masks can help.</p>



<p>About 85 percent of coronavirus RNA detected in COVID-19 patients’ breath <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab691/6343417">was found in fine aerosol particles</a> less than five micrometers in size, researchers in Singapore report August 6 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. The finding is the latest evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is spread mainly through the air in fine droplets that may stay suspended for hours rather than in larger droplets that quickly fall to the ground and contaminate surfaces.</p>



<p>Similar to that result, Donald Milton at the University of Maryland in College Park and colleagues found that people who carried the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.21261989v1">alpha variant had 18 times as much viral RNA in aerosols</a> than people infected with less-contagious versions of the virus. That study, posted August 13 at medRxiv.org, has not been yet been peer reviewed. It also found that loose-fitting masks could cut the amount of virus-carrying aerosols by nearly half.</p>

<p>In one experiment, the Maryland team grew the virus from the air samples in the lab. That could be evidence that may convince some reluctant experts to embrace the idea that the virus spreads mainly through the air.</p>



<p>The debate over aerosol transmission has been ongoing since nearly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">200 scientists wrote a letter to the World Health Organization</a> asking for the organization to acknowledge aerosol spread of the virus (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>). In April, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">WHO upgraded its information</a> on transmission to include aerosols (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had acknowledged aerosols as the most likely source of spread just a few weeks before.</p>



<p>Previous studies in monkeys have also suggested that more virus ends up in aerosols than in large droplets. But some experts say that direct evidence that the virus spreads mainly through the air is still lacking.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of indirect evidence that the airborne route — breathing it in — is dominant,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, who studies viruses in the air. She was one of the 200 scientists who wrote to the WHO last year. “‘Airborne’ is a loaded word in infection control circles,” she says, requiring health care workers to isolate patients in special rooms, wear protective equipment and take other costly and resource-intensive measures to stop the spread of the disease. For those reasons, infection control experts have been reluctant to call the coronavirus airborne without especially strong proof.</p>



<p>Most COVID-19 cases have been among close household contacts — typically within the 6-feet splash zone of large droplets. It can be hard to tease out whether such infections were passed on by large droplet contamination or by breathing the same air. But for other situations, such as when patrons get infected while sitting across a restaurant from someone with COVID-19, aerosols are really the only explanation, Marr says.</p>



<p>Mechanical engineer Kwok Wai Tham of the National University of Singapore set out to sample how much virus COVID-19 patients produce when they breathe, talk or sing, in part, to address skeptics’ concerns. “I’m doing this to convince some very close friends,” he says. He and colleagues rolled a mobile lab into 22 patients’ rooms and had volunteers stick their heads into a large metal cone.</p>





<p>The researchers collected both aerosols and larger droplets that the patients exhaled while breathing quietly for 30 minutes, while repeating passages from Dr. Seuss’ <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> for 15 minutes, or while singing simple tunes like the “Happy Birthday” song, “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” or the “ABCs” for 15 minutes. The scientists tested both aerosols and large droplets in the air samples for coronavirus RNA and calculated how many copies of the virus’s nucleocapsid protein gene, or N gene, were present. That gives an estimate of how much virus is in a sample.</p>



<p>Of the 22 patients who sang for science, only 13 spewed forth detectable levels of viral RNA. In general, singing created the most virus-laden aerosols, but some people generated more while talking. Those differences might be attributable to the volume at which volunteers sang, Tham says. “Some people were shy and sang softer. Others were quite uninhibited.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The overall amount of virus that people produced varied widely. Scientists already knew that some people are more likely to spread the virus than others, including some people involved in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">superspreading events</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 6/18/20</em>). In this new study, the differences weren’t due to symptoms — some asymptomatic people made more virus than those with fevers, coughs or runny noses.</p>



<p>Only one factor stood out as affecting the amount of virus emitted. People who were earlier in the course of infection tended to produce more virus, the researchers found. That agrees with data from lab animal studies and other human studies suggesting that people are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">most contagious in the first week</a> after catching the coronavirus (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>So far, Tham’s skeptical virologist friends aren’t convinced that he’s demonstrated that aerosol transmission is the major route of COVID-19 spread. “They say, ‘we need the golden evidence. Show me a live virus that is retrieved from the air,’” Tham says.</p>



<p>Viral RNA could be debris from dead viruses that can’t cause infection, says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in either study. “In the absence of infectious virus, the significance of aerosols on transmission is still a bit unclear.”</p>

<p>The study from the Maryland group may provide that evidence. In that study, people with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus cases recited the ABCs, shouted “Go Terps!” (the Maryland mascot) or sang “Happy Birthday” into a similar device. In this study, the infected people did the activities once while wearing a mask and once while not wearing one.</p>



<p>About 45 percent of fine aerosol particles contained viral RNA, as did 31 percent of coarse aerosols larger than 5 micrometers and 65 percent of droplets called fomites collected from swabs of the volunteers’ mobile phones, the researchers found.</p>



<p>In addition, the increased amount of alpha variant in aerosols may suggest that the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient airborne spread, the researchers propose. The study was done from May 2020 to April 2021, before the delta variant began its surge in the United States.</p>



<p>Researchers were able to grow infectious virus from two of 66 aerosol samples, both collected while people were wearing masks. None of the coarse aerosols or fomites yielded any infectious virus.</p>



<p>Although the Maryland group used an efficient way to look for infectious virus in aerosols, it was still rare to find them, Pekosz says. “It would be difficult to make the case that this was what is responsible for increased spread of alpha.”</p>



<p>But Marr says the data do suggest the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient spread through the air. Although the study involved only four patients infected with alpha, those people consistently released more virus than people infected with other variants. “These results combined with epidemiological observations about the spread of alpha, and now delta, support the idea that these variants are supercharged when it comes to aerosol transmission,” she says.</p>



<p>The masks volunteers wore in the Maryland study were mostly loose-fitting. They ranged from a single-layer homemade cloth mask early on and progressed over the course of the study to double-layer commercially made cloth masks, to double masks, surgical masks and one KN95 mask by the end. On average, the masks reduced the number of virus-containing, coarse aerosols produced by 77 percent compared with no mask. And virus-laden fine aerosols were reduced an average of 48 percent, though the reduction ranged from 3 percent to 72 percent. Masks performed equally well against the alpha variant as for other variants. &nbsp;Previous studies have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks — ones that seal tightly to the face and don’t leave gaps at the tops, bottoms or sides for the virus to pass unfiltered — may reduce coronavirus exposure by 96 percent</a> if everyone is wearing them (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The latest results suggest that masks can help reduce the amount of virus people give off, though the coronavirus can still escape if the face coverings are worn loosely. “With the dominance of newer, more contagious variants than those we studied, increased attention to improved ventilation, filtration, air sanitation, and use of high-quality tight-fitting face masks or respirators … will be increasingly important for controlling the pandemic,” the researchers wrote. That’s especially important in places with low vaccination rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Sunbirds’ dazzling feathers are hot, in both senses of the word</a></h4>

              
                <p>For sunbirds, all that shimmers is piping hot.</p>



<p>The birds’ flashy, iridescent feathers heat up more than other types of feathers, possibly making it harder to stay cool in hot, sunny conditions. If so, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0252">the colorful plumes may be costly ornaments for luring mates</a>, researchers report August 4 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. </p>



<p>Many studies on the thermal properties of animal color have previously focused on differences between how dark and light colors derived from pigments react to light and heat, says Svana Rogalla, a biophysicist at the Biofisika Institute in Bilbao, Spain. Less attention has been paid to how heat interacts with structural color — often vibrant, iridescent hues created by light refracting off of microscopic structures. These structures are found in everything from the scales of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-worms-elvis-species">deep-sea worms</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>5/25/20</em>) to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-structures-give-peacock-spider-its-radiant-rump">spiders</a>’ exoskeletons (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/9/16</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Rogalla and colleagues turned to sunbirds, nectar-feeding birds typically smaller than sparrows that are native to Africa, Asia and Australia. Sunbirds have feather colors that come from a mix of sources, including pigments like fiery carotenoids and dark melanin as well as iridescent structural color.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The researchers examined 15 sunbird species preserved at the Field Museum in Chicago, heating the specimens under a lamp that mimics sunlight and then measuring the surface temperatures of feathers and the preserved birds’ skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iridescent feathers heated up more than feathers that had only pigment-based colors, the team found. In breast feathers, for example, iridescent feathers averaged about 74° Celsius at the feather surface after a few minutes of light exposure, where feathers with yellow to red carotenoid pigments reached just over 63° C. This heat transferred to the skin, too, with skin under iridescent feathers growing about 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C hotter than skin under feathers with olive or yellow to red pigments.</p>



<p>Light scattering off of microscopic layers of air, the protein keratin and melanin-containing structures called melanosomes creates iridescent feathers’ sheen. But the plentiful melanin also makes the feathers absorb more solar radiation than other lighter-colored, less melanin-rich feathers, Rogalla says, which contributes to heating.</p>



<p>What’s more, high-powered microscopes and heat simulations showed that melanosomes’ arrangement in an iridescent feather⁠ encourages heat absorption. Melanosomes in a dark, noniridescent feather sit relatively disorganized in layers. But the melanosomes in the stacked, microscopic structures that produce iridescence are more organized and densely packed. Iridescent feathers likely heat up more than black feathers because those shimmering plumes have more melanosomes over a given feather area, Rogalla says.</p>



<p>The shape of the melanosomes may make a difference too. Iridescent feathers tend to have plate-shaped melanosomes, with rod-shaped ones in black feathers and spherical ones in gray feathers. The team’s simulations showed plate-shaped melanosomes heating up more than the other two shapes.</p>

Those feathers absorb more light than other feather types, possibly making it harder to stay cool.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102575">Svana Rogalla</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Iridescence is more pronounced in male sunbirds than females and is used in courtship displays. Rogalla wonders if the flashy colors, by possibly contributing to heat stress, create an evolutionary conflict between mating and staying cool, or thermoregulating. “It could be a trade-off,” she says, “being very colorful to attract females, but then you have a cost when you sit in the sun when it’s hot.”</p>



<p>Allison Shultz, an ornithologist at the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County in California who was not involved with this research, says the flashy plumage may act as a signal demonstrating a male bird’s relative vigor and resilience.&nbsp;“Maybe it shows [females] that males are able to deal with this higher heat load by having iridescent colors.”</p>



<p>Still, there’s a big caveat to the experimental setup. The study’s results may be “difficult to put in perspective” because the experiments were conducted on dead birds, says Vinod Kumar Saranathan, an evolutionary biologist at Yale-NUS College in Singapore.&nbsp;“You don’t have the benefit of the live bird [to evaluate], manipulating its body and doing various things to actively thermoregulate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunbirds can release heat by panting or changing feather positions. And the birds rarely stay in the sun for long, Saranathan says, explaining that they dart from flowers in sunny areas to more shaded forest. If iridescent feathers lose heat as quickly as they acquire it, the sunbirds could use shade to cool off, blunting the effect of the hot plumage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Iridescence has evolved so many times independently across the [bird evolutionary tree],” Saranathan says. If shiny feathers were particularly burdensome to birds, he says, that repeated evolution wouldn’t be likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the findings have implications for how iridescence could contribute to heat effects from climate change. Rogalla points out that small birds like sunbirds — vulnerable to big swings in ambient temperatures — have already perished en masse from extreme heat events. Such instances of mass death have occurred among Australian parrots, for example, where intense heat waves have killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/heatwave-kills-hundreds-of-birds-in-wa-20090113-7g1f.html">hundreds of budgerigars</a> and scores of <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/PC110141">cockatoos</a> in recent years. With their hot feathers, iridescent sunbirds may be especially at risk.</p>



<p>A warming climate may force iridescent birds to be active for shorter amounts of time during hot days to avoid the additive impact of solar heating, Saranathan says.&nbsp;If so, he adds, such a truncated schedule may increase competition for food in the precious remaining active hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262046121">Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</a><br><em>Ashley Jean Yeager</em><br><em>MIT Press, $24.95</em></p>



<p>Vera Rubin’s research forced cosmologists to radically reimagine the cosmos.</p>



<p>In the 1960s and ’70s, Rubin’s observations of stars whirling around within galaxies revealed the gravitational tug of invisible “dark matter.” Although astronomers had detected hints of this enigmatic substance for decades, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Rubin’s data helped finally convince</a> a skeptical scientific community that dark matter exists (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>“Her work was pivotal to redefining the composition of our cosmos,” Ashley Yeager, <em>Science News</em>’ associate news editor, writes in her new book. <em>Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</em> follows Rubin’s journey from stargazing child to preeminent astronomer and fierce advocate for women in science.</p>





<p>That journey, Yeager shows, was rife with obstacles. When Rubin was a young astronomer in the 1950s and ’60s, many observatories were closed to women, and more established scientists often brushed her off. Much of her early work was met with intense skepticism, but that only made Rubin, who died in 2016 at age 88, a more dogged data collector.</p>





<p>On graphs plotting the speeds of stars swirling around galaxies, Rubin showed that stars farther from galactic centers orbited just as fast as inner stars. That is, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">the galaxies’ rotation curves were flat</a>. Such speedy outer stars must be pulled along by the gravitational grip of dark matter.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>staff writer Maria Temming spoke with Yeager about Rubin’s legacy and what, beyond her pioneering research, made Rubin remarkable. The following discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What inspired you to tell Rubin’s story?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>It all started when I was working at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2007. I was walking around the “Explore the Universe” exhibit and noticed there weren’t many women featured. But then there was this picture of a woman with big glasses and cropped hair, and I thought, “Who is this?” It was Vera Rubin.</p>



<p>My supervisor was a curator of oral histories. He was working on Rubin’s, so I asked him about her. He said, “I have one more oral history interview to do with her. Would you like to come?” So I got to interview her. She was charismatic, kind and curious — not a person who was all about herself, but wanted to know about you. That stuck with me.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: You spend much of the book describing evidence for dark matter besides Rubin’s research. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I wanted to make sure I didn’t portray Rubin as this lone person who discovered dark matter, because there were a lot of different moving pieces in astronomy and physics that came together in the ’70s and early ’80s for the scientific community to say, “OK, we really have to take dark matter seriously.”</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What made Rubin’s work a linchpin for confirming dark matter?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She really went after nailing down that flat rotation curve in all types of galaxies. Mainly because she did get a lot of pushback, continually, that said, “Oh, that’s just a special case in that galaxy, or that’s just for those types of galaxies.” She studied hundreds of galaxies to double-check that, yes, in fact, the rotation curves are flat. People saying, “We don’t believe you,” didn’t ever really knock her down. She just came back swinging harder.</p>



<p>It helped that she did the work in visible wavelengths of light. There had been a lot of radio astronomy data to suggest flat rotation curves, but because radio astronomy was very new, it was really only once you saw it with the eye that the astronomy community was convinced.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Do you have a favorite anecdote about Rubin?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>The one that comes to mind is how much she loved flowers. She told me about how on drives from Lowell Observatory to Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, she and her colleague Kent Ford would always stop and buy wildflowers. The fact that picking these wildflowers stuck with her, I thought, was just representative of who she was. Her favorite moments weren’t necessarily these big discoveries she’d made, but stopping to pick some flowers and enjoy their beauty.</p>

<p><strong>Temming: Did you learn anything in your research that surprised you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I didn’t initially grasp how many different types of projects she had. She did a lot with looking for larger-scale structure [in the universe] and looking at the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-bursts-universe-expansion-hubble-constant">Hubble constant</a> [which describes how fast the universe is expanding] (<em>SN: 4/21/21</em>). She had a very diverse set of questions that she wanted to answer, well into her 70s.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: I was surprised by her decision to get out of the rat-race of hunting for quasars, when that area of research heated up in the 1960s.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She very much didn’t like to be in pressure situations where she could be wrong. She liked to go and collect so much data that no one could [dispute it]. With quasar research, it was just too fast, and she wanted to be methodical about it.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Why is Rubin’s story important to tell now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>Unfortunately for women and minorities in science, it’s still very relevant, in that there are a lot of challenges to pursuing a career in STEM. Her story demonstrates that you have to surround yourself with people who are willing to help you and get away from the people who want to keep you down. Plus her story is also very encouraging: Your curiosity can keep you going and can fuel something way bigger than yourself.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How did she advocate for women in astronomy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was very outspoken about it. At National Academy of Sciences meetings, the organizers always dreaded her standing up, because she would say, “What are we doing about women in science? We’re not doing enough.” She was constantly pushing for women to be recognized with awards. She kept tabs on the number of women who had earned Ph.D.s and who had gotten staff positions — and their salaries. She was very data-driven. She’d cull that information and use it to advocate for better representation and recognition of women in astronomy.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How would you describe Rubin to someone who hasn’t met her?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was one of the most persistent, gracious and nurturing people that I’ve ever met. You could strip away all that she did in astronomy and she would still be this incredible figure — the way she carried herself, the way she treated people. Just a beautiful human being.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>No one likes the sound of someone else chewing or drinking. But for some people, it’s enough to cause overwhelming feelings of anger or disgust — and in some cases, send them into a violent rage. People with &#8220;misophonia&#8221; (literally a hatred of sounds) over-react to some common everyday &#8220;trigger sounds&#8221; — typically, sounds made by another person. Though the <a href="https://allergictosound.com">phenomenon has been well documented</a>, exactly what causes it hasn’t been clear. Now a <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/41/26/5762.full.pdf">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> provides a compelling explanation: that misophonia isn’t related to hearing so much as to an &#8220;over-mirroring&#8221; of someone else’s physical actions. The team, led by Sukhbinder Kumar at Newcastle University, thinks that this excessive mirroring causes anger in some sufferers, and anxiety and distress in others.</p>



<span id="more-43233"></span>



<p>So-called &#8220;mirror neurons&#8221; in the premotor cortex were first discovered in monkeys. Groups of these neurons fire when a monkey either performs a specific action, like opening a peanut shell, or watches another monkey doing the same action. This system is thought to aid learning from others, and also the coordination of actions, so that a troop can hunt together effectively, for example. In people, there is evidence for mirror systems for movement and also emotion. (I should note, though, that some researchers <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/25/there-is-only-weak-evidence-that-mirror-neurons-underlie-human-empathy-new-review-and-meta-analysis/">dispute the strength of this evidence</a>.)</p>



<p>Misophonia has been thought of as a disorder of sound emotion processing — that sufferers over-react emotionally to trigger sounds. However, Kumar and his colleagues observed that most trigger sounds involve physical movements of the mouth and face. They wondered whether this might be important for understanding the disorder.</p>



<p>The team used fMRI to look at activity in the brains of 33 people with and without misophonia while they were in a &#8220;resting state&#8221; — when they were not actively engaged in doing anything in particular. They also analysed existing fMRI data on 42 people with and without misophonia while they listened to three categories of sounds: known trigger sounds (including gulping, slurping, eating food and sniffing); other generally unpleasant sounds (such as the sound of a baby crying or a dentist’s drill); and neutral sounds (like rain or a helicopter).</p>



<p>A number of intriguing differences emerged between sufferers vs non-sufferers. While in a resting state, people with misophonia showed stronger functional connectivity between the auditory and visual cortex and the ventral premotor cortex (functional connectivity is a measure of how closely correlated brain activity is in different regions). This latter region includes the orofacial motor area, which is responsible for movements of the face and mouth region. While listening to sounds of any kind, people with misophonia also showed stronger connectivity between the auditory cortex and the orofacial motor area. Finally, in response to known trigger sounds, they showed stronger activation of the orofacial motor area.</p>



<p>The fact that the misophonia group showed differences specifically involving facial motor regions points to misophonia being caused by aberrations in the motor mirror system — by excessive mirroring of someone else’s facial movements — rather than abnormal sound processing, per se. “Our results support a model of misophonia based on ‘hyper-mirroring’ of the orofacial actions of others with sounds being the ‘medium’ via which action of others is excessively mirrored,” the team explains.</p>



<p>It’s a fascinating idea. And it sits neatly with other work on different kinds of hyper-mirroring, such as &#8220;<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/20/whats-different-about-the-brains-of-the-minority-of-us-who-feel-other-peoples-physical-pain/">mirror pain</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://banissylab.com/mirror-touch/">mirror touch</a>&#8220;. However, people with these conditions <em>feel </em>at least some pain or touch when they see someone else being hurt or being touched, and these experiences don’t tend to make them angry. Why would hyper-mirroring of someone else’s mouth movements make misophonia sufferers so distressed, or induce rage?</p>



<p>The team suggests that if they’re not aware of what’s actually going on (and mirror pain would be a lot more noticeable than facial movement mirroring), someone with misophonia could experience a sense of a loss of control over their own actions and goals. “Since anger can be described as perceived goal interference, the drive to imitate others would make anger (or aggression) the dominating emotional response,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Clearly, there&#8217;s more to explore here. But this new conception of misophonia could have immediate practical impacts. For some sufferers and their families, misophonia is a very serious problem. It can lead to social isolation and even suicide. If sufferers could be trained to associate trigger sounds with the sound sources rather than orofacial movements specifically, perhaps this might work as an effective treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-grave-finland-warrior-nonbinary-person-gender">A 1,000-year-old grave may have held a powerful nonbinary person</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, a roughly 1,000-year-old grave in southern Finland has been thought to have held a powerful woman who might have been a warrior. But an individual who was biologically male may have actually been interred there, researchers now say. And there are signs that this person was perhaps a respected individual with a nontraditional gender identity.</p>



<p>Discovered in 1968 at a site known as Suontaka, the Finnish grave held a largely decomposed human skeleton. Only two leg-bone fragments were successfully excavated. The grave also included jewelry traditionally associated with women and two swords, including one with a bronze hilt, typically attributed to men. Items in the Suontaka grave date to the latter part of Finland’s early medieval period, between 1050 and 1300.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of a tiny amount of nuclear DNA extracted from a leg-bone fragment suggests that the grave held an individual born with an extra X chromosome, say archaeologist Ulla Moilanen of the University of Turku in Finland and colleagues. Symptoms of this condition in present-day males, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949">Klinefelter syndrome</a>, include low testosterone, lack of facial and body hair, enlarged breasts and learning and language-related problems. Effects of this rare condition on growth and appearance range from mild to noticeable.</p>



<p>That genetic evidence, combined with the unusual mix of male- and female-related items in the grave, suggests that the grave held an individual who was nonbinary, Moilanen’s group says. Gender identity refers to a person’s concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither. It often, but not always, coincides with a person’s biological sex. Nonbinary individuals have gender identities that are not strictly male or female.</p>





<p>Even in early medieval societies that emphasized masculinity and warfare, some individuals who didn’t fit community expectations about how males and females should behave may have been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/woman-with-a-sword-weapon-grave-at-suontaka-vesitorninmaki-finland/33A89DB1D7E4900F017833D87C997D3D">interred in ways that commemorated their nontraditional social gender identities</a>, the scientists conclude July 15 in the <em>European Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>“This burial [at Suontaka] has an unusual and strong mixture of feminine and masculine symbolism, and this might indicate that the individual was not strictly associated with either gender but instead with something else,” Moilanen says.</p>



<p>The nature of that alternative gender identity remains a mystery. Further complicating matters, early medieval gender identities may have been shaped by poorly understood social and community forces, not personal choices, Moilanen says.</p>



<p>Men today vary greatly in their responses to Klinefelter syndrome, says psychologist Chris Kraft, codirector of clinical services at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Sex and Gender Clinic. Some develop nontraditional gender identities, while others express confusion about their gender identity. But many men with Klinefelter syndrome adopt a traditional gender identity for their biological sex. Reasons for these differences are poorly understood.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to know how someone in early medieval Finland would have reacted to having Klinefelter syndrome,” Kraft says.</p>



<p>Intriguingly, though, the Suontaka individual not only had a likely case of Klinefelter syndrome but was also buried with that curious mix of male and female items. Moilanen’s group studied 23 animal hairs and three bird feather fragments retrieved from soil that had been excavated with the leg-bone fragments. Based on that evidence, the Suontaka individual was likely dressed in feminine clothes made of sheep’s wool and furs from animals that included rabbits or hares, the researchers say. Bird feathers came from a pillow or bedding, which along with brooches placed in the grave were associated with females, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>But in a move closely tied to early medieval ideas about masculinity, a hiltless sword was apparently placed on top of the man’s body at the time of burial. A fancier sword with a carved bronze hilt was probably placed next to the body later, perhaps to show continuing respect for the Suontaka individual, the investigators suggest.</p>

<p>The new study plausibly suggests that the Suontaka grave held a respected person who had neither a typical male nor female sense of their social gender identity, says archaeologist Marianne Moen of the University of Oslo, who was not part of Moilanen’s group.</p>



<p>But even if a woman had been placed in the grave with swords and jewelry, the evidence would indicate that some individuals with outside-of-the-box identities — such as a woman who viewed herself as biologically female but socially male according to conventions about warriors at the time — were respected in early medieval Finland and perhaps elsewhere in Scandinavia, Moen adds.</p>



<p>Other researchers have controversially proposed that an approximately 1,000-year-old grave in Sweden held the remains either of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-ignites-debate-over-whether-women-were-viking-warriors">a Viking warrior woman</a> or a woman buried with the apparel and weapons of a warrior (<em>SN: 9/13/17</em>).</p>



<p>Rare instances in Scandinavia of early medieval graves containing men who were buried with jewelry and other feminine items have been difficult to interpret. Perhaps the closest parallel to the Suontaka individual is a man who was interred at Vivallen, Sweden, nearly 1,000 years ago with attire of both high-ranking males and females, as well as jewelry and a small knife, Moilanen says. Some researchers suspect that this man was a ritual specialist, since there is evidence that shamans dressed in women’s clothes in early medieval Scandinavia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-aurora-poles-super-heat-upper-atmosphere">Jupiter’s intense auroras superheat its upper atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is hundreds of degrees warmer than expected. After a decades-long search, scientists may have pinned down a likely source of that anomalous heat. The culprit, a new study suggests, is the planet’s intense auroras, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-electrons-space-magnetic-field-waves-earth">Jupiter’s version of Earth’s northern and southern lights</a> (<em>SN: 6/8/21</em>).</p>



<p>The temperature of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, which orbits an average distance of 778 million kilometers from the sun, should be about –73° Celsius, says James O’Donoghue, a planetary scientist at the JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Sagamihara, Japan. That’s largely due to the feeble illumination of the sun there, which amounts to less than 4 percent of the energy per square meter that hits Earth’s atmosphere. Instead, the region several hundred kilometers above the planet’s cloud tops has an average temperature of about 426° C.</p>



<p>Scientists first noticed this mismatch more than 40 years ago. Since then, researchers have come up with several ideas about where the upper atmosphere’s thermal boost might originate, including pressure waves or gravity waves created by turbulence lower in the atmosphere. But observations by O’Donoghue and his colleagues now provide convincing evidence that the auroras pump heat throughout the planet’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>The researchers used the 10-meter Keck II telescope atop Hawaii’s dormant Mauna Kea volcano to observe Jupiter on one night each in 2016 and 2017. Specifically, the team looked for infrared emissions that betray the presence of positively charged hydrogen molecules (H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). Those molecules are created when charged particles in the solar wind, among other sources, slam into the planet’s atmosphere at hundreds or thousands of kilometers per second, painting polar auroras.</p>





<p>Measuring the intensities of these molecules’ infrared emissions let the team pin down how hot it gets high above the cloud tops. In those polar regions, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03706-w">temperatures in the upper atmosphere likely top out at about 725° C</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 5 <em>Nature. </em>But at equatorial latitudes, the team’s heat map showed that the temperature falls to about 325° C. That pattern of a gradual drop-off in temperature toward lower latitudes bolsters the notion that Jupiter’s auroras are the source of anomalous heat in the upper atmosphere and that winds disperse that warmth from the polar regions.</p>



<p>One of the nights the team observed Jupiter — January 25, 2017 — was particularly well-timed because Jupiter was experiencing a strong solar flare at the time. Besides an intense aurora, data revealed a broad swath of warmer-than-normal gases at mid-latitudes, which the researchers interpret as a wave of warmth rolling southward. “It was pure luck that we captured this potential heat-shedding event,” says O’Donoghue.</p>



<p>The team’s observations “are close to a ‘smoking gun’ for the redistribution of auroral energy,” says Tommi Koskinen, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The next challenge, he notes, is to understand the underlying mechanisms of heat production and heat transfer and to then incorporate them into researchers’ simulations of Jupiter’s atmospheric circulation.</p>
