Remember the 'voodoo' fMRI controversy? Well, I just came across a new voodoo-ish paper - just in time for Halloween.

The study, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, comes from Franziska Plessow and colleagues of Boston. The main claim is that a dose of oxytocin reduced the response of "reward-related food motivation brain regions" to pictures of high-calorie foods, suggesting that the hormone might be of use in the treatment of obesity.



However, I have some questions.

<p>Hello, everyone! I’m Arda Cigin, founder of <a href="http://stoic-leaders.com/my-vision-arda-cigin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Stoic-Leaders.com</strong></a> and in this article, I’m about to change your whole mindset towards all “disadvantages” and “less than stellar situations”.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>I’ll be telling you about the battle between David and Goliath as an instructive case study to understand how advantages can actually be the source of our greatest weakness, and vice versa.</p>
<p>And then, I’ll give you many practical solutions and mindset shifts that you can apply to your life today to turn disadvantages circumstances into your greatest strengths.</p>
<p>But before we get into the insights, for those who may not know, let’s analyze David and Goliath’s timeless story.</p>
<h3><strong>– Why even tell a story?</strong></h3>
<p>I want to tell a story because the human brain relates through stories, not facts and theories. If you truly want to take away an action plan at the end of this article, pay attention to this timeless story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Instructive Story of David and Goliath</strong></h1>
<p>Goliath is this giant who is six-foot nine, wearing a bronze helmet and full body armor. He is carrying a javelin, a spear, and a sword.</p>
<p>Why? Because he is about to go into a fierce battle.</p>
<p>The giant, Goliath was about to fight with a fledgling shepherd boy named, David.</p>
<p>David, as a fragile young man, inherently knew he was incomparably weak to his opponent, yet he wanted to take the stand and confront the wrath of Goliath nonetheless.</p>
<p>Is David’s confidence misplaced? Maybe there is more to David than meets the eye…</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone judged David to have no chance against Goliath. Most people who looked at this combat duo would bet their money on Goliath.</p>
<p>And trust me. You would too.</p>
<p>If we were to observe Goliath, he was prepared for close combat since he was wearing heavy armor and was armed with various spears and swords.</p>
<p>What many didn’t know was that the great and almighty Goliath, who was regarded as the supreme winner of this fight, had one fatal, characteristic flaw:</p>
<p>He had awful eye-sight.</p>
<p>That being said, the fight started.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, Goliath shouted the words “Come to me!”.</p>
<p>Yet do not mistake this as an arrogant battle cry. Goliath needed David to be in arm’s-length so that he could see David and defeat him. It was more of a desperate cry than anything else, a definite side effect of his weak eyesight.</p>
<p>If you think about it, Goliath didn’t excel in close combat just because he chose to do so. He had no other option but to excel in close combat.</p>
<p>Remember his awful eye-sight? If he were to be a strong warrior, he can not be a long-ranged one like an archer. Combined with his bulky physical nature, a simple fault in eye-sight turned Goliath into a wrathful close-ranged warrior with almost-blind eyes.</p>
<p>Goliath was on, what Robert Greene calls, the “death ground”.</p>
<p>He was trapped and had no other option. Either he was going to master close combat or he’d lead his life as a blind giant. With the help of outside pressures and internal obstacles, he became the best in his niche—ruthless close combat.</p>
<p>David, the fragile young man, may be a shepherd but he was a smart boy. He was not going to fight with Goliath in close combat. That would be foolish.</p>
<p>Therefore, he’d prepared himself for a long-ranged combat—a kind of fight Goliath was not prepared for.</p>
<p>As Goliath started to get agitated, David took out his trusty slingshot, swiftly positioned a rock, pulled the end of the sling and shot right at the forehead of the giant.</p>
<p>Goliath couldn’t even see the rock because of his faulty eyesight.</p>
<p>The speed at which the rock traveled was more than enough to put Goliath into a deep slumber he’d never wake up from.</p>
<p>And so the shepherd boy won the fight he was predestined to lose. All the cards were stacked against him, or so it appeared.</p>
<p>A supremely disadvantageous fragile man came to be victorious against a supremely advantageous killing machine.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone was shocked. They told themselves how lucky David was.</p>
<p>But this has nothing to do with luck.</p>
<p>All the spectators were wrong. There was one thing David was far superior to Goliath in.</p>
<p>It was neither his size nor his strength, but his ability to think strategically.</p>
<p>And this exact strategy that David had used to kill Goliath will be the topic of our discussion today.</p>
<p>______</p>
<p>Most often in life, strategic thinking is the secret ingredient to turning unfavorable situations into favorable ones</p>
<p><strong>Understand: Strategic minds will always rise victorious—whatever the circumstance, whoever the enemy.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Can We Learn From The Grand Strategist, David?</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1) Adaptation: make it your greatest asset</strong></h2>
<p>While we are making decisions, if it proved successful before, we tend to repeat the same tactics and maneuvers we’ve familiarized ourselves with.</p>
<p>Humans are innately lazy creatures and naturally, we cling to what succeeded before and expect it to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>This move will prove ineffective in the long term.</p>
<p>Realize: by doing so, you only create rigid pathways, neural-connections, and habits you are better off not adopting.</p>
<p><strong>I want you to see life as a chess game. As long as you repeat the same moves, you are bound to lose.</strong></p>
<p>Always have the flexibility to adapt to your ever-changing circumstances. If something doesn’t work (e.g., self-actualization efforts or business and career success), then change your actions and thoughts. Start thinking strategically to find options that you haven’t thought of before.</p>
<p>Make adaptability your greatest asset.</p>
<p>As Darwin pointed out,</p>
<p><strong>It is neither the survival of the strongest nor smartest, but the most adaptable.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>2) Shift the Battlefield </strong></h2>
<p>Close combat? That’s what Goliath wants.</p>
<p>Use your wits: In this circumstance, always use the slingshot, never the sword.</p>
<p><strong>Understand: Never play in a field you are oblivious to. The knowledge of the terrain will give you unimaginable and untold power.</strong></p>
<p>Realize: no one can force you to play a game you suck at. If they attempt such a thing, just politely decline, as David did, lead them into playing in your arena—a field where no one but you holds the cards. A field where you become the god and they become the puppet.</p>
<p>The lure of such power is undeniable, don’t you think?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>  3) The Phenomenon of the Masked Opposite</strong></h2>
<p>Most often in life, people tend to mistake appearance for reality. In your interactions with people, always remember the facade of appearances. No one is as they appear to be.<br />
<strong></strong></p><strong>
<blockquote><p>Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are – Nicollo Machiavelli</p></blockquote>
</strong><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>When you confront your enemies, never be intimidated by their appearances. Instead look at the parts that make up the whole. Once you identified the weakness, attack with all your might. They’ll surely fall swiftly just like Goliath.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: The hypocrital nature of appearances always deceives the naive </strong></p>
<p>If you see an extreme behavior pattern in someone (e.g., superiority, arrogance, extreme shyness, avoidance) you are most often confronted with the phenomenon of the masked opposite—what you see is actually the exact opposite.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If someone acts particularly arrogant, realize that they are actually trying to mask their insecurity and lack of confidence. Someone who is already confident wouldn’t need to act superior in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>If someone smiles incessantly and laughs at every little thing you say, would you assume they are being natural? </strong></p>
<p>No, of course not. They are only using what I’d like to call “the supreme joker mask”. No one can be extremely happy and euphoric all the time. Therefore, they are only happy when you are around.</p>
<p>Maybe they like you and want you to like them back, maybe they want to get close to you and hurt you or maybe they just want to break the ice, whatever the reason might be, they are wearing a mask that most definitely does not express their actual feelings.</p>
<p>You need to train yourself to see what is underneath the mask. Everyone you meet will wear some sort of mask. And there is a reason for that.</p>
<p>If we openly judged people around us, naturally we’d generate unnecessary offense and malice. Therefore, from an early age, most of us have learned to hide our real thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we’d be vulnerable and open to attacks. We’d be left alone and isolated. To prevent such unfavorable situations, we choose to cooperate and hide our less than favorable qualities.</p>
<p>This is really nothing more than our ancestor survival instincts.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is actually insecure but masking it with arrogance, you need to get them to drop their guards.</p>
<p>They need to lose the control. Do something that will make them panic. Anger them on purpose if necessary.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Final Words</strong></h1>
<p>As final words, I want you to remember David and Goliath’s story every time you find yourself in a less than ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>– You financially struggle but want to start your own coaching business?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that’s good, because. it is possible to bootstrap an online business by being creative and resourceful.</p>
<p>While wealthy business owners spend billions of dollars on advertisements—mistaking ad-generated customers for long term customers—you’ll find your unique selling proposition and create loyal customers much faster thanks to your creative product, resourceful marketing, and sheer hustle.</p>
<p>Starting a business without capital, especially nowadays, is actually a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>– You want to write a book but you are not native? </strong></p>
<p>Well, that’s good. As a language learner, your humble determination towards studying grammar, vocabulary, and phrases will enable you to get a better grasp of the nuances where most native writers will get over confident and skip the many important stages of becoming a writer—understanding how narratives work, how readers are captivated, how great writers structure stories.</p>
<p>Your humble and hardworking attitude towards writing will enable you to progress at a faster rate than most native writers.</p>
<p><strong>Can you see the power of this strategy?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing can be a disadvantage for you if you are equipped with the right mindset.</p>
<p>Before we wrap this up, don’t forget to share this article and comment below if you’ve experienced a similar “David and Goliath” situation.</p>
<p>Were you in David’s or Goliath’s position? Do you have any specific stories you would like to ask me about?</p>
<p>I’d love to hear your story. (I reply to almost all comments)</p>

From <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10534-001">Howe et al, 2017</a></em></figure><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a><p></p>
<p>A lot of clinical research tries its best to find the true effects of a treatment above and beyond the placebo effect – that is, the benefits that can arise purely from a person’s expectations that an intervention will be helpful. A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10534-001">new study</a> in <em>Health Psychology</em> takes a different approach: instead of always seeing the placebo effect as “a nuisance variable with mysterious impact”, argue Lauren Howe and her colleagues at Stanford University, we should try to find out more about how to enhance it, and how to diminish its harmful twin, the nocebo effect (when negative expectations can lead to harmful effects). To this end, the researchers examined the possible moderating influence of a physician’s demeanour, finding that the placebo effect is enhanced by the impression of warmth and competence.</p>
<p>Howe and her team write: “Among the many demands of a career in medicine, physicians have been increasingly directed to build rapport with their patients (e.g., by exhibiting empathy). This research suggests a compelling reason for why physicians should pay attention to these psychological and social forces: They can impact physiological health outcomes.”</p>
<p><span id="more-31490"></span></p>
<p>The study involved 164 healthy participants who thought they were taking part in an investigation into food preferences. As part of this, they were told that they would first need to undergo an allergy test. A female doctor gave them an injection of histamine, which reliably induces an allergic reaction in the skin, including swelling and redness. After the injection, the doctor applied some inert cream to the injection site, which she told some participants would reduce any allergic reaction, while she told others it would increase their allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Crucially, the participants were divided into four further groups, for which the doctor adapted her demeanour and behaviour to be either: highly warm and competent; low on warmth and competence; high competence but low warmth; or low competence but high warmth.</p>
<p>For instance, to appear warm, the doctor might ask the participant’s name and give her own, but in the low warmth condition she would not bother with these introductions. To appear competent, the doctor made eye contact and spoke eloquently (but did the opposite to appear less competent). Environmental cues added to the effect – for instance, in the high competence condition, the doctor’s office was clean and tidy whereas it was messy and disorganised in the low competence condition.</p>
<p>After a histamine injection, the physiological effects appear on the skin rapidly over a course of minutes. The doctor traced the size of the unfolding allergic reaction several times for each participant and these traces were then sent for measuring by a research assistant who was unaware of which participant was in which trial condition.</p>
<p>The results showed that the placebo effect was enhanced when the doctor appeared both warm and competent: that is, the allergic reaction was smaller when the doctor said the cream would have this effect, and when she was more likeable and credible (when she was warm or competent, but not both, the placebo effect was of intermediate size).</p>
<p>In real life, of course, doctors don’t only raise positive expectations about treatment (which can induce a placebo effect), but they also warn about side-effects and adverse consequences, which may provoke self-fulfilling negative expectations in the patient. The researchers had thought that physician warmth and competence might also amplify this nocebo effect: that is, increase the allergic reaction when the doctor said the cream would have this effect, but there was no evidence for this happening.</p>
<p>It’s important not to over-generalise these findings: for instance, the participants were all healthy; the observed placebo-enhancing effects occurred over a very short time-scale; and it’s not clear if the findings would be the same with a male doctor. Nonetheless, the study introduces an elegantly simple procedure for investigating factors that may interact with the placebo effect, and the fascinating findings are ripe for further investigation.</p>
<p>“Future research could elaborate on the precise mechanisms through which expectations impact physiology,” the researchers said. “For example, the manipulation of positive and negative expectations in this study could have served to decrease or increase patient anxiety, prompted cognitive reappraisals of the treatment, and/or changed where participants directed their attention during the medical procedure. We look forward to studies that explore these and other intriguing possibilities.”</p>

<p>“In the dark, in the quiet, in the lonely stillness, the aggrieved struggle to rescue sleep from vigilance.” This arresting sentence introduces a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717301638">new review</a> of insomnia in <i>Behaviour Research and Therapy </i>that addresses a troubling fact observed in sleep labs across the world: poor sleep is not sufficient to make people consider themselves to have the condition… and poor sleep may not even be necessary. The paper, by Kenneth Lichstein at the University of Alabama, explores the implications of “Insomnia Identity”: how it contributes to health problems, and may be an obstacle to recovery.</p>
<p><span id="more-31502"></span></p>
<p>The hallmark of insomnia is regularly having such poor sleep that it affects your daily function. This implies a person with insomnia will have poor sleep, as measured objectively, and that they will complain about their lack of sleep. To get a sense of how poor sleep and reports of insomnia interact, Lichstein reviewed twenty studies that measured each of these aspects separately, with questions like “How long does it typically take you to get to sleep?” on the one hand, and on the other, questions like “Are you dissatisfied with your sleep?” or direct probes into how confident the person was that they struggled with insomnia.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that poor sleep in itself is not sufficient to produce insomnia. A 1995 study looked at 400 community volunteers (age 55 or more), and found that the majority of people who were technically poor sleepers (in this case, six months where it took 30 minutes or more of struggle to fall asleep on at least three nights per week) did <i>not</i> experience distress or consider themselves to have insomnia. These “non-complaining poor sleepers” were no more impaired in terms of daily fatigue than those who got good sleep, nor did they have high anxiety.</p>
<p>Studies using polysomnography (which involves brain wave recordings and other physiological measures of sleep state) and sleep diaries – both considered more accurate ways of establishing quality of sleep than simple recall – have reinforced these findings. One replication also showed non-complaining sleepers had levels of anxiety and depression no higher than the general population. And a large data set of 1700 participants found that whereas short sleep was associated with a 350-500 per cent increase in hypertension (correlated with severity of sleep deficit), this wasn’t the case for people who didn’t consider themselves to have insomnia, for whom there was no relationship between sleep duration and blood pressure. So poor sleep doesn’t inevitably cause the experience of insomnia, nor produce the knock-on health effects associated with insomnia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, poor sleep isn’t necessary for people to complain that they have insomnia. Polysomnography and sleep diary studies show clearly that people whose sleeping patterns do not meet clinical criteria for poor sleep can nonetheless believe that they suffer insomnia. What’s more, these “complaining good sleepers” can have as high impairment in terms of daily fatigue, anxiety and depression as those suffering under a clinical deficit of sleep. Recent work <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0005-7967(17)30163-8/sref113">suggests</a> that quality of the sleep you experience has, in itself, no relationship to suicidal thoughts. Suicidal thoughts are instead, related to whether you feel you have sleep problems, regardless of whether or not you do.</p>
<p>Summing across the major studies that separate out sleep quality from insomnia complaint, Lichtstein reports that 37 per cent of individuals complaining of insomnia “do not have poor sleep by conventional standards”. This is not to say that their sleep was flawless, or that it wasn’t worse than average in some way, but it certainly falls in the normal range. On the other hand, many individuals with non-normal levels of sleep problems are able to exist as if free from insomnia. What is going on?</p>

Temperaments drawn to hypochondria, or liable to catastrophic thinking (believed to contribute to some chronic pain conditions) may symptomise minor events or exaggerate their implications. If symptoms are in remission, insomniacs may be hypervigilant for even a single night’s poor sleep as evidence that “it’s back”. Such anxieties make sleep harder, and also colour the edges of sleeping existence with the dread that Lichstein alludes to in his opening sentence. In principle, bed-time can become a living hell even if the actual sleeping difficulties are not remarkable, or scarcely different from a poor sleeper who doesn’t attend to it as an issue.</p>
<p>It may be especially difficult for therapists to help people with an insomnia identity – even when a therapist succeeds in helping such a client improve their sleep, it’s likely their belief they have a problem will endure. Research on insomnia stigma suggests that it’s common for sufferers to have their problem doubted: this could produce perverse incentives for hypervigilance among those with an insomnia identity and a resolute sense that their problem is real and severe.</p>
<p>As the diagnosis of insomnia usually begins with a person’s complaint about their sleep, and most medical practices offer at most a token sleep assessment before providing that diagnosis, there may be many people out there suffering because of their insomnia identity rather than an actual lack of sleep. Lichtstein recommends that in addition to CBT, we explore practices like mindfulness and dialectical practices that get the sufferer to question assumptions through questions like: what is normal sleep? Does sleep need to be perfect? Do I need to see myself as an insomniac? In these ways, psychology can conquer an affliction that keeps many in unnecessary misery.</p>

<p><b><i>by Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder, Science Exchange | <a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com">www.scienceexchange.com</a></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, we hosted a group of procurement executives from multiple industries for the 2017 Science Exchange Outsourced R&amp;D Leadership Summit. During the informative and interactive sessions, we discussed both the challenges and opportunities that organizations are facing as they seek to effectively manage outsourced R&amp;D services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From presentations by procurement leaders from major pharmaceutical companies on how they’re structuring procurement to enable innovation, to insights on how Science Exchange is pioneering new ways to make it easier to access innovation from our service providers, one of the key themes of the day was the potential for the procurement function to empower scientists to achieve breakthrough discovery. Here are some of my notes around the theme of innovation: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Procurement leaders can drive innovation, with the right tools. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pharmaceutical company procurement leader responsible for driving innovation shared that, in less than six months of working with Science Exchange, they had been able to increase their use of new, niche service providers by 11%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Innovation can be hampered by complex processes. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Foote, our Director of Service Provider Operations, presented with two of our service providers — <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ispecimen">iSpecimen</a> and LabNetwork, a <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/wuxi-apptec-research-service-division">WuXi AppTec </a>company– about new technology integrations with our platform. These integrations allow Science Exchange users to access the iSpecimen and LabNetwork marketplaces through a seamless access point on our platform — no barriers to innovation!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexible, agile procurement support helps drive innovation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a panel discussion that I moderated, procurement leaders from three global pharmaceutical companies examined the need to more flexible and agile when it comes to managing R&amp;D requests, and supporting the R&amp;D business through an end-to-end process. They also discussed how their organizations must strategically examine the best mix of internal and external capabilities, core strengths and capacity when it comes to maximizing R&amp;D innovation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another theme that surfaced during the Summit was risk mitigation, including the need to better manage confidentiality, data security and intellectual property (IP), and how to prepare for business continuity — whether caused by security breaches or natural disasters. My notes on the theme of risk mitigation: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Proactively mitigate risk. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the panel discussion, procurement leaders talked about the need to move beyond a “paper exercise” for managing risk, to a more proactive and rigorous approach to protecting their companies from data and security breaches and business continuity issues. One panelist discussed the drive for holding the business accountable for third-party risk oversight on a global scale, to move beyond that “check the box” mentality.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Balance risk and innovation opportunity. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another panelist emphasized how important it is to strike the delicate balance between managing risk and enabling innovation, to ensure that businesses are protected without slowing down or blocking important scientific discoveries.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ask the right questions to assess risk. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Director of Contracts &amp; Compliance, Andrew Gutierrez, highlighted the need to ask the right questions in developing contracts and programs that will protect a company’s confidentiality and IP. He also talked about the need to verify how your data is being protected by your partners to ensure compliance with global regulations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Science Exchange Summit gave our entire team an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the needs of global procurement leaders, and our attendees gained insights to bring back to their own organizations, and a network of experts to collaborate with in the future. I look forward to continuing these discussions with our customers so we can continue to learn from one another and accelerate scientific discovery!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/25/antidepressants-during-pregnancy-dangerous-for-the-child/">Antidepressants During Pregnancy Dangerous for the Child?</a></h4>

<p>Depression is sometimes described as a disease of modernity, as sharp changes in lifestyle during the last century or so have given rise to many chronic disorders including or linked to depression. Depression is a state of low mood: the person affected tends to lose interest in previously enjoyable activities. In severe cases, self-harm is also possible. Fortunately, there are many options available today to help treat this condition.</p>
<p>Research studies and statistics show that although pregnant women are less prone to major depression, they are more inclined to minor depressive episodes. The prevalence of depression can be anywhere between 8–16% among pregnant women. There are also higher chances that diagnosis of depression is overlooked in pregnant women.</p>
<p>The treatment of depression is quite challenging in pregnancy, as medical specialists have to weigh the benefits of treatment against the risks for the mother and the health of her unborn baby. Furthermore, the health professional has to take into consideration the risks and benefits of any such therapy to the long-term health of the child. New research seems to indicate that treatment of pregnant women with antidepressant drugs may increase the risk of autism, disturbances in motor function, and mental health problem in children. Some of these issues may become clear later in the life, thus studying this subject remains a challenge for researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Why treat depression in pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p>There is a widespread misconception that depression is not as threatening as other medical illnesses. Thus, treating depression is viewed as a matter of choice or even a luxury. Moreover, many patients that are on antidepressant drugs before pregnancy are in the remissive stage. Therefore, their doctors may think of discontinuing the therapy.</p>
<p>However, if a pregnant woman that is vulnerable to depression is not provided with antidepressant therapy, there is a higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, substance abuse in pregnancy (e.g., smoking and drinking alcohol), and a significantly higher risk of postpartum depression.</p>
<p>Research has shown that if antidepressants are discontinued for the period of the pregnancy, the relapse rate of major depression is as high as 60–70%. This can have severe consequences for the patient, family, and child. In addition, children born to mothers with untreated depression have higher levels of cortisol, which may have adverse impacts on their health.</p>
<h3>Risks of antidepressants</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, the use of antidepressants in pregnancy is a complicated issue due to possible dangers. Below are some of the common problems associated with the use of antidepressants during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persistent pulmonary hypertension</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a failure of lungs blood vessels to dilate in a child post-birth. Thus, a new-born may have breathing difficulties, a deficit of oxygen in the blood, leading to intubation. In many cases, outcomes may be fatal. This condition is also found to be related to maternal smoking, diabetes, and sepsis. Though the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in new-born increases up to six times with the use of antidepressants, at the same time there is a consensus among the medical community that non-use of antidepressants may be even more harmful.</p>
<p><strong><em>Withdrawal symptoms</em></strong></p>
<p>This is also called “poor neonatal adaptation.” These symptoms are common when a mother has been exposed to antidepressants during the third trimester of pregnancy. Some of the symptoms characteristic of this syndrome include difficulties in breathing, unstable body temperature, hypo- or hypertonia, irritability, constant crying, and seizures. Therefore, some specialists recommend tapering the dose of antidepressants in the third trimester.</p>
<p><strong><em>Motor development</em></strong></p>
<p>By motor development, we mean child’s ability to move around and handle the environment. There are clinical studies that indicate that the use of antidepressants during pregnancy may slow the motor development. A child may start walking later than other kids, or may have other problems related to movements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Autism spectrum disorders</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a neurodevelopmental disorder of children. Studies seem to show the modest increase in the risk of autism if a mother is exposed to antidepressants during the first trimester.  However, no link has been found if such treatment has been given before the pregnancy, nor much relationship has been demonstrated if the therapy was initiated in a later phase of pregnancy. Thus, researchers caution that decision of prescribing antidepressants should be taken on a case by case basis by analysing the risks and potential benefits for maternal and child health.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychiatric disorders</em></strong></p>
<p>In one of the large-scale studies, scientists analysed the data of almost one million births, and they found that the use of antidepressants in pregnancy was related to higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders later in life. Nonetheless, at the same time, researchers cautioned against jumping to the quick conclusions because it is a well-known fact that mental disorders have relation to genetics. It means that women prescribed antidepressants during the pregnancy have higher chances of passing to children the genes that may result in psychiatric diseases later in life.</p>
<p>Although antidepressants may increase the risk of specific disorders in the new-born babies or may even have a negative impact later in the life, it does not mean that antidepressants should not be taken during the pregnancy. It is essential that women should not feel guilty about taking such drugs. The medical specialists must be aware of the risks and weigh them against the benefits before they prescribe antidepressants to pregnant women.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cigs-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Electronic cigarettes will very soon be banned from public indoor spaces in New York State, making it the 11<sup>th</sup> state in line with World Health Organization guidance, which <a href="http://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop6/FCTC_COP6_10-en.pdf">called for bans on indoor vaping</a> in 2014. This comes after a bill signed on Monday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who stated that “These products are marketed as a healthier alternative to cigarettes but the reality is they also carry long-term risks to the health of users and those around them.”</p>
<p>E-cigarettes, electronic devices which mimic smoking tobacco, contain a nicotine-based liquid that is vaporized and inhaled. Since first coming to the US market in 2006, they have grown significantly in popularity among adolescents and never smokers.</p>
<h3><strong>Controversy</strong></h3>
<p>Although the health consequences of this product are not well understood, the CDC says there are still reasons for concern, with nicotine addiction being one of them. The New York State ban brings to the forefront a major public health divide between researchers in the US and UK; while US research into the smoking substitutes has focused on the potential for children to get hooked on fruity vaping flavors, the potential that children could move on to cigarettes and the detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, public health messages in England have focused on the potential for e-cigarettes and vaping products to be used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes. However, amid rapid adoption of the devices in the UK, it has also just been announced that a parliamentary panel will hold an inquiry to establish the health and economic impact of e-cigarettes which about 3 million people in the country use. The inquiry will also set out to examine whether e-cigarettes are effective at promoting quitting regular smoking or whether they instead play a role in normalizing smoking.</p>
<h3><strong>Smokers vs Non-smokers</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4671-3"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9575" height="159" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/ccigs.jpg" width="240" />Research</a> recently published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> investigated behaviors, perceptions, and motivations underlying the use of e-cigarettes in three Baltimore vape shops. The survey respondents were predominantly young, Caucasian males (which is the most common demographic among current e-cigarette users) and authors found that current smokers were more recent initiators of e-cigarette use compared to former smokers. They also found that the motivations for e-cigarette use did not significantly differ between former and current smokers. The most frequently cited primary motivation for initiation of e-cigarette use among both former and current smokers was to quit smoking tobacco, followed by the belief that they were healthier than tobacco cigarettes. The prevalence of never smokers identified in the study is consistent with several studies from the US suggesting that an increasing number of electronic cigarette users are never-smokers.</p>
<p>In 2015, <em>BMC Public Health</em> published an<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1618-4"> article</a> which showed that one in five teenagers in a large survey in the north west of England has accessed e-cigarettes, and of these, 16% have never otherwise smoked. The highest number of e-cigarette users though, were teenage smokers – of whom 75% admitted using them.  In this study, researchers from Liverpool John Moores University surveyed 16,193 secondary school students in the region aged from 14 to 17 years. The team also found that there was an association between alcohol and e-cigarette access. Students who drank alcohol were significantly more likely to have accessed e-cigarettes than non-drinkers. It was found that those who regularly drank alcohol but didn’t smoke were four times more likely to access e-cigarettes than those who didn’t drink. The findings suggest that teenagers who access e-cigarettes are those that are most susceptible to other forms of substance use and risk-taking behaviors.</p>
<p>In the first longitudinal <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3770-x">study</a> to use a nationally representative sample of U.S. smokers to provide evidence regarding the impact of e-cigarettes on smoking behavior at the U.S. population level, Karen Messer <em>et.al.</em> tested whether ever-use of e-cigarettes among early adopters was associated with: 1) increased cigarette smoking cessation; and 2) reduced cigarette consumption. They found that, among early adopters, ever-use of first generation e-cigarettes to aid quitting cigarette smoking was not associated with improved cessation or with reduced consumption, even among heavier smokers. The study advised that it was premature to conclude that e-cigarettes will be helpful to smokers who make a quit attempt; that it also seemed premature to conclude that e-cigarettes will be an effective way for smokers, especially heavy smokers, to reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke each day.</p>
<h3><strong>Marketing </strong></h3>
<p>E-cigarette companies are aggressively marketing their products in a manner akin to how tobacco was marketed in the 50s and 60s. Flavored e-liquids in particular are seen as a means to enticing young people to smoke who are also increasingly being exposed to e-cigarette adverts through TV, billboards, print media and the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1028">Research</a> published in 2014 indicated that the vast majority of information on YouTube about e-cigarettes promoted their use and depicted their use as socially acceptable. The researchers found that one of the most prevalent topics in the “pro” e-cigarette videos was a claim that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes through delivering the experience of smoking while eliminating health risks associated with tobacco smoke. They also promoted that e-cigarettes could help smokers quit smoking.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9576 alignleft" height="122" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cigsales.jpg" width="240" />With the rapid increase in the retail availability of e-cigarettes in the UK and elsewhere and the increasing concern about the rising prevalence of e-cigarette use among children and young people in particular, it is important to understand what factors predispose adolescents to initiate e-cigarette use.</p>
<p>A Scottish <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2968-2">study</a> in <em>BMC Public Health</em> examined the relationship between the recall of e-cigarette point-of-sale displays and children’s use and future intention to use e-cigarettes. Researchers found that adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes in small shops were more likely to have tried an e-cigarette and adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes for sale in small shops or supermarkets were more likely to intend to try them in the next 6 months. Further longitudinal data is required to confirm a causal relationship between e-cigarette point of sale exposure and their use and future use by young people.</p>
<h3><strong>Health effects?</strong></h3>
<p>The impact e-cigarettes have on health remains uncertain. The US National Institute on Drug Abuse has warned that these could contain potentially toxic metal nanoparticles and research has also found that the vapor from some e-cigarette products contains known carcinogens and toxic chemicals. More research is needed on the health consequences of repeated exposure to these chemicals.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>We usually think of loneliness as a condition with no redeeming features. Certainly, chronic loneliness is linked to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">poorer physical and psychological health</a>, as well as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/">unfavourable effects on personality</a>. But an evolutionary model of loneliness, pioneered by John Cacioppo at the University of Chicago, US, proposes that it has an adaptive function, in that it:</p>
<ol>
<li>makes people want to <i>do something </i>about absent or unsatisfactory social relationships, and</li>
<li>encourages people to focus on their own interests and welfare</li>
</ol>
<p>The second proposed motivational force is the focus of a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217705120">new study</a>, led John Cacioppo, and published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. The researchers predicted that feelings of loneliness would make people more self-centred – and this is exactly what they found.</p>
<p><span id="more-31441"></span></p>
<p>Cacioppo and his colleagues analysed data on 229 people living in Cook County, Illinois, who came into the University of Chicago’s Social Neuroscience Laboratory for evaluation one day a year, for ten years. When the first data was collected, in 2002/3, the participants were aged 50-68, and came from the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the region: non-Hispanic White Americans, Black and African Americans and Hispanic Americans.</p>
<p>Each year, the participants completed a package of questionnaires, including measures of depression and mood, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (20-items measure general loneliness and feelings of social isolation) and the Chronic Self-Focus scale (designed to measure self-centredness; asks participants to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements like “I think about myself a lot”).</p>
<p>The researchers found that higher levels of loneliness reported in one year were associated with higher levels of self-centredness the following year. Greater self-centredness was also associated with more loneliness the following year, but the correlation was weaker. This was after the influence of all the demographic variables were accounted for statistically.</p>
<p>The findings suggest loneliness and self-centredness are mutually reinforcing, although it’s possible the influence of some other factor(s) on both self-centredness and loneliness is responsible for this apparent link. However, current depressed mood, symptoms of depression and overall negative mood were not significantly correlated with self-centredness or loneliness at the next year’s evaluation, supporting the interpretation that loneliness and self-centreness have a direct reciprocal relationship.</p>
<p>“The small but apparent influence of self-centredness on loneliness is noteworthy because it reveals yet another factor that may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of loneliness in real-world contexts,” the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>Stopping that process could help combat loneliness into middle and older age, they think. “Targeting self-centredness as part of an intervention to lessen loneliness may help break a positive feedback loop that maintains or worsens loneliness over years.”</p>

<p>
 The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of C•G to T•A transitions, which account for half of known human pathogenic point mutations. The ability to efficiently convert target A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. While the deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we report adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs (e.g., ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently (~50% in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9%) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, induce less off-target genome modification than Cas9, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with our previous base editors, ABEs advance genome editing by enabling the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.

<p>
 Modifications on mRNA offer the potential of regulating mRNA fate post-transcriptionally. Recent studies suggested the widespread presence of N1-methyladenosine (m1A), which disrupts Watson–Crick base pairing, at internal sites of mRNAs. These studies lacked the resolution of identifying individual modified bases, and did not identify specific sequence motifs undergoing the modification or an enzymatic machinery catalysing them, rendering it challenging to validate and functionally characterize putative sites. Here we develop an approach that allows the transcriptome-wide mapping of m1A at single-nucleotide resolution. Within the cytosol, m1A is present in a low number of mRNAs, typically at low stoichiometries, and almost invariably in tRNA T-loop-like structures, where it is introduced by the TRMT6/TRMT61A complex. We identify a single m1A site in the mitochondrial ND5 mRNA, catalysed by TRMT10C, with methylation levels that are highly tissue specific and tightly developmentally controlled. m1A leads to translational repression, probably through a mechanism involving ribosomal scanning or translation. Our findings suggest that m1A on mRNA, probably because of its disruptive impact on base pairing, leads to translational repression, and is generally avoided by cells, while revealing one case in mitochondria where tight spatiotemporal control over m1A levels was adopted as a potential means of post-transcriptional regulation.

<p>
 Direct lineage conversion offers a new strategy for tissue regeneration and disease modelling. Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into various cell types, the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts progressively convert to the target cell fates remain unclear. The inherent heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process renders it difficult to study this process using bulk genomic techniques. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation and analysed global transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, we identified molecularly distinct subpopulations of cells during reprogramming. We also constructed routes of iCM formation, and delineated the relationship between cell proliferation and iCM induction. Further analysis of global gene expression changes during reprogramming revealed unexpected downregulation of factors involved in mRNA processing and splicing. Detailed functional analysis of the top candidate splicing factor, Ptbp1, revealed that it is a critical barrier for the acquisition of cardiomyocyte-specific splicing patterns in fibroblasts. Concomitantly, Ptbp1 depletion promoted cardiac transcriptome acquisition and increased iCM reprogramming efficiency. Additional quantitative analysis of our dataset revealed a strong correlation between the expression of each reprogramming factor and the progress of individual cells through the reprogramming process, and led to the discovery of new surface markers for the enrichment of iCMs. In summary, our single-cell transcriptomics approaches enabled us to reconstruct the reprogramming trajectory and to uncover intermediate cell populations, gene pathways and regulators involved in iCM induction.

<p>
 Epigenetic modifications, including chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, have a central role in the regulation of gene expression in plants and animals. The transmission of epigenetic marks is crucial for certain genes to retain cell lineage-specific expression patterns and maintain cell fate. However, the marks that have accumulated at regulatory loci during growth and development or in response to environmental stimuli need to be deleted in gametes or embryos, particularly in organisms such as plants that do not set aside a germ line, to ensure the proper development of offspring. In Arabidopsis thaliana, prolonged exposure to cold temperatures (winter cold), in a process known as vernalization, triggers the mitotically stable epigenetic silencing of the potent floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), and renders plants competent to flower in the spring; however, this silencing is reset during each generation. Here we show that the seed-specific transcription factor LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) promotes the initial establishment of an active chromatin state at FLC and activates its expression de novo in the pro-embryo, thus reversing the silenced state inherited from gametes. This active chromatin state is passed on from the pro-embryo to post-embryonic life, and leads to transmission of the embryonic memory of FLC activation to post-embryonic stages. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the reprogramming of embryonic chromatin states in plants, and provide insights into the epigenetic memory of embryonic active gene expression in post-embryonic phases, through which an embryonic factor acts to ‘control’ post-embryonic development processes that are distinct from embryogenesis in plants.

<p>
 A grand challenge of systems biology is to predict the kinetic responses of living systems to perturbations starting from the underlying molecular interactions. Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms and they remain a topic of active investigation. Although much is known about the molecular interactions that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied perturbations, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently established coarse-grained proteome allocation models from steady-state growth into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts) without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation, which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/KfP-zvTFjnE/nature24295">Reductions in global biodiversity loss predicted from conservation spending</a></h4>

<p>
             Halting global biodiversity loss is central to the Convention on Biological Diversity
                and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, but success to
                date has been very limited. A critical determinant of success
                in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining
                    biodiversity; however, financing decisions are hindered
                by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation
                    investment. For greater effectiveness, we need an
                evidence-based model that shows how conservation spending
                quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a
                model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008
                reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention on
                Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a median average of 29%
                per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be
                predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of
                conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population
                growth (human development pressures).
                Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed
                biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development
                pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that
                the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies
                that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for
                balancing the Sustainable Development Goals of human development and maintaining
                biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be
                needed as human development proceeds.

<p>
 Interleukin-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8, also known as single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related receptor, SIGIRR, or TIR8) is a member of the IL-1 receptor (ILR) family with distinct structural and functional characteristics, acting as a negative regulator of ILR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) downstream signalling pathways and inflammation. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells which mediate resistance against pathogens and contribute to the activation and orientation of adaptive immune responses. NK cells mediate resistance against haematopoietic neoplasms but are generally considered to play a minor role in solid tumour carcinogenesis. Here we report that IL-1R8 serves as a checkpoint for NK cell maturation and effector function. Its genetic blockade unleashes NK-cell-mediated resistance to hepatic carcinogenesis, haematogenous liver and lung metastasis, and cytomegalovirus infection.

<p>
 The regulation of size, volume and mass in living cells is physiologically important, and dysregulation of these parameters gives rise to many diseases. Cell mass is largely determined by the amount of water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids present in a cell, and is tightly linked to metabolism, proliferation and gene expression. Technologies have emerged in recent years that make it possible to track the masses of single suspended cells and adherent cells. However, it has not been possible to track individual adherent cells in physiological conditions at the mass and time resolutions required to observe fast cellular dynamics. Here we introduce a cell balance (a ‘picobalance’), based on an optically excited microresonator, that measures the total mass of single or multiple adherent cells in culture conditions over days with millisecond time resolution and picogram mass sensitivity. Using our technique, we observe that the mass of living mammalian cells fluctuates intrinsically by around one to four per cent over timescales of seconds throughout the cell cycle. Perturbation experiments link these mass fluctuations to the basic cellular processes of ATP synthesis and water transport. Furthermore, we show that growth and cell cycle progression are arrested in cells infected with vaccinia virus, but mass fluctuations continue until cell death. Our measurements suggest that all living cells show fast and subtle mass fluctuations throughout the cell cycle. As our cell balance is easy to handle and compatible with fluorescence microscopy, we anticipate that our approach will contribute to the understanding of cell mass regulation in various cell states and across timescales, which is important in areas including physiology, cancer research, stem-cell differentiation and drug discovery.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/bZ5kFKZplFU/nature24283">Reversing SKI–SMAD4-mediated suppression is essential for TH17 cell differentiation</a></h4>

<p>
 T helper 17 (TH17) cells are critically involved in host defence, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is instrumental in TH17 cell differentiation by cooperating with interleukin-6 (refs 6, 7). Yet, the mechanism by which TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation remains elusive. Here we reveal that TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation by reversing SKI–SMAD4-mediated suppression of the expression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). We found that, unlike wild-type T cells, SMAD4-deficient T cells differentiate into TH17 cells in the absence of TGFβ signalling in a RORγt-dependent manner. Ectopic SMAD4 expression suppresses RORγt expression and TH17 cell differentiation of SMAD4-deficient T cells. However, TGFβ neutralizes SMAD4-mediated suppression without affecting SMAD4 binding to the Rorc locus. Proteomic analysis revealed that SMAD4 interacts with SKI, a transcriptional repressor that is degraded upon TGFβ stimulation. SKI controls histone acetylation and deacetylation of the Rorc locus and TH17 cell differentiation via SMAD4: ectopic SKI expression inhibits H3K9 acetylation of the Rorc locus, Rorc expression, and TH17 cell differentiation in a SMAD4-dependent manner. Therefore, TGFβ-induced disruption of SKI reverses SKI–SMAD4-mediated suppression of RORγt to enable TH17 cell differentiation. This study reveals a critical mechanism by which TGFβ controls TH17 cell differentiation and uncovers the SKI–SMAD4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for treating TH17-related diseases.

<p>Science Exchange is the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;D) services, and the iSpecimen Marketplace is the premier online platform instantly connecting life science researchers in need of human biospecimens with the healthcare organizations that have them. By integrating these two solutions, Science Exchange users will now have access in real time to more than 25 million banked and prospectively collected specimens, including biofluids, solid tissue, and cells, all available on the iSpecimen Marketplace.</p>
<p>“iSpecimen shares our commitment to accelerating breakthrough scientific discovery through innovative technology,” said <span class="xn-person">Elizabeth Iorns</span>, PhD, Founder and CEO, Science Exchange. “With the seamless integration of the iSpecimen Marketplace and Science Exchange platform, our users gain direct, on-demand access to millions of human biospecimens.”</p>
<p>While iSpecimen has been available through Science Exchange since 2014, the new integration minimizes the time and complexity involved with specimen procurement. Additionally, the legal and compliance infrastructure in place for Science Exchange users reduces the risks often associated with biospecimen procurement. In the iSpecimen Marketplace, researchers have instant access to compliance documentation on a per specimen basis, giving researchers assurance before obtaining specimens that their requested samples were ethically sourced with appropriate regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>“The drive towards precision medicine is advancing the pace of research and increasing the need for biospecimens and related services,” said <span class="xn-person">Christopher Ianelli</span>, MD, PhD, Founder and CEO, iSpecimen. “The integration of the iSpecimen Marketplace into the Science Exchange environment accelerates research by giving scientists broader access to specimens from within the world’s leading platform for outsourced scientific services. We are honored to be working with Science Exchange in this way.”</p>
<p>Researchers interested in iSpecimen and Science Exchange can learn more and see demonstrations this week at <a class="linkOnClick" data-include="300541759" href="https://procureconpharma.wbresearch.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ProcureCon Pharma</a> in <span class="xn-location">Philadelphia</span>, where both Ianelli and Iorns will be speaking as part of a plenary panel.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/24/the-most-important-thing-we-can-do-for-our-brain-exercise/">The Most Important Thing We Can Do for Our Brain? Exercise!</a></h4>

<p>If I would have guessed ten years ago what the best way to train the brain would be, I would probably have thought about crossword puzzles, sudoku, or cognitive apps. But then I would be wrong. The best way is physical exercise. During the last decade, neuroscience has shown that physical exercise has extraordinary effects on our brain.</p>
<p>Most people know by now that exercise will improve their mood—but few know that it will boost <em>all</em> of their cognitive abilities—memory, attention, creativity, and how we cope with stress. It all gets better in a way unparalleled by any drug, food-supplement, or cognitive training method.</p>
<p>So what happens in our brain when we move? First. the brain gets more blood. Bloodflow is increased by 20% while walking fast compared to sitting. More blood means more oxygen and nutrients. But increased bloodflow is only the beginning. The rate of neurogenesis—the formation of new brain cells—is increased by exercise. The newly born brain cells are formed in the dentate gyrus, a part of the hippocampus known as the “memory center”, and the effect is substantial. The hippocampus actually grew by 2% when a group of sedentary individuals walked regularly for a year. Typically, the hippocampus shrinks by up to 1% per year from our late twenties onwards, contributing to gradual memory loss as we get older. The exercise-based boost of hippocampal growth not only increases memory but improves mood. Exercise has been shown to be as efficient as antidepressants for mild and moderate depression, useful information in an age where more than one in ten adults are prescribed antidepressants in the US.</p>
<p>How about kids? Exercise does wonders to children’s cognitive abilities and their ability to learn. Just 20 minutes of playing increases math and reading test scores. And this isn’t exclusive to tests in the lab, several studies have shown that kids in good shape actually perform better in school. Physical activity even seems to affect IQ! When data from the Swedish military service was analyzed from 1.2 million 18-year old male Swedes a clear pattern emerged—boys in good cardiovascular fitness had higher IQs, a result that was also apparent for identical twins. In a number of identical twins, one brother was in good shape while the other brother was not. The brother in good shape had a higher IQ than his identical twin—even though they, more or less, have identical genes (there can be small differences in identical twins) and have grown up together!</p>
<p>The list goes even further. Exercise can make us more creative. A recent study showed that creativity test results for divergent thinking (“brainstorming”) increased by more than 50% if participants had walked for 45 minutes before the test. The creativity-boost is temporary, we get more creative during 1-2 hours after exercise—probably due to increased blood flow, than we are back to our normal creativity-level. The takeaway message is: if you are stuck with a problem, then go for a walk or jog, and rethink of the problem an hour afterward and increase your chances of coming up with a solution.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> is exercise so important for the brain? It is not at all obvious from our modern perspective but makes more sense if we look at our history. Our brains are basically the same today as they were 10 000 years ago. It was when our ancestors moved: during hunting, running from predators, and discovering new lands, that they really needed their cognitive abilities. That was when they needed to be attentive and have a memory to remember new experiences. That is why evolution has slowly tailored the brain in such a way that it benefits from exercise and that is why we still benefit from it today as our brains have not grossly changed since our ancestors days on the savanna.</p>
<p>While the human brain is fundamentally unchanged in the past 10 000 or even 20 000 years or so, our lifestyle has changed enormously. Modern sedentary lifestyle deprives many of us from getting enough physical activity, leading to vast consequences not only in terms of obesity and type-2 diabetes but also when it comes to wellbeing and how we function mentally. Exercise is not about sports. It is not about participating in a lifestyle. It is something we need to do for our brain and cognitive abilities since we have evolved for it. Now neuroscience is helping us to rediscover the brain-medicine that we forgot.</p>

<p>When technological advances paved the way for digital books, films and music, many commentators predicted the demise of their physical equivalents. It hasn’t happened, so far at least. For instance, while there is a huge market in e-books, print books remain dominant. A large part of the reason comes down to psychology – we value things that we own, or anticipate owning, in large part because <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-26/edition-8/psychology-stuff-and-things">we see them as an extension of ourselves</a>. And, stated simply, it’s easier to develop meaningful feelings of ownership over a physical entity than a digital one. A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucx102/4430295/Digital-Goods-Are-Valued-Less-Than-Physical-Goods?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> presents a series of studies that demonstrate this difference. “Our findings illustrate how psychological ownership engenders a difference in the perceived value of physical and digital goods, yielding new insights into the relationship between consumers and their possessions,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-31333"></span></p>
<p>In an initial study at a tourist destination, Ozgun Atasoy and Carey Morewedge arranged for 86 visitors to have their photograph taken with an actor dressed as a historical character. Half the visitors were given a digital photo (emailed to them straight away), the others were handed a physical copy. Then they were asked how much they were willing to pay, if anything, for their photo, with the proceeds going to charity. The recipients of a physical photo were willing to pay more, on average, and not because they thought the production costs were higher.</p>
<p>It was a similar story when Atasoy and Morewedge asked hundreds of American volunteers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk survey website to say what they would be willing to pay for either physical or digital versions of the book <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> and physical or digital versions of the movie <em>Dark Knight</em>. The participants placed higher monetary value on the physical versions, and this seemed to be because they expected to have a stronger sense of ownership for them (for the physical versions, they agreed more strongly with statements like “I will feel like I own it” and “feel like it is mine”). In contrast, participants’ anticipated enjoyment was the same for the different versions and so can’t explain the higher value placed on physical.</p>
<p>In further studies, the researchers showed that the greater value that participants no longer placed higher value on physical objects over digital when they would be renting rather than buying – presumably because the greater appeal of owning something physical is irrelevant in this case. Likewise, the researchers found that participants who identified strongly with a particular movie (<em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>) placed higher value on owning a physical copy versus digital, but participants who had no personal connection with the film did not. This fits the researchers’ theorising because the greater sense of ownership afforded by a physical product is only an enticing prospect when there’s a motivation to experience a strong sense of connection with it.</p>
<p>If it is a greater psychological sense of ownership that makes physical objects so appealing, then the researchers reasoned that people disposed with more “need for control” will be particularly attracted to them – after all, to own something is to control it. Atasoy and Morewedge found some support for this in their final study. The higher that participants scored on a “need for control scale” (they agreed with items like “I prefer doing my own planning”), the more than they tended to say that physical books would engender a greater sense of ownership, and, in turn, this was associated with their being willing to pay a higher amount for them, compared with digital.</p>
<p>The findings have some intriguing interesting implications for companies seeking to boost the appeal of digital products, the researchers said. Any interventions that might engender a greater psychological sense of ownership over digital entities will likely boost their value – such as allowing for personalisation or being able to interact with them in some way. Similarly, the results may help explain the ubiquity of digital piracy – because people generally place a lower value on digital products (even when they see the production costs as the same physical) it follows that many of us consider the theft of digital products as less serious than physical theft.</p>

<p>The secret to finding a single drug treatment for neurodegenerative conditions may lie in unfolding the mystery of misfolded proteins. Most of the non-infectious neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) are characterized by progressive death of neurons due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in brain cells.</p>
<p>To understand the pathogenesis of these diseases we have to first understand proteins.  They are essential for building our body structures and functional regulation. Thus, there are thousands of different proteins with various functions. These proteins are made up of only 20 amino acids. These 20 amino acids are like the alphabet in a language, they can create thousands or millions of proteins when used in different combinations. A single misplaced letter in a word results in a spelling error. Similarly, a misplaced amino acid can create the wrong kind of protein. Misplaced words can create a grammatically wrong and incomprehensible sentence. In a similar fashion, misfolded proteins have no structural or functional value.</p>
<p>Another important concept that has to be understood is how <em>prions</em> are involved. From school books, we know that infections are caused by microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses. All of them have genetic material in the form of nucleic acids (as DNA or RNA, or both), that is essential for the reproduction or multiplication of these microorganisms. But prions, unlike microorganisms, are just protein chains that are infectious. These proteins, after entering the living organism, cause misfolding of proteinaceous infectious particles (PrPs). PrPs are found in all of us, our brain and neurons are especially rich in them. Their role, however, is still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Misfolded PrPs cause encephalopathies. These misfolded proteins are also thought to cause a chain reaction resulting in the misfolding of other proteins. These misfolded proteins propagate further like an infectious microorganism. What causes this chain reaction and propagation is still unclear. These chains of proteins are called prions. They cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. Prions have a long incubation period, it takes a long time for the disease to appear and progress.</p>
<p>In many neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, misfolded proteins get progressively accumulated in brain cells, leading to the death of neurons. There is growing evidence that the prion-like process of <em>seeding</em> and <em>templated protein corruption</em> are behind the progression of these diseases.</p>
<p>PrP (healthy prion) is commonly found in our brain cells. However, when a defective prion protein is somehow introduced into the cells, it causes misfolding of newly forming PrP. This process is progressive and propagated like an infectious disease to the other cells. Thus, one of the potential treatment approaches is to block the propagation of this prion-like protein.</p>
<p>Accumulation of these prion-like misfolded, mutant proteins is toxic for cells. The prolonged toxic stress produced in brain cells induces specific death pathways. Understanding how these toxic proteins cause stress for neurons and why the cells die could also help to find new treatment strategies.</p>
<p>With increasing evidence that prion-like mechanisms are behind the progression and propagation of most neurodegenerative disorders, scientists have started looking for methods to stop this propagation. One such method is the use of specific immunotherapy, where researchers are trying to develop vaccines that can cure these disorders, or at least stop disease progression.</p>
<p>Larger proteins in our body contain hundreds or thousands of amino acids in various combinations. These large proteins are folded into specific structures. If a protein is misfolded, it loses its specific structure too. It also loses its properties and becomes toxic for cells. One therapeutic approach aims to develop a vaccine that can activate our immune system (B and T cells) against these defective misfolded proteins so that they are destroyed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>To achieve this aim, scientist have tried two methods. One of them is to create a vaccine that works against very short chains of misfolded proteins called monomers. They exist while these proteins are being assembled. Another approach is to target the fully formed misfolded protein fibrils. However, both of these methods have so far failed to produce the intended results.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers are exploring a new strategy for the development of immunotherapy against these diseases. This strategy targets so-called “oligomers”. The oligomers are molecular intermediates that exist in the process of assembling the prion fibrils. They are not very small like monomers (initial building blocks of prions) and are also not fully formed prion fibrils.</p>
<p>Smaller monomers lack the antigenic properties (associated with protein structures called beta-sheets) of misfolded proteins that are needed for an immune response. Meanwhile, fully formed fibrils are too big to propagate through cell walls. Thus, it is quite possible that these oligomers play a critical role in the disease propagation processes. A vaccine or immunotherapy targeting these oligomers could be more effective in initiating an immune response against the misfolded pathological prions than their smaller or larger counterparts. Moreover, these intermediate oligomers are common to most neurodegenerative disorders, unlike fully formed fibrils that are specific to each disease.</p>
<p>Although this new approach has shown some success in animal models, there are several challenges to using such immunotherapy in humans. In humans, it is not easy to initiate the immune response because of “self-tolerance.” The misfolded proteins are very similar to normal proteins (normal PrPs). Even if this immune tolerance can be overcome, there is a risk of initiating the wrong kind of immune response against normal proteins. This may lead to sterile encephalopathy or another kind of damage. Further, the blood-brain barrier also poses a challenge: it is important that antibodies created by a vaccine are able to reach a good concentration in the brain.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the idea of having just a single approach to treat all (or at least most) types of neurodegeneration is clearly exciting. These diseases have lots in common in terms of the molecular mechanisms involved, and it is quite likely that immunotherapy targeting all of them can be developed.</p>

New findings suggest we weigh popular and expert opinion intuitively</figure>
<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Imagine contemplating which treatment to undertake for a health problem. Your specialist explains there are two possibilities, and strongly endorses one as right for you. But when you discuss it with a friend, she suggests that based on what she’s heard, the other would be better. Another friend, the same. And another. Does there come a point where the friends outweigh the expert? Given enough information – the accuracy of the expert in the past, the degree to which the public have any insight on the issue – you can in theory mathematically “solve” this issue with a probabilistic model. In fact, according to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2017.1378721">new research</a> published in <i>Thinking and Reasoning</i>, that’s exactly what we do intuitively and with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p><span id="more-31252"></span></p>
<p>In a collaboration between Radboud University Nijmegen and University College London, Jos Hornikx’s team asked 146 Dutch adults, most commonly educated to graduate level with an average age of 31, to evaluate five scenarios each involving a public policy decision such as whether to create car-free zones in a city and whether it would impact the number of shop customers. In each scenario, an expert (in this case, a professor of retail marketing) had given a recommendation for or against the proposal, and participants were told their track record – e.g. they had been correct in 80 per cent of previous zoning decisions.</p>
<p>Each participant was also told that a subset of the public – for example, local road workers (with no formal training in the topic) – had disagreed with the expert view. Participants were told how much these non-experts had insight into the relevant issues – this varied from participant to participant, with some told the non-experts had been correct only 51 per cent of the time, others as high as 60 per cent. Participants were then asked how many non-experts would need to hold a dissenting view to outweigh the single expert.</p>
<p>The team made a probability model using Bayes’ theorem of belief revision: this shows how much you should shift your initial opinion in the face of new contradictory information. In the current context, the model showed exactly what volume of laypeople should be seen as a counterpoint to an expert, at each of the degrees of accuracy. The researchers evaluated whether human intuition came close to this. It turns out it does.</p>
<p>For instance, in the zoning situation, participants judged that when lay people had only the barest insight – they’d been right just 51 per cent of the time in the past – you would need a group of 40 expressing the same shared opinion to counter a single expert (with an 80 per cent accuracy record) – a judgment that’s in the ballpark of what the statistical model recommended. When the lay group were said to be more accurate, at 55 per cent or 60 per cent, participants judged that just ten in agreement would outweigh the expert – again, in line with the ideal model. The only place where participants really deviated from the ideal was in a scenario where the expert was suggested to have extremely high accuracy (99.99 per cent), which theoretically outmatches even a few hundred low-insight laypeople. The participants imagined that 50 non-experts would be enough to outweigh an expert in this case, suggesting it’s hard for us to process these high-number levels.</p>
<p>The findings suggest we should stop talking about the public and experts as if we have to put our faith in one or the other. Given reasonable context and space to think, we can weigh both in our judgments. It may be rhetorically convenient for advocates to trash experts, or poor scorn on the public, but we can sidestep those claims, to draw on both everyday and specialised wisdom to inform our decisions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/6zPSK286mQU/nature24284">Association analysis identifies 65 new breast cancer risk loci</a></h4>

<p>
 Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P &lt; 5 × 10−8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements, and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2–5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.

<p>
 Locomotion is a universal behaviour that provides animals with the ability to move between places. Classical experiments have used electrical microstimulation to identify brain regions that promote locomotion, but the identity of neurons that act as key intermediaries between higher motor planning centres and executive circuits in the spinal cord has remained controversial. Here we show that the mouse caudal brainstem encompasses functionally heterogeneous neuronal subpopulations that have differential effects on locomotion. These subpopulations are distinguishable by location, neurotransmitter identity and connectivity. Notably, glutamatergic neurons within the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi), a small subregion in the caudal brainstem, are essential to support high-speed locomotion, and can positively tune locomotor speed through inputs from glutamatergic neurons of the upstream midbrain locomotor region. By contrast, glycinergic inhibitory neurons can induce different forms of behavioural arrest mapping onto distinct caudal brainstem regions. Anatomically, descending pathways of glutamatergic and glycinergic LPGi subpopulations communicate with distinct effector circuits in the spinal cord. Our results reveal that behaviourally opposing locomotor functions in the caudal brainstem were historically masked by the unexposed diversity of intermingled neuronal subpopulations. We demonstrate how specific brainstem neuron populations represent essential substrates to implement key parameters in the execution of motor programs.

However, I don't think the paper is very smart.

Back in May I discussed a paper published in PNAS which, I claimed, was using scientific terminology in a sloppy way. The authors, Pearce et al., used the word "neuropeptides" to refer to six molecules, but three of them weren't neuropeptides at all. The authors acknowledged this minor error and issued a correction.



Now, it emerges that there may be more serious problems with the PNAS paper. In a letter published last week, researchers Patrick Jern and colleagues say that the statistics u

<p>Will you get a better result from a business negotiation if you get angry or remain calm? What about a creative task – will you come up with more solutions to a problem if you’re excited, or relaxed?</p>
<p>The answer, according a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-29279-001">new study</a> in <i>Emotion</i>, is that it depends at least in part on what you <i>expect </i>the impacts of emotions to be.</p>
<p>Some theories linking emotion and behaviour hold that emotions activate fixed behavioural “programmes” (anger activates aggressive actions, for example). Others hold that while emotions do influence behaviour, how they do so depends upon the individual’s past experiences, and the current context. (Faced with a bullying boss, the anger you feel may lead you respond aggressively, if this has worked for you in the past; alternatively, it may prompt you to go off and strengthen bonds with colleagues.)</p>
<p>Maya Tamir and Yochanan Bigman at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, reasoned that if this second class of theory is correct, a given emotion will lead to a particular behaviour if a person expects it to do so – but if that expectation is not there, it won’t.</p>
<p><span id="more-31283"></span></p>
<p>For the first experiment, the researchers told volunteers that, as part of a study on peer influence, they would be completing a real negotiation task, with financial consequences. The negotiation was over the sharing of coloured chips. Each participant was given a table showing the monetary value of the chips, but they were also told that the other person’s table may not show the same values.</p>
<p>Before going into the negotiation, half were assigned to an “angry” condition. They read testimonials purporting to be from people who had previously been successful at the negotiation task that included comments like, “Throughout the negotiation, I was persistent. Eventually I got angry and my partner felt compelled to give me what I wanted.” They also listened to “angry” music (music rated in a pilot study as inducing feelings of anger), such as <i>Inquisition</i> by the cello metal – yes, cello metal – band <i>Apocalyptica</i>. The control group read testimonials that did not mention emotions, but recommended being “reasonable”. They listened to music deemed to be emotionally neutral. Finally, the volunteers described their current emotional state, then went into the negotiation.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the volunteers who said they felt angry made more money, but only <i>if </i>they’d read the testimonials advocating the benefits of anger, not if they hadn’t. Those who’d read the emotionally neutral testimonials did equally well, whether they felt angry or not.</p>
<p>In another experiment, Tamir and Bigman recruited 159 more students, to look at how expectations about anger might affect performance on a first-person shooter video game.  Half the group was led to believe, via accounts from previous players, that feeling angry would help them kill more baddies, while the other half was led to believe that feeling calm would be beneficial. Those who expected anger to boost their performance played better if they actually felt angry, rather than relatively calm; in contrast, angry participants in the “calm is good” condition didn’t show this advantage. However, against the researchers’ expectations, feeling calm didn’t help the ‘calm is good’ group perhaps because in this context, the lower physiological arousal associated with calmness is a disadvantage, regardless of beliefs.</p>
<p>For the final study, the researchers switched to creativity. Among people who were encouraged to believe that excitement benefits creativity, those who reported feeling excited did better (as measured by how many uses they could come up with for a brick) than those who reported feeling calm. In contrast, among the “calm is good” group, those who felt calm performed better than those who felt more excited – showing that there are contexts where a low arousal state can be advantageous if you believe it to be so.</p>
<p>Clearly, more work is needed to explore just what types of performance can be influenced by expectations about the impacts of emotions, and actual emotional states. But this work does show that, as the researchers conclude, “At least in some cases, what we expect emotions to do may determine what they actually do.”</p>
