<p>Founded three decades ago, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> is now home to more than 2 million open access scholarly articles by researchers in disciplines ranging from computer science to economics.</p>
<p>With its ambitious mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, and emerging science, arXiv’s popularity has continued to grow in recent years. In fact, in many fields of mathematics and physics, the majority of scientific papers are posted on arXiv prior to their publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>arXiv is hosted at Cornell University, with financial support from the Simons Foundation, other donors, and more than 200 <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">member institutions</a>.</p>
<p>New among the membership benefits that all institutions receive, is access to a personalized digital dashboard, containing an overview of the articles their researchers have posted on the platform. This is the first time submission data by institution &#8212; including subject category breakdown – has been offered to arXiv members.</p>
<p>To provide this information, arXiv is partnering with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/home.uri">Scopus</a> to optimize that publication data and increase institution’s visibility of their researcher contributions.</p>
<p>Updated annually, the dashboards will help institutions build a more holistic picture of the research activities taking place across their campuses. Institutions will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time.</p>
<p>For institutions, particularly librarians, this level of detail and transparency has multiple benefits. The insights can be used to understand and report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. They can also be used to inform future planning. Importantly, arXiv helps institutions fulfill their mission of expanding access to scholarship.</p>
<p>Alison Fromme, arXiv’s Community Engagement Manager commented: &#8220;Our member institutions value learning about their contributions to arXiv. It helps them understand how their researchers are contributing to the world of research, and how their institutions are contributing to the wider body of scholarly knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsevier’s Iana Tsandev, Director of Product Management, commented: “The quality, breadth and reliability of Scopus data, combined with its transparent structure, has already seen some of the world’s leading university ranking organizations use Scopus data in their calculations. We are really delighted that we now have this opportunity to share our data with arXiv for this important project valuable collaboration.”</p>

<h2><strong>Submission Data FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What usage data is available publicly?</strong></p>
<p>Worldwide submission rank by organization is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2021_institution_submissions">here</a> (3-year average rank, 2019-2021). Other publicly available data and information can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can I find my institution’s submission statistics?</strong></p>
<p>Submission statistics are available to the member representatives of active arXiv member institutions and consortia. Emails with password protected links will be sent to each member representative by the end of April 2022. If you are a member representative at an active member organization and you did not receive your link, please contact <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>. Not a member yet? <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">Learn about membership here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where does this data originate? </strong></p>
<p>Submission data by institution was provided by <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus">Scopus</a>, the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier, extracting and disambiguating author and organization metadata from articles. Our member dashboards were created by connecting disambiguated authors and organizations to arXiv subject areas.</p>
<p><strong>I notice my institution’s submission data is different from the data released in 2020. Why?</strong></p>
<p>Last year’s submission count data was based on a different data source, Microsoft Academic Graph. When the service was discontinued in 2021, we collaborated with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/home.uri">Scopus</a> to use their submission count.</p>
<p><strong>Can I see a list of papers submitted by authors from my institution?</strong></p>
<p>At this time, this information is only available to Champion members. To learn more about becoming a Champion member, please see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">membership information</a> or contact <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a></p>
<p><strong>Are download statistics for my institution available?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv provides <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">general download counts</a> but no longer provides download statistics by institution. This decision was made in collaboration with the Member Advisory Board after careful consideration. Like many people around the world, arXiv readers and authors began working from home during the pandemic – so download statistics by institution, formerly estimated by institutions’ IP addresses, no longer represented the full value institutions gain from arXiv. At the same time, our members began asking for submission statistics, and our collaboration with Scopus enabled us to provide that information in a cost effective manner. Submission statistics help provide a snapshot of arXiv’s value to institutions. Of course, arXiv’s true value to the research community remains incalculable!</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>We don&#8217;t currently have a way of actively communicating with the <span class="caps">WG</span> membership because we don&#8217;t have a mailing list sort of thing where any announcements go straight to the members&#8217; inboxes (we don&#8217;t even have all your e-mails because we decided not to use mailing lists when we&nbsp;started).</li>
<li>The worry, however, is that using GitHub tickets/discussions is passive&#8212;-i.e., folks do get notifications, but they still need to come up to the repository to&nbsp;engage.</li>
<li>The lack of something like a mailing list also means that we don&#8217;t have a way of actively informing the community (outside our membership) of our&nbsp;activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do we need a better way of keeping the wg membership in the loop? Are you satisfied with our current way of doing&nbsp;things?</li>
<li>Are fixed meeting slots working? (we&#8217;ve had a lower than usual turnout recently&#8212;-what can we do to help more of our members attend&nbsp;meetings?)</li>
</ul>
<p>For communicating with the research&nbsp;community:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Should we send more updates to the already existing mailing lists (for example, should a note of our meeting be sent&nbsp;there?)</li>
<li>Or do we need a new mailing list/newsletter setup that folks can subscribe to? (in case our frequent posts to already existing mailing lists are thought to be an abuse of their&nbsp;policies?)</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-medication-new-drugs-research-clinical-trials">Why taking medications during pregnancy is so confusing</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Obstetrician Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman was treating patients in New York City when the COVID-19 pandemic swept in. Hospitals began filling up. Some of her pregnant patients were among the sick.</p>



<p>It was a terrifying time. Little was known about the virus called SARS-CoV-2 to begin with, much less how it might affect a pregnancy, so doctors had to make tough calls. Gyamfi-Bannerman remembers doctors getting waivers to administer the antiviral drug remdesivir to pregnant COVID-19 patients, for instance, even though the drug hadn’t been tested during pregnancy.</p>



<p>“Our goal is to help the mom,” she says. “If we had something that might save her life — or she might die — we were 100 percent using all of those medications.”</p>





<p>These life-or-death decisions were very familiar to obstetricians even before the pandemic. Pregnant women have long been excluded from most drug testing to avoid risk to the fetus. As a result, there’s little data on whether many medications are safe to take while pregnant. This means tough choices for the roughly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793635/">80 percent of women</a> who will take at least one medication during pregnancy. Some have serious conditions that can be dangerous for both mother and fetus if left untreated, like high blood pressure or diabetes.</p>



<p>“Pregnant women are essentially like everybody else,” Gyamfi-Bannerman says. They have the same underlying conditions, requiring the same drugs. In a 2013 study, the top 20 prescriptions taken during the first trimester included <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996804/">antibiotics, asthma and allergy drugs, metformin for diabetes, and antidepressants</a>. Yet even for common drugs, the only advice available if you’re pregnant is “talk to your doctor.” With no data, doctors don’t have the answers either.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating to many doctors and researchers is that this lack of information is by design. Even the later stages of most clinical trials, which test a new drug’s safety and efficacy in people, specifically exclude pregnant people to avoid risk to the fetus. But in the wake of a pandemic that disproportionately harmed the pregnant population, researchers are questioning more than ever whether this is the best approach.</p>



<p>Typically, researchers have to justify excluding certain groups, such as older adults, from clinical trials in which they might benefit. “You never have to justify why you’re excluding pregnant people,” says Gyamfi-Bannerman, who now heads the obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science department at the University of California, San Diego. “You can just go ahead and exclude them.</p>



<p>“The exclusion of pregnant people in clinical trials is a huge, historic problem,” she says, “and it really came to light with COVID.”</p>



<h4>Pregnant in a crisis</h4>



<p>Teresa Mathews was 43 years old when she found out she was pregnant in June 2020, just as the pandemic was tearing across the United States. “I was really worried,” she says. In addition to her age as a risk factor, Mathews has sickle cell trait, meaning she carries one defective gene copy that makes her prone to anemia and shortness of breath. COVID-19 also causes shortness of breath, so Mathews feared her unborn child could starve for oxygen if she caught the virus.</p>



<p>What’s more, the baby would be her first. “I don’t want to say it melodramatically, but it was my last chance of having a baby, right? So I didn’t really want to take chances.” She went into full lockdown for the rest of her pregnancy.</p>



<p>For good reason. A study during the pandemic’s first year in England found that pregnant women who got the virus were about <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00565-2/fulltext">twice as likely to have a stillbirth or early birth</a>. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in November 2020 that pregnant women are about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/being-pregnant-unvaccinated-against-covid-19-risky">three times as likely as other women to land in intensive care with COVID-19</a>, and 70 percent more likely to die from the infection (<em>SN Online: 2/7/22</em>).</p>

<p>Shown are admissions to hospital intensive care units during the pandemic. Unvaccinated pregnant women are about three times as likely as pregnant women who’ve been vaccinated to require intensive care for COVID-19. </p>

<p>So when the race for a vaccine began, many doctors and officials hoped that vaccines would be tested in pregnant women and shown to be safe. There were promising signs: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download">encouraged</a> vaccine developers to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/global-regulators-envision-paradigm-shift-toward-inclusion-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-clinical">include pregnant women in their trials</a>. A large body of previous research suggested that risks would be low for vaccines like those for COVID-19, which do not contain live viruses.</p>



<p>But ultimately the three vaccines that the FDA cleared for use in the United States, from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson, excluded pregnant people from their initial clinical trials. After its vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December 2020, Pfizer began enrolling pregnant women for a clinical trial but called it off when federal officials recommended that all pregnant women get vaccinated. The company cited challenges with enrolling enough women for the trial, as well as ethical considerations in giving a placebo to pregnant individuals once the vaccine was recommended.</p>



<p>When pregnant people were excluded from vaccine trials, doctors knew it would be difficult to convince pregnant patients to take a vaccine that hadn’t been tested during pregnancy.</p>



<p>Mathews says she would have been willing to get vaccinated while pregnant if there had been data to support the decision. But the choice was made for her. Her daughter, Eulalia, was born healthy in February 2021, shortly before the vaccines became available to all adults in Mathews’ hometown of Knoxville, Tenn. At that point, there was still no clear guidance on whether to get vaccinated while pregnant or nursing.</p>





<p>Officials at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., were worried about that lack of direction. Diana Bianchi, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, called for <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776540">more COVID-19 vaccine research in the pregnant population</a> in a February 2021 commentary in <em>JAMA</em>. She wrote, “Pregnant people and their clinicians must make real-time decisions based on little or no scientific evidence.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, social media and pregnancy websites filled the void with conspiracy theories and scary stories about vaccines causing infertility or miscarriages. Alarmed, the <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/10/covid-19-vaccination-pregnancy-medical-misinformation-how-you-can-help">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warned last October</a> that “the spread of misinformation and mistrust in doctors and science is contributing to staggeringly low vaccination rates among pregnant people.”</p>



<p>Indeed, the CDC had issued an urgent health advisory the month before warning that only <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-pregnant-women">31 percent of pregnant people were fully vaccinated</a>, compared with about <a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/">56 percent of the general population</a>. (CDC and many experts favor “pregnant people” as a general term. <em>Science News </em>is following the language used by sources, and refers to pregnant women when a study population was designated as such.)</p>



<p>“Every week, I look at the number of pregnant people who have died due to COVID. Right now, the most recent statistic is 257 deaths,” Bianchi said in January. “I look at that and I say, that was a preventable statistic.”</p>



<p>After the vaccines received emergency use authorization, the CDC analyzed the outcomes for nearly 2,500 vaccinated pregnant people and found no safety concerns related to pregnancy. The agency <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0811-vaccine-safe-pregnant.html">recommended vaccination for anyone who is pregnant, lactating or considering becoming pregnant</a>. But that recommendation arrived more than six months after the first vaccine became available.</p>

</div>



<p>Since then, the vaccines have also proved to be highly effective in pregnancy. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2">More than 98 percent of COVID-19 critical care admissions in a group of more than 130,000 pregnant women in Scotland were unvaccinated</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. And all of the infants who died had unvaccinated moms.</p>



<p>“The story of COVID is yet another cautionary tale,” says Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist. “It highlighted what we’re up against.” Researchers have an ethical duty, she says, not only to protect fetuses from the potential risks of research, but also to ensure that “the drugs that go on the market are safe and effective for all the people who will take them.”</p>



<h4>Good intentions</h4>



<p>Increasingly, scientists are questioning what Gyamfi-Bannerman calls a “knee-jerk” tendency to exclude pregnant individuals from clinical trials. In 2009, Lyerly and colleagues formed the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2">Second Wave Initiative</a> to promote ethical ways to include pregnant women in research. As their ideas have spread, more researchers — <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747530/">mostly women — have held conferences and spearheaded research</a>. Collectively, they’re pushing back on the prevailing culture “that pregnant people need to be protected<em> from</em> research instead of protected <em>through </em>research,” Bianchi says.</p>



<p>“We got here with good intentions,” says Brookie Best, a clinical pharmacologist at UC San Diego who studies medication use among pregnant people. “There were some terrible, terrible tragedies of pregnant people taking a drug and having bad outcomes.”</p>



<p>The most famous of these was thalidomide. Starting in the late 1950s, the drug was prescribed for morning sickness, but it had never been tested in pregnant people. By the early 1960s, it became clear that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/deformed-babies-born-result-sedative">caused birth defects including missing or malformed limbs</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/62, p. 22</em>). Afterward, drug companies were reluctant to take on the risk, or legal liability, of potential birth defects. While the FDA enacted new safety rules in response to the thalidomide disaster, the agency did not require testing during pregnancy before drugs went to market.</p>



<p>In 1977, the FDA recommended the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history">exclusion of all women of childbearing age from the first two phases of clinical trials</a>. When the U.S. Congress passed a bill in 1993 requiring that women and minorities be included in clinical research, the requirement did not extend to pregnant women.</p>

<p>Some scientists still see plenty of good reasons not to include pregnant women in clinical trials. For example, reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan has seen unexpected health effects crop up long after substances were deemed safe. With that in mind, Swan, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, says that observational studies that follow women and their children after a drug has been approved remain the best approach. These studies are “expensive, and very slow,” she admits, but safer.</p>



<p>For decades, that level of precaution has extended to essentially all medications. As a result, the reproductive effects of a medicine aren’t usually discovered until long after a drug enters the market. Even then, such research is not required for most new drugs, so doctors and researchers must take the initiative. Typically, this happens through pregnancy registries, which enroll pregnant volunteers who are taking a particular drug and follow them throughout pregnancy or beyond.</p>



<p>But voluntary registries leave huge data gaps. A 2011 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajmg.c.30313">review of 172 drugs approved by the FDA in the preceding decade</a> found that the risk of harm to fetal development was “undetermined” for 98 percent of them, and for 73 percent there was no safety data during pregnancy at all.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean all those drugs are dangerous. Relatively few drugs cause major birth defects, and many of those fall into known classes. For example, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20060607/ace-inhibitors-may-boost-birth-defects">ACE inhibitors used to control blood pressure have been linked to a range of issues</a>, including kidney and cardiovascular problems in infants, when taken during pregnancy. But the potential for more subtle, long-term effects has been trickier to tease out.</p>



<p>For instance, several studies in the 2010s reported links between mothers taking antidepressants during pregnancy and their kids having developmental problems like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Some moms became afraid to treat their own depression. But in 2017, studies of siblings <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/autism-adhd-risk-not-linked-prenatal-exposure-antidepressants">found no difference</a> in these conditions among children who had been exposed to antidepressants in the womb and those who had not (<em>SN: 5/13/17, p. 9</em>). More likely, the problem was the depression the mom was experiencing, the studies suggested, not the drugs.</p>



<h4>No legal requirement</h4>



<p>How the contents of a pregnant woman’s medicine cabinet might affect her child depends on a host of factors, including how the drug works and whether it crosses the placenta. The main way to gauge whether a drug may harm a fetus is through animal studies called developmental and reproductive toxicology, or DART, studies. But drug companies often don’t begin these studies until they’ve already gotten clinical trials rolling.</p>



<p>This creates a catch-22, because clinical trials can’t include pregnant people until DART studies suggest it’s safe to do so. That’s why Lyerly and others pushing for change say that pharmaceutical companies should start doing these studies earlier, before clinical trials begin.</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/112195/download">the FDA issued draft guidance</a> to help the pharmaceutical industry decide <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/finally-plan-how-include-pregnant-women-clinical-trials">how and when to include pregnant people in clinical trials</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/30/18</em>). That guidance is an encouraging first step, Lyerly says, but it didn’t change any of the stringent rules for when pregnant people could be included in research.</p>



<p>Plus, it’s all completely voluntary, says Leyla Sahin, acting deputy director for safety in FDA’s Division of Pediatric and Maternal Health. “We advise industry…. We tell them we recommend that you include pregnant women in your clinical trials,” Sahin says. “But there’s no requirement.”</p>



<p>In fact, the FDA doesn’t even have the legal authority to create a requirement. In that sense, Sahin says, “we’re where pediatrics was 20 years ago.” Until Congress passed the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, children were routinely excluded from clinical trials just as pregnant women are now. The pediatric law required drug companies to gather data on the safety and effectiveness of medications in children and to provide FDA an appropriate plan for pediatric studies.</p>



<p>Congress could pass a similar law for pregnancy. And in 2020, a government task force recommended exactly that to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees FDA. But “it’s almost like it’s gone into this black hole,” Sahin says. “We haven’t heard from HHS. We haven’t heard from Congress.”</p>

<h4>Stocking the medicine cabinet</h4>



<p>Until clinical trials during pregnancy become more routine, pregnant people face an untenable choice — take a drug without knowing its safety, or leave their medical conditions untreated.</p>



<p>Case in point: A group of 91 doctors and scientists published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ s41574-021-00553-7">consensus statement</a> in September 2021 in <em>Nature Reviews Endocrinology</em> warning that acetaminophen, the most commonly used drug during pregnancy, may harm fetal development. Research suggests the drug disrupts hormones, with effects ranging from undescended testicles in male infants to an increased risk of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder in boys and girls.</p>



<p>But as is often the case with drugs and pregnancy, there’s not exactly a consensus among doctors about what pregnant people should do. In response to the new paper, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/09/response-to-consensus-statement-on-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy">statement saying the evidence wasn’t strong enough</a> to suggest doctors should change their standard practice, which is to recommend acetaminophen be taken as needed and in moderation.</p>



<p>Acetaminophen is an active ingredient in more than 600 medications, including Tylenol, and is estimated to be used by up to 65 percent of pregnant people in the United States. It has long been the preferred pain medication and fever reducer during pregnancy because the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-recommends-avoiding-use-nsaids-pregnancy-20-weeks-or-later-because-they-can-result-low-amniotic">FDA recommends against the anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs</a> — such as ibuprofen and aspirin — in the second half of pregnancy. Those drugs have been linked to rare fetal kidney problems and low amniotic fluid levels.</p>



<p>While at the University of Copenhagen, clinical pharmacologist David Kristensen began studying acetaminophen’s effects on fetal development after noticing that the drug is structurally similar to chemicals that disrupt hormones. In 2011, he and colleagues published animal and human studies linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21059752/">with concerning effects in infants</a>, including undescended testicles.</p>



<p>“My ears perked up when I heard that,” says Swan, the Mount Sinai reproductive epidemiologist and coauthor of the 2021 acetaminophen review. She had seen similar effects with maternal exposure to phthalates, chemicals used in plastics that are known to alter the activity of hormones needed to regulate fetal development.</p>



<p>She and colleagues surveyed 25 years of acetaminophen studies. The group found that five out of 11 relevant studies linked prenatal acetaminophen use to urogenital and reproductive tract abnormalities in children, and 26 out of 29 epidemiological studies linked fetal exposure to acetaminophen with neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems. The strength of these links varied, but were “generally modest,” the authors wrote.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at subtle effects here,” Swan says, “but that doesn’t mean that they’re not important.” With such widespread use, “there’s a good chance that a fair number of offspring are affected.”</p>



<p>Although Swan is wary of testing new drugs in pregnant women, she would like to see better research on medications during pregnancy. “There’s a whole range of options short of doing human study,” she says.</p>



<p>To start with, Swan says, scientists need better data on what medications pregnant women are taking, and how much. That means more studies should ask women to keep daily logs of every pill they take. Researchers can also do more studies of drugs’ reproductive effects in animals, she notes, and even transplant human tissues such as brain, liver or gonads into animals to learn how they respond to drugs.</p>



<h4>Not the same vulnerability</h4>



<p>The cultural shift around pregnancy research may be gaining momentum.</p>



<p>Government-funded research is one key area for change. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established an interagency task force on research specific to pregnant and lactating women. It included officials from NIH, CDC and FDA, as well as medical societies and industry. <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/advisory/PRGLAC/recommendations">One of the task force’s recommendations was acted upon in 2018</a>: removing pregnant women as a “vulnerable” group in a federal regulation called the Common Rule, which governs federally funded research. Pregnant women had been listed along with children, prisoners and people with intellectual disabilities as vulnerable and thus requiring special protections if included in research.</p>



<p>Unlike the other groups in that list, pregnant people “don’t have a diminished capacity to provide informed consent,” says Lyerly, the bioethicist at the University of North Carolina. That rule change alone could help “change the culture of research.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, researchers are forging ahead with studies on many drugs used during pregnancy. <a href="https://mtnstopshiv.org/news/studies/mtn042">HIV drugs are among the most studied</a>, says Best of UC San Diego, in part because the virus can pass from pregnant women to their fetuses. “So right off the bat, everybody knew that we needed to treat these [pregnant] patients with medication,” she says. Yet data on HIV drugs during pregnancy lagged as much as 12 years after FDA approval.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Waiting game&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Even for HIV drugs, which are better studied during pregnancy than most drugs, it took an average of six years after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval before the first data were published on a drug’s activity during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Many pregnant women appear to be willing to participate in research. More than 18,000 pregnant people had enrolled in the COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registry as of March, and every year <a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/womens-health-research/list-pregnancy-exposure-registries">many volunteer for other pregnancy registries</a>.</p>



<p>Gyamfi-Bannerman says that in her experience, plenty of pregnant patients are willing to volunteer, even for experimental drugs, if there’s potential to benefit from the drug and they will be monitored closely. At Columbia University, she helped lead a clinical trials network called the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network that specifically studies complications during pregnancy. “It’s a very safe and protective environment,” she says.</p>



<p>As for next steps, a few policy changes could make a big difference, Best says, like “getting those preclinical studies done earlier and allowing people who accidentally get pregnant while participating in a clinical trial to make the choice of whether or not to stay.” Right now, “if you get pregnant, you’re out. Boom, that’s it,” she says. “But they were already exposed to the risk, and now they’re not getting the benefit. And so we don’t think that’s actually ethical.”</p>



<p>Thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women to treat morning sickness, without ever having been tested in pregnant women. “We took the wrong lesson from thalidomide,” Lyerly says. “The first lesson of thalidomide is that we <em>should</em> do research, not that we shouldn’t.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Plagiarism and cheating are persistent problems in higher education, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922000678">new paper</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences. </em>Better ways of combatting academic misconduct are clearly needed. And in their paper, Guy J. Curtis at the University of Western Australia and colleagues report that they’ve found one: encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their own learning.</p>



<span id="more-46033"></span>



<p>Recent work has consistently linked various forms of cheating to higher scores on the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/15/understanding-bad-character-research-into-the-dark-triad-digested/">&#8220;Dark Triad&#8221; personality traits of psychopathy, Macchiavelianism and narcissism</a>, and also to stronger feelings of &#8220;academic entitlement&#8221;. Academically entitled students believe that they deserve special or better treatment than is typically given to others. As the researchers explain, this can involve a number of distinctly unappealing beliefs: that the student <em>deserves</em> above average grades, no matter what effort they put in; that instructors should be at their beck and call; and that when their assignments are marked, everyday problems should be regarded as reasons to up their grade. (Sound familiar? I can think of a number of academic friends who would immediately agree.)</p>



<p>Work to date has viewed the Dark Triad and academic entitlement as distinct factors that link independently to academic misconduct. But Curtis and his colleagues wondered if Dark Triad traits might in fact drive feelings of academic entitlement, which then drives misconduct. As they write: “Feelings of entitlement may stem from narcissistic perceptions that one should be treated as ‘special’, Machiavellian motivations to ‘get ahead’, or psychopathic disregard for the feelings of others.”</p>



<p>To explore this, they recruited 387 undergraduate students from three universities in Perth. The students completed scales that assessed Dark Triad traits, feelings of academic entitlement, and academic misconduct (they used a five-point scale to report on how regularly they &#8220;used notes during a closed-book exam&#8221;, for example).</p>



<p>As the team expected, they found positive correlations between scores on all three scales. But a deeper analysis of the data revealed that the link between higher scores on each of the Dark Triad traits and academic misconduct was driven by one of two aspects of academic entitlement: &#8220;externalised responsibilities&#8221;. A student who feels this way believes (implicitly or explicitly) that responsibility for learning lies less with them, and more with others. So, for example, if they miss a class, they might feel that it’s their tutor’s responsibility to get them the notes, not their own.</p>



<p>The other aspect of academic entitlement is &#8220;entitled expectations&#8221; — feeling that a professor must be entertaining to be good, or that they deserve lenient grading, for example. Why wasn’t this aspect, too, linked to misconduct? The researchers suggest that students with entitled expectations might think that any failure to meet them justified cheating, but if these expectations are actually being met, that justification isn’t there. In a student’s mind, though, externalised responsibilities might justify cheating no matter how their tutors behave: “If learning, per se, is not seen as the student’s responsibility, then taking shortcuts in assessment, such as cheating, may be considered acceptable,” the team writes.</p>



<p>One note of caution about the results: the students all self-reported their past cheating, plagiarism, and so on. As the team notes, it’s highly likely that they under-reported these behaviours. But that doesn’t change the main thrust of their findings. And they do suggest a potential route to reducing misconduct: if students who score relatively highly on psychopathy, Machiavellianism or narcissism (or all three) can be convinced to take responsibility for their own learning, the link between the Dark Triad and misconduct could be broken. “Our findings suggest that educators and institutions should communicate to students their personal responsibility for their academic success,” the team concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orange-dwarf-stars-radiation-goldilocks-habitable-planets">‘Goldilocks’ stars may pose challenges for any nearby habitable planets</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re an aspiring life-form, you might want to steer clear of planets around orange dwarf stars.</p>



<p>Some astronomers have called these orange suns <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-may-not-be-goldilocks-star">“Goldilocks stars”</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/09</em>). They are dimmer and age more slowly than yellow sunlike stars, thus offering an orbiting planet a more stable climate. But they are brighter and age faster than red dwarfs, which often spew large flares. However, new observations show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15237">orange dwarfs emit lots of ultraviolet light long after birth</a>, potentially endangering planetary atmospheres, researchers report in a paper submitted March 29 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomer Tyler Richey-Yowell and her colleagues examined 39 orange dwarfs. Most are moving together through the Milky Way in two separate groups, either 40 million or 650 million years old.</p>





<p>To Richey-Yowell’s surprise, she and her team found that the ultraviolet flux didn’t drop off from the younger orange stars to the older ones — unlike the case for yellow and red stars. “I was like, `What the heck is going on?’” says Richey-Yowell, of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>In a stroke of luck, another team of researchers supplied part of the answer. As yellow sunlike stars age, they spin more slowly, causing them to be less active and emit less UV radiation. But for orange dwarfs, this steady spin-down stalls when the stars are roughly a billion years old, astronomer Jason Lee Curtis at Columbia University and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>“[Orange] stars are just much more active for a longer time than we thought they were,” Richey-Yowell says. That means these possibly not-so-Goldilocks stars probably maintain high levels of UV light for more than a billion years.</p>



<p>And that puts any potential life-forms inhabiting orbiting planets on notice. Far-ultraviolet light — whose photons, or particles of light, have much more energy than the UV photons that give you vitamin D — tears molecules in a planet’s atmosphere apart. That leaves behind individual atoms and electrically charged atoms and groups of atoms known as ions. Then the star’s wind — its outflow of particles — can carry the ions away, stripping the planet of its air.</p>



<p>But not all hope is lost for aspiring life-forms that have an orange dwarf sun. Prolonged exposure to far-ultraviolet light can stress planets but doesn’t necessarily doom them to be barren, says Ed Guinan, an astronomer at Villanova University in Pennsylvania who was not involved in the new work. “As long as the planet has a strong magnetic field, you’re more or less OK,” he says.</p>



<p>Though far-ultraviolet light splits water and other molecules in a planet’s atmosphere, the star’s wind can’t remove the resulting ions if a magnetic field as strong as Earth’s protects them. “That’s why the Earth survived” as a life-bearing world, Guinan says. In contrast, Venus might never have had a magnetic field, and Mars lost its magnetic field early on and most of its air soon after.</p>



<p>“If the planet doesn’t have a magnetic field or has a weak one,” Guinan says, “the game is over.”</p>



<p>What’s needed, Richey-Yowell says, is a study of older orange dwarfs to see exactly when their UV output declines. That will be a challenge, though. The easiest way to find stars of known age is to study a cluster of stars, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hyades-star-cluster-closest-earth-death-throes">most star clusters get ripped apart</a> well before their billionth birthday (<em>SN: 7/24/20</em>). As a result, star clusters somewhat older than this age are rare, which means the nearest examples are distant and harder to observe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-decadal-survey-uranus-enceladus-astrobiology">U.S. planetary scientists want to explore Uranus and Enceladus next</a></h4>

              
                <p>The continuing search for life beyond Earth is driving many of the priorities for what’s next when it comes to U.S. planetary exploration. In a new report that could shape the next 10 years of planetary missions, Mars, Uranus and Saturn’s moon Enceladus have come out on top.</p>



<p>This report is the latest <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26522/origins-worlds-and-life-a-decadal-strategy-for-planetary-science">decadal survey for planetary science and astrobiology</a>. Every 10 years, experts convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine compile a look at the state of the field and pull together a list of recommended priorities for the next decade of exploration. The new survey, which covers 2023 to 2032, will be used by NASA, the National Science Foundation and others to help guide which projects are pursued and funded.</p>



<p>The survey is meant in part &#8220;to identify the key scientific questions that are the most important&#8221; to pursue in the next decade and assess how best to answer them, astrophysicist Robin Canup said April 19 during a news conference after the report was released. Canup, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., is a cochair of the steering committee for the decadal survey.</p>





<p>At the top of the list, the report recommends continuing the Mars sample-return effort by developing a mission that will retrieve, as soon as possible, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">the rock and soil samples that NASA’s Perseverance rover is collecting</a> and storing (<em>SN: 9/10/21</em>). This multipart sample-return mission was also the top priority of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/best-next-space-missions">previous decadal survey</a>, released in 2011 (<em>SN: 3/7/11</em>). Those samples could hold hints of past signs of life on the Red Planet.</p>



<p>The report also suggests that the <em>next </em>Mars mission, after the sample-return one, should look for signs of life in the ice as well as gaseous biosignatures in the atmosphere. That one is farther down the priority list, though.</p>



<p>Next in the line after the Mars sample-return mission is a large, several-billion-dollar mission to send an orbiter and probe to Uranus to explore the planet, its ring system and its moons. Uranus and the solar system’s other ice giant, Neptune, were visited once, in the late 1980s, when Voyager 2 flew by each.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/support-grows-return-ice-giants-uranus-and-neptune">time has come to go back</a>, scientists say (<em>SN: 2/10/16</em>). “I&#8217;m really thrilled to see that they picked a mission to go back and follow up on those incredible discoveries and those wonderful images that Voyager took,” says planetary scientist Linda Spilker of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who was not involved in the decadal survey. Spilker began her career with Voyager.</p>



<p>What’s more, better understanding the ice giants in our solar system could help scientists decipher the mysteries of faraway worlds. In the hunt for planets outside our solar system, the most common type of known exoplanets are those like Neptune and Uranus.</p>



<p>A mission to Uranus “will be transformative,” says planetary scientist Amy Simon of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and a member of the decadal steering committee. “We&#8217;re sure there&#8217;s going to be fantastic discoveries.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>This mission could launch in June 2031 or April 2032, the report suggests. After swinging by Jupiter to use the giant planet’s gravity to fling it faster, the spacecraft would arrive at Uranus 13 years after its launch. Once there, the orbiter would drop a probe in the atmosphere, sampling its composition as never before.</p>



<p>The next highest priority is sending an “orbilander” to Saturn’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">moon Enceladus</a>, a world known to have easily accessible liquid water (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). NASA’s now-defunct Cassini mission discovered in 2005 that this small moon spews geysers of water into space, and more recent research suggests that water <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moons-geysers-draw-water-subsurface-sea">coming from subsurface locales</a> has salts, possibly indicating warm pockets of water interacting with rock — and brewing an environment that may host life (<em>SN: 8/4/14</em>).</p>

<p>This proposed spacecraft would arrive at the moon in the early 2050s, where it would first spend 1.5 years orbiting Enceladus, flying through its watery plumes to sample the liquid. Then the spacecraft would land on the surface for a two-year mission.</p>



<p>“If you want to go and look for life, Enceladus is a very good place to do it,” says planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a member of the decadal steering committee.</p>



<p>Life on other planets isn’t the only thing on planetary scientists’ minds. The report also recommends continuing work on a mission to find and characterize near-Earth objects, like asteroids and comets, in an effort to protect life on the only planet where it’s known to exist.</p>



<p>Two medium-sized missions should be funded in the next decade too, the report recommends. While the survey doesn’t specify targets for these missions, nine higher-priority locales are singled out, including Venus, Saturn’s moon Titan and Neptune’s moon Triton.</p>



<p>The decadal survey also considered the state of the fields of planetary science and astrobiology — namely decreasing funding opportunities and how to improve diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts. For the latter, the committee looked at whether the community has diverse representation through their members.</p>



<p>“The thing that became abundantly clear is that NASA has done a terrible job of collecting those kinds of statistics,” Nimmo says of demographics in planetary science. For now, the recommendation is to better survey the scientific community, he says. &nbsp;“We’re not going to be able to solve anything until we actually have better statistics.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>What makes us vote for particular candidates often goes beyond their politics. Research has suggested that our voting preferences can be influenced by our own <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/08/people-who-view-their-britishness-or-englishness-as-causally-central-to-their-self-concept-more-likely-to-have-voted-for-brexit-study-finds/">self-identity</a>, candidates’ <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727270900142X">perceived beauty</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513811001024">depth of their voices</a>. A new study looks at another factor that could sway our choices: education.</p>



<p>Writing in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, </em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221077794">Jochem van Noord and team find</a> that people with low or high levels of education both prefer more educated politicians — but the reasons for this preference may be different for each group.</p>



<span id="more-46038"></span>



<p><a></a>In the first study, participants with varying levels of education were presented with four fictitious profiles of political candidates. Profiles indicated that candidates either had a masters degree or a high school diploma, and described activities that they had completed during university or school. Candidates were presented as either progressive or conservative.</p>



<p>After reviewing the profiles, participants rated the candidates’ competence, agency, warmth, and morality. They also indicated how likely they were to vote for them and to what extent they felt they identified personally with the candidate.</p>



<p>The results showed that, overall, participants not only viewed higher educated candidates as more competent, but were more likely to vote for them (in fact, the belief that more educated candidates were more competent could partly explain <em>why </em>participants were more likely to vote for them). They also rated these candidates higher on agency and morality.</p>



<p>Participants who themselves were more educated had a particularly strong belief in the higher educated candidates’ competence, and were more likely to vote for them, compared to less educated participants. This may reflect an in-group bias, as these participants also felt a stronger shared identity with higher than lower educated candidates. Lower educated participants identified more with candidates with more conservative political orientations.</p>



<p>If people prefer more educated candidates because they think they are more competent, what happens if a candidate with a lower level of education is portrayed as particularly competent? To find out, in a second study, the team presented some candidates as having extensive previous political experience and some as having none at all.</p>



<p>Again, higher educated candidates were seen as more competent and received higher voting intentions overall. But for less educated participants, candidate education was much less important than candidate <em>competence</em>: these participants didn’t show a preference for more educated candidates, but did prefer more competent candidates. This implies that in the first study, less educated participants didn’t prefer the higher educated candidates because of their educational background per se, but because this background conferred them with a sense of competency, the team argues.</p>



<p>For higher educated candidates, the important factor seemed to be identification. While they preferred competent to non-competent candidates, they also preferred higher over less educated candidates independent of levels of competency, indicating that they were more concerned with being part of an in-group than anything else. </p>



<p>If those of both higher and lower educational backgrounds prefer higher educated candidates, whatever the reason, this poses a question about how to democratise the political sphere. The most influential people in the country are already <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/elitism-in-britain-2019">much more likely</a> to have attended private school and elite universities, and the results from this study are not wholly encouraging when it comes to combatting this.</p>



<p>There may be some hope, however: less educated participants showed a preference for competence rather than education. For political candidates without elite higher education, thinking about ways to demonstrate competence may be key to success.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction and scope of work</strong></p>
<p>I am an ophthalmologist working in the fields of medical retina and uveitis. For the past few years, I have combined clinical and research works which are focused on prevention of vision loss as well as restoration and improvement of vision. Therefore, I see myself working to achieve the SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-being’. As it is well known, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy are the main cause of blindness worldwide, especially in countries where diabetes mellitus is prevalent, such as Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge with inherited retinal diseases</strong></p>
<p>Another visual problem common in the Saudi society are inherited retinal diseases, mainly due to the high consanguinity among Saudis. My research work has been largely focused on inherited retinal diseases and aiming to add to the scientific knowledge about these diseases. The ability to characterize, discover and fully describe the inherited retinal diseases helps in counseling related family members about the risks of having further affected members and the consequences of consanguinity.</p>
<p>Inherited retinal diseases impose significant economic on the healthcare system and the individual levels. On the healthcare system level, the consequences of inherited retinal diseases include the costs of primary, secondary and tertiary ophthalmic care, serial examinations and diagnostic tests. On the individual level, barriers to high quality education and challenges related to employment reflect clearly on the economic status of affected people. These considerations make my work related to SDG 1 which is to &#8220;end poverty in all its forms everywhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges I have encountered during my research include poor knowledge about inherited retinal diseases among Saudi population, limited access to genetic testing, competitive funding, and the need for a well-designated registry or database for inherited retinal diseases. The limited funding for genetic testing and research work, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, has affected considerably research work related to inherited retinal diseases.</p>

<p><strong>The future is promising </strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, I have been involved in a national retinal dystrophy registry at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital (KKESH) which is going to facilitate the research work in this field. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries outside North America and Europe to provide the first food and drug association (FDA) approved treatment for patients with inherited retinal diseases caused by mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> gene which is Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna; Novartis). These successes would not have been made without the continuous support of the Saudi Government and ophthalmology leaders in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, I am proud to have played a role in the recent advances which have been made in ophthalmic health care in Saudi Arabia, through my clinical and research works. More efforts are needed to raise the awareness of the Saudi population about preventable diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and inherited retinal diseases. Simple and cost effective measures include lifestyle modifications and reduction of the rates of consanguinity will greatly help achieving related SDG goals (SDG 1 and SDG 3).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europa-water-shallow-liquid-double-ridges-moon">Europa may have much more shallow liquid water than scientists thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Europa’s frozen surface is covered with distinctive pairs of ridges that straddle troughs of ice. These double ridges are the most common features on the Jovian moon. But scientists don’t yet have a clear idea of how the oddities are created.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of images of a similar set of ridges on Greenland’s ice sheet suggests that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29458-3">relatively shallow water</a> within Europa’s thick icy shell may be behind their formation, scientists report April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. If so, that could mean that Europa has much more shallow liquid water than scientists have thought.</p>



<p>Europa’s double ridge systems, which can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, include some of the oldest features on the moon, says Riley Culberg, a geophysicist at Stanford University. Some researchers have proposed that the flexing of the moon’s icy shell due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-moons-tidal-waves-ganymede-callisto-europa-io">tides in an underlying liquid water ocean</a> plays a role in the ridges’ formation (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Yet others have suggested that water erupted from deep within the icy moon — a process known as cryovolcanism — to create the ridges. Without a closer look, though, it’s been hard to nail down a more solid explanation.</p>





<p>But Culberg and his colleagues seem to have caught a break. Data gathered by NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite in March 2016 showed an 800-meter-long double ridge system in northwestern Greenland. So the team looked back at other images to see when the ridge system first appeared and to assess how it grew. The researchers found that the ridges appeared in images taken as early as July 2013 and are still there today.</p>



<p>When the ridges — which lie on either side of a trough, like those on Europa — reached full size, they averaged only 2.1 meters high. That’s a lot smaller than the ridges on Europa, which can rise 300 meters or more from the moon’s surface. But surface gravity is much lower on Europa, so ridges can grow much larger there, Culberg says. When he and his colleagues considered the difference between Earth’s gravity and Europa’s in their calculations, they found that the proportions of the two ridge systems are consistent.</p>

<p>Scientists will never get a perfect analog of Europa on Earth, but the ridges in Greenland “look just like the Europan ridges,” says Laurent Montési, a geophysicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Data from airplane-mounted radar gathered in March 2016 show that a water-filled layer of snow about 10 to 15 meters below the surface underlies the Greenland ridges, Culberg and his team say. That water comes from surface meltwater that sinks into and is then collected in the buried snow, which in turn sits atop an impermeable layer of ice.</p>



<p>Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of water in that layer of snow would squeeze water toward the surface, the researchers propose. In the first phase of refreezing, a solid plug of ice forms. Then, as more water freezes, it expands and is forced toward the surface on either side of that plug, pushing material upward and producing the double ridges at the surface.</p>



<p>On Europa, the process works the same way, the researchers suggest. But because there is no known meltwater or precipitation at the moon’s surface, near-surface water there probably would have to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/another-hint-europa-watery-plumes-found-20-year-old-galileo-data">the ocean thought to be trapped beneath the moon’s icy shell</a> (<em>5/14/18</em>). Once that water rose toward the surface through cracks, it could pool in thick layers of ice shattered by tidal flexing or the impacts of meteorites.</p>



<p>“There’s a general consensus that these ridges grow from cracks in the ice,” says William McKinnon, a planetary scientist at Washington University in Saint Louis who was not involved in the study. “But <em>how</em> do they do it is the question.”</p>



<p>The answer to that question may not be long in coming, McKinnon says. NASA’s Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in late 2024. If all goes well, the orbiter will arrive at Jupiter in April 2030. “If there’s anything like what has happened in Greenland going on at Europa, we’ll be able to see it,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers will also be interested to see if the mission can ascertain what sort of materials might have been brought to Europa’s surface from the ocean deep below, because the moon is considered to be one of the best places in the solar system <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-oceans-book-search-extraterrestrial-life-outer-solar-system">to look for extraterrestrial life</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jack-in-the-pulpit-plant-flower-sex-lure-pollinator-death">These flowers lure pollinators to their deaths. There’s a new twist on how</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fake — and fatal — invitations to romance could be the newest bit of trickery uncovered among some jack-in-the-pulpit wildflowers.</p>



<p>The fatal part isn’t the surprise. Jack-in-the-pulpits (<em>Arisaema</em>) are the only plants known to kill their own insect pollinators as a matter of routine, says evolutionary ecologist Kenji Suetsugu of Kobe University in Japan. The new twist, if confirmed, would be <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.10261">using sexual deception</a> to woo pollinators into the death traps.</p>



<p>Until now, biologists have found only three plant families with any species that pretend to offer sex to insects, Suetsugu says online March 28 in <em>Plants, People, Planet.</em> But unlike deceit in jack-in-the-pulpits, those other attractions aren’t fatal, just phony.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/promiscuous-orchids">orchid family has turned out multiple cheats</a>, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-local-lady">so seductive</a> that a male insect leaves wasted sperm as well as pollen on a flower. Yet he doesn’t get even a sip of nectar (<em>SN: 3/5/08; SN: 3/27/08</em>). Similar scams have turned up among daisies: A few dark bumps that a human in bad light might mistake for an insect can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sexually-deceived-flies-not-hopelessly-dumb">drive male flies to frenzies</a> on the yellow, orange or red <em>Gorteria</em> petals. Enthusiasm wanes with repeated disappointment though (<em>SN: 1/29/14</em>). And among irises, a species dangles velvety purple petals where deluded insects wallow.</p>

<p>Two jack-in-the-pulpit species in Japan have now raised suspicions that their family, the arums, should be added to the list of sexual cheats. To visually oriented humans, the 180 or so <em>Arisaema</em> species look like just a merry reminder of evolution’s endless weirdness. Some kind of flappy canopy, sometimes striped, bends over a little cupped “pulpit” with a pinkie-tip stub or mushroom bulge of plant flesh peeping over the rim. Below the rim, swaths of flowers open in succession — male blooms overtaken by flowers with female parts — as the plant grows from slim young jack to big mama.</p>



<p>These oddball flowers depend mostly on pollinators that deserve a much bigger fan base: fungus gnats. These gnats, small as punctuation marks and hard to identify, are true flies. But don’t hold that against them. They don’t stalk picnic spreads or buzz-thump against windows. Pollinating gnats “are very frail,” Suetsugu says, and their wings make no noise a human can hear.</p>





<p>Nor can a human always smell what draws fungus gnats. It’s clear, though, that the varied canopied pulpits can have a strong happy hour lure for those cruising pollinators looking to meet the right gnat. This will go terribly wrong.</p>



<p>A tiny escape hatch deep in the trap stays open during the male phase of flowering, but that two-millimeter hole vanishes during the big mama stage. A gnat can’t overcome the slippery, flaking wax of the plant’s inner wall to climb out. &nbsp;So any gnat tricked twice is doomed.</p>



<p>Biologists had assumed that jack-in-the-pulpits seeking fungus gnats were perfuming the air with mushroomy, nice-place-to-have-kids scents. Many kinds seem to do so, but homey smells don’t explain an odd observation by Suetsugu and his colleagues. Of the important pollinator species for two Japanese jack-in-the-pulpits (<em>A. angustatum</em> and <em>A. peninsulae), </em>almost all the specks found in the traps were males.</p>





<p>An odor lure targeting males might mimic a come-hither scent of female gnats, the researchers propose. That’s outright fraud. Even if the hopeful males find a mate in the waxy green dungeon, they and their offspring would starve. They’re stuck in a plant with no fungus to eat. Whatever that ruinous scent is, a human nose can barely detect it, Suetsugu reports.</p>



<p>The notion that biologists have so far overlooked a scent important to other animals seems “more than possible” to Kelsey J.R.P. Byers of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, England. Byers&#8217; work overturned a common assumption that monkeyflowers (<em>Mimulus</em>) had no scent even though hawkmoths, flying at night and known to track odors, visit the flowers.</p>



<p>“We’re such visual creatures,” says Byers, who studies floral scents. We can laugh at how insects mistake some off-color blob of plant tissue for a fabulous female, but we’re missing the odors. Fungus gnats, however, even look like the citizens of a smellier world, with giant guy-style antennae “like an ostrich plume on a hat.”</p>



<p>At least now, modern analytical lab techniques and equipment are opening up the vast sensory world of communication wafting around us. To see if even familiar plants like jack-in-the-pulpits are up to something odd, scientists need to identify the lure itself. Then maybe we’ll understand the irresistible valentine scent of a female fungus gnat.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">Here’s how NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter has spent 1 year on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>One year ago, Ingenuity took its first flight on Mars. And its story since is that of a real-world little helicopter that could.</p>



<p>Ingenuity traveled to the Red Planet attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">both arrived in Jezero crater</a> last February (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). About six weeks later, the helicopter began what was meant to be only a 30-day technology demonstration to see if flight is possible in the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">proved it could fly</a> — and then some (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>). Over the next couple weeks, Ingenuity took four more flights, each time going a bit farther, a bit faster and a bit higher. After those first test flights, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">Ingenuity’s mission morphed</a> from a technology demonstration to operations, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">helping Perseverance traverse the surface</a> by scouting the terrain ahead (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>; <em>SN: 12/10/21</em>).</p>





<p>Before the helicopter arrived, scientists had two perspectives of Mars. “We have pictures taken from orbit around Mars, and then we have pictures taken by rovers driving on the ground,” says planetary scientist Kirsten Siebach of Rice University in Houston, who is not part of the Ingenuity team. “But now this has opened up an entirely new perspective on Mars.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ingenuity has surpassed all expectations. It has shown not only that flight is possible but also what is possible with flight. <em>Science News</em> discussed the helicopter’s big moments, collaboration with the rover and upcoming flights with Håvard Fjær Grip. He’s Ingenuity’s chief pilot and an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. His answers were edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What does the “chief pilot” for a helicopter on another planet do?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> The biggest part of the job is planning the flights. Ingenuity doesn’t know where it is or where it wants to go when it wakes up, so all of those decisions are made here [on Earth]. Every maneuver that the helicopter makes during the flight is planned here on the ground first, and then we uplink the instructions to Ingenuity. When it comes time to fly, it uses its onboard software to follow our instructions as precisely as possible.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Ingenuity has </strong><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Flight-Log"><strong>completed 25 flights</strong></a><strong>. Can you talk about how it’s exceeded expectations?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> It is pretty great. We came there expecting to perform at most five flights within the 30-day window. And all of that was going to happen within in a small area that we carefully selected. We spent weeks figuring out exactly where to place the helicopter, studying these tiny little rocks. Everything was mapped out. And then things went so well when we started flying that almost immediately people started thinking, &#8220;Wow, let’s try to make use of this beyond those five flights.&#8221;</p>



<p>We started this next phase where, to be useful at all, we had to fly away from this carefully selected area. I’m really proud of that. We’ve been able to take this technology that was designed for this very limited mission and extend it to go and land different places on Mars and to travel across terrain that, originally, we had never planned on traveling across.</p>



<p>It’s lasted now for over a year since we deployed it to the surface. I don’t think any of us had imagined that that would be possible.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Have there been any specific flights that have stood out to you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> Obviously, the first flight. That was the most important flight; it still is. We had a more challenging [time on] flight six. It became exciting, because we had an anomaly during the flight.  [A glitch led to navigation images being marked with the wrong time stamps, which caused Ingenuity to sway back and forth during its flight.] Ingenuity had to power through that and survive and get down on the ground in one piece. </p>



<p>We’ve had some flights that have been dedicated to scouting activities. We went to an area where the rover was going to spend several months, and we went ahead of the rover and scouted [it] out so the rover drivers could be more efficient in finding safe ways to drive. Those were flights 12 and 13. Then some of these longer flights have been exciting. Flight No. 9, until a few days ago, was the biggest thing we’d ever done, at [a distance of] 625 meters. And with flight 25, we just beat that and flew more than 700 meters.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: There was a flight recently that had to be postponed because of a dust storm, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> That’s correct. That was flight No. 19. With flying, whether it’s on Mars or here on Earth, you’re worried about weather. We always look at the weather before flying. And every time we’ve done that [on Mars], it had been more or less the same. Then the afternoon before we were about to open flight 19, we were notified that we had a dust storm. That delayed us by quite a bit. When we woke up from that, we had dust on our navigation camera lens, and sand covered our legs partially. We had to fly out of that, and it was a new challenge for the helicopter, but again, it tackled that perfectly.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Ingenuity has flown through two seasons on Mars. As seasons change, so does air pressure. Does that affect the helicopter?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> Yeah, that’s a pretty big deal. We knew, for several years before launch, exactly when we were going to land and where we were going to land. Our design was geared towards the first few months after landing, and that coincided with a particular season [spring] in Jezero crater on Mars. We could [ahead of launch] predict reasonably well what the air density would be. And when we extended [the mission] beyond that, the air density started dropping. To be able to keep flying, we had to increase our rotor speed. In fact, we increased it above anything we tested on Earth. Now we’ve come out of summer, the density has started climbing again, and we’ve been able to go back to our original rotor speed and also extend our flight time.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What comes next? Are there any big flights planned soon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> We’re going to make our way over to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-perseverance-rover-hightails-it-to-martian-delta">river delta that Perseverance is headed toward</a>. We’ve just completed the biggest obstacle to doing that, flight 25, which was getting across this region called Séítah, which has a lot of sand and varied terrain. And when we get to the river delta, there are a few different options on the table: to help the rover drivers, to scout out targets, or even potentially to do some scouting on behalf of the next Mars mission. Perseverance is the first part of a sample return campaign. It’s sampling right now. And those samples will be left on the surface and will be eventually picked up — that’s the plan anyway — and sent back to Earth.</p>



<p><strong>SN: What does Ingenuity mean for future exploration?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> This is a new era. Aviation in space is now a thing. We can’t think about Mars exploration without aerial assets as part of that. I think that’s the most exciting thing.</p>

The EQUATOR Network aims to improve the quality and transparency of health research, primarily by promoting awareness of reporting guidelines and providing education and training in good reporting practices.</p>
<p>Reporting guidelines such as <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</a>, <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE</a>, and <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/">PRISMA</a> exist for all of the main study designs in health research, and there are hundreds of extensions and adaptations that cover different types of study and areas of medicine. The <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/library/">EQUATOR Library</a> provides a one-stop shop for reporting-related resources, including a <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/">searchable database of reporting guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, the UK EQUATOR Centre developed and launched the <a href="https://www.goodreports.org/">GoodReports website</a> to help authors find and use reporting guidelines when writing up research for publication. These guidelines ensure a clear and complete account of an author’s study, including the information needed for readers to understand exactly what was done, how, why, and the implications of the findings.</p>
<p>The development of the GoodReports website was inspired by the series <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series/research">Research: increasing value, reducing waste</a> published in <em>The Lancet </em>in 2014. The final paper of the series, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62228-X/fulltext">Reducing waste from incomplete or unusable reports of biomedical research</a>, concluded that funding should be invested into the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support better reporting, more research on reporting, and wider implementation of its findings. The initial development and piloting work on GoodReports won the prestigious <a href="https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/news/equator-network-awarded-for-reducing-waste-in-research">Cochrane-REWARD prize</a> for its potential to reduce research waste.</p>
<p>The GoodReports website includes a reporting guideline finder – the “EQUATOR wizard” – which helps researchers identify the most appropriate reporting guideline for their paper. It delivers an online and downloadable checklist containing links to further explanation of individual points and provides examples of good reporting. These tools directly help authors in writing their paper as accurately and completely as possible. Authors are also encouraged to submit the checklist alongside their manuscript to their chosen journal, demonstrating explicitly that an appropriate reporting guideline has been followed.</p>
<p>In October 2021 we published an <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01402-x">article in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a> describing the user experience and behaviour of authors using the GoodReports website both inside and outside the journal manuscript submission process.</p>
<p>Data from this study suggested that reporting guidance would be more useful if delivered to authors earlier in the writing process.  Data also suggested that guidance is less actionable when delivered in the most common “checklist” format. With this in mind we developed GoodReports further by using the checklist database to generate editable article templates, designed to make following and implementing guidance easier for the author.</p>
<p>As we move forward with additional research on the topic, we have started a study funded by the UK Medical Research Council, which is now recruiting authors to <a href="https://www.goodreports.org/grreat/">GRReaT</a>, a randomized controlled trial to test whether authors given a GoodReports article template write more complete research articles. We are comparing a group given an article template containing items from the appropriate reporting guideline for their study with a control group simply given a reporting guideline recommendation and general reporting guidance.</p>
<p>We are looking for participants who are writing up the following types of health-related study</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohort study</li>
<li>Case-control study</li>
<li>Cross-sectional study</li>
<li>Observational study in nutrition or dietetics</li>
<li>Systematic review (of a healthcare intervention)</li>
<li>Randomized trial of a pharmaceutical, medical device, procedure, or social or psychological intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>As a thank you for participating in the trial, all trial participants receive a &#8220;completeness&#8221; report on their draft manuscript from reporting experts at the UK EQUATOR Centre. The report focuses on the methods and results sections of the manuscript and indicates to authors whether individual essential reporting items from the relevant reporting guideline have been reported adequately or need further clarification or additional information.  The report also includes general writing tips to improve clarity and readability. This report can be used to improve their manuscript before they submit it, which could mean a smoother journey through peer review and the wider editorial process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-imaging-prototype-tumors-glow-cerenkov-light">A new nuclear imaging prototype detects tumors’ faint glow</a></h4>

              
                <p>A type of light commonly observed in astrophysics experiments and nuclear reactors can help detect cancer. In a clinical trial, a prototype of an imaging machine that relies on this usually bluish light, called Cerenkov radiation, successfully <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00876-4#citeas">captured the presence and location</a> of cancer patients’ tumors, researchers report April 11 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>When compared with standard scans of the tumors, the Cerenkov light images were classified as “acceptable” or higher for 90 percent of patients, says Magdalena Skubal, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.</p>



<p><a>Cerenkov radiation is generated by high-speed particles </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particle-detector-matter-subatomic-images-physics">traveling faster than light</a> through a material, such as bodily tissue (<em>SN: 8/5/21</em>). In Cerenkov luminescence imaging, or CLI, particles released by radiotracers cause the target tissue to vibrate and relax in a way that emits light, which is then captured by a camera.</p>





<p>Between May 2018 and March 2020, in the largest clinical trial of its kind to date, 96 participants underwent both CLI and standard imaging, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography, or PET/CT. Participants with a variety of diagnoses, including lymphoma, thyroid cancer and metastatic prostate cancer, received one of five radiotracers and were then imaged by the prototype — a camera in a light-proof enclosure.</p>

<p>Skubal and colleagues found that CLI detected all radiotracers, suggesting that the technology is more versatile than PET/CT scans, which work with only some radiotracers.</p>



<p>CLI images aren’t as precise as those from PET/CT scans. But CLI could be used as an initial diagnostic test or to assess the general size of a tumor undergoing treatment, says study coauthor Edwin Pratt, also of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It would be a quick and easy way to see if there&#8217;s something off … [that warrants] further investigation,” Pratt says.<br><br>The findings strengthen the case for the technology as a promising low-cost alternative that could expand access to nuclear imaging in hospitals, says Antonello Spinelli, a preclinical imaging scientist at Experimental Imaging Centre in Milan, Italy, who was not involved in the research.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-planet-neutron-star-cosmic">Crumbling planets might trigger repeating fast radio bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragmenting planets sweeping extremely close to their stars might be the cause of mysterious cosmic blasts of radio waves.</p>



<p>Milliseconds-long fast radio bursts, or FRBs, erupt from distant cosmic locales. Some of these bursts blast only once and others repeat. A new computer calculation suggests the repetitive kind <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac558f">could be due to a planet interacting with its magnetic host star</a>, researchers report in the March 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>FRBs are relative newcomers to astronomical research. Ever since the first was discovered in 2007, researchers <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac33ab">have added hundreds</a> to the tally. Scientists have theorized dozens of ways the two different types of FRBs can occur, and nearly all theories include compact, magnetic stellar remnants known as neutron stars. Some ideas include powerful radio flares from magnetars, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">most magnetic neutron stars imaginable</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). Others suggest a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">fast-spinning neutron star</a>, or even asteroids interacting with magnetars (<em>SN: 2/23/</em>22).</p>





<p>“How fast radio bursts are produced is still up for debate,” says astronomer Yong-Feng Huang of Nanjing University in China.</p>



<p>Huang and his colleagues considered a new way to make the repeating flares: interactions between a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-evidence-planets-orbiting-pulsar">neutron star and an orbiting planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/94</em>). Such planets can get exceedingly close to these stars, so the team calculated what might happen to a planet in a highly elliptical orbit around a neutron star. When the planet swings very close to its star, the star’s gravity pulls more on the planet than when the planet is at its farthest orbital point, elongating and distorting it. This “tidal pull,” Huang says, will rip some small clumps off the planet. Each clump in the team’s calculation is just a few kilometers wide and maybe one-millionth the mass of the planet, he adds.</p>



<p>Then the fireworks start. Neutron stars spew a wind of radiation and particles, much like our own sun but more extreme. When one of these clumps passes through that stellar wind, the interaction “can produce really strong radio emissions,” Huang says. If that happens when the clump appears to pass in front of the star from Earth’s perspective, we might see it as a fast radio burst. Each burst in a repeating FRB signal could be caused by one of these clumps interacting with the neutron star’s wind during each close planet pass, he says. After that interaction, what remains of the clump drifts in orbit around the star, but away from Earth’s perspective, so we never see it again.</p>



<p>Comparing the calculated bursts to two known repeaters — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-recorded-first-time">the first ever discovered</a>, which repeats roughly every 160 days, and a more recent discovery that repeats every 16 days, the team found the fragmenting planet scenario could explain how often the bursts happened and how bright they were (<em>SN: 3/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>The star’s strong gravitational “tidal” pull on the planet during each close pass might change the planet’s orbit over time, says astrophysicist Wenbin Lu of Princeton University, who was not involved in this study but who investigates possible FRB scenarios. “Every orbit, there is some energy loss from the system,” he says. “Due to tidal interactions between the planet and the star, the orbit very quickly shrinks.” So it’s possible that the orbit could shrink so fast that FRB signals wouldn’t last long enough for a chance detection, he says.</p>



<p>But the orbit change could also give astronomers a way to check this scenario as an FRB source. Observing repeating FRBs over several years to track any changes in the time between bursts could narrow down whether this hypothesis could explain the observations, Lu says. “That may be a good clue.”</p>

<h4>Turning tides</h4>



<p><em>Gravitational interactions with nearby planets and stars can hurl giant exoplanets into orbits that bring them close to their suns, <strong>Ken Croswell</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-jupiter-orbit-sun-close-gravity-star-planet">Hot Jupiters may be kicked into place</a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 13<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Croswell</strong> wrote that a hot Jupiter gets put on a highly elliptical and inclined orbit that brings the planet close to its star. Over time, the star’s gravity makes the planet’s orbit smaller and rounder. Some readers wondered if atmospheric friction, not gravity, plays the main role in the orbit’s transformation.</p>





<p>“Friction isn’t what causes a close-in planet’s orbit to change,” <strong>Croswell</strong> says. Instead, gravity between the star and planet raises strong tides — similar to those formed from the gravitational interactions between Earth and its moon. It is those tides that rob the world of orbital energy, gradually shrinking and rounding the orbit, he says. “This process goes by various names, such as ‘tidal circularization’ and ‘tidal damping.’ ”</p>



<h4>It’s shear science</h4>



<p><em>Computer simulations suggest that weird “superionic” matter, which behaves like a mash-up of solid and liquid, could explain the oddities of Earth’s center, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">Earth’s inner core may be ‘superionic’ </a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>One simulation showed that a superionic inner core slows shear waves, seismic waves that jiggle the Earth perpendicular to their direction of travel, <strong>Conover </strong>wrote. The phenomenon may explain the unexpectedly low shear wave velocities previously measured in the inner core. Reader<strong> Jeff Fisher </strong>asked how shear waves could occur in the inner core when such waves aren’t able to pass through liquids like Earth’s outer core.</p>



<p>It’s true that shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, cannot travel through the liquid outer core, <strong>Conover </strong>says. But primary waves, or P waves, which compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, <em>can</em>. “When a P wave goes through the outer core and meets the inner core, it can create an S wave that will travel through the inner core,” <strong>Conover </strong>says. “When that S wave meets the outer core again, it will create a P wave that will travel through the outer core and onward. Scientists can measure that P wave and draw conclusions about the S wave that traveled through the inner core.”</p>

<h4>A century of climate</h4>



<p><em>The last century and a half of climate science has strengthened our understanding of the roots and impacts of human-caused climate change, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">A planetary crisis</a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Connie Hellyer </strong>lauded <strong>Witze’s </strong>coverage as “masterful in its scope and clarity.” The article “should be required reading for policy makers, voters and all confused by the shards of sometimes conflicting and out-of-context factoids coming from every direction.”</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">A high-profile transplant milestone</a>” described the first transplant of a genetically modified pig heart into a human (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 26</em>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/to-solve-mysteries-scientists-look-to-muons">To solve mysteries, scientists look to muons</a></h4>

              
                <p>I don’t usually sit at my desk thinking, “Hmm, a muon just flew through my thumbnail.” But now I know that these subatomic particles from the upper atmosphere do just that.</p>



<p>And thanks to this issue’s cover story, I also know that muons are so good at tunneling through objects that scientists are using them to make discoveries on Earth.</p>



<p>Muons aren’t a big deal in everyday life. These “awkward cousins of electrons,” as physics senior writer Emily Conover describes them, don’t play a key role in making atoms. But by tracking muons as they barge ahead, researchers can detect what’s inside otherwise impenetrable objects. The process, known as muography, is a bit like taking an X-ray or a CT scan, but with naturally occurring subatomic particles. Conover explains how tracking muons’ paths has revealed a secret chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza and the plumbing of some volcanoes. Researchers hope these new pictures of volcanoes will help them more accurately predict eruptions.</p>





<p>As journalists, we tend to pay more attention to big scientific discoveries, so I was curious as to how Conover decided that it was time <em>Science News</em> paid attention to these arcane particles. Like all our reporters, she spends a lot of time digging through research journals to learn what’s new and sniff out trends. “If you see one paper in a journal you say, ‘Huh, there’s something cool happening in muography.’ Then you see another one and think, maybe this is the right time to write about it.”</p>



<p>Physicists are increasingly interested in studying muons, but what really grabbed Conover’s attention is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3113085">how researchers are using muons as tools in other fields of science</a>, including geology and archaeology. Muons are even being tested to see if they can help customs officials detect smuggled goods. “It’s so fun and interesting to learn about,” Conover says.</p>



<p>She is no stranger to subatomic particles, having studied neutrinos for her Ph.D. in particle physics. “For a lot of physics experiments, muons are kind of a pesky nuisance,” Conover says. “If you’re looking for something that’s rare or difficult to spot, muons can get in the way.” Her research involved building a muon detector to filter out the pesky particles. And many physics experiments are built deep underground, where the ground above muffles muons.</p>



<p>Rather than shunning muons as annoying uninvited guests, scientists are beginning to appreciate their humble virtues. Conover is one of them. “I’m personally familiar with muons being a nuisance, but it didn’t make me dislike them,” she says. “It made me respect them. They’re everywhere. And you can learn something from all the different particles, whatever they may be.”</p>



<p>This issue also marks a major scientific milestone: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">the first complete scan of a human genome</a>. You may be wondering, wasn’t this announced back in 2003, when the Human Genome Project wrapped up? Yes, kinda. That epic project had to skip some key bits of DNA due to technological limitations. Better technology now means 3,604 more genes to explore, some of which play key roles in assembling the human brain and may help reveal how we evolved differently than other apes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/egyptian-fruit-bat-echolocation-day-light-sound-vision">Most bats don’t echolocate in broad daylight. Here’s an exception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite their excellent vision, one city-dwelling colony of fruit bats echolocates during broad daylight — completely contrary to what experts expected.</p>



<p>A group of Egyptian fruit bats (<em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>) in downtown Tel Aviv uses sound to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982222003906">navigate in the middle of the day</a>, researchers report in the April 11 <em>Current Biology</em>. The finding greatly extends the hours during which bats from this colony echolocate. A few years ago, some team members had noticed bats clicking while they flew under low-light conditions. The midday sound-off seems to help the bats forage and navigate, even though they can see just fine.</p>



<p>Bats that are active during the day are unusual. Out of the more than 1,400 species, roughly 10 are diurnal. What’s more, most diurnal bats don’t use echolocation during the day, relying instead on their vision to forage and avoid obstacles. They save echolocation for dim light or dark conditions.</p>





<p>So that’s why, two years ago, a group of Tel Aviv researchers were surprised when they noticed a bat smiling during the day. They were looking over photos from their latest study of Egyptian fruit bats when they noticed one with its mouth slightly parted and upturned.</p>



<p>“When an Egyptian fruit bat is smiling, he’s echolocating — he’s producing clicks with his tongue and his mouth is open,” says Ofri Eitan, a bat researcher at Tel Aviv University. “But this was during the day, and these bats see really well.”</p>



<p>When Eitan and his colleagues looked through other photos — thousands of them — many showed smiling bats in broad daylight. The team showed in 2015 that the diurnal Egyptian fruit bats <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01364-0">do use echolocation outdoors under various low light conditions</a>, at least occasionally. But the researchers hadn’t looked at whether the bats were echolocating during midday hours when light levels are highest.</p>



<p>The scientists began to wonder just how rare this behavior was. “We hypothesized that fruit bats would rarely use echolocation in broad daylight,” the team writes.</p>



<p>So, the researchers trained their video and acoustic recording equipment on their study colony, which roosts on the ceiling of a mall’s underground parking lot in central Tel Aviv. After recording roughly 500 flying bats, the researchers had to admit they were wrong. Just over 70 percent of the bats regularly used echolocation as they emerged from their colony.</p>



<p>“We were surprised to see that,” Eitan says. “OK, so the bats are echolocating. But is it functional?”</p>



<p>Next, the team looked at whether the bats used echolocation while foraging, flying near and landing on fruit trees, and approaching an artificial pool to drink. The researchers discovered all the bats echolocated — some even while they had large pieces of fruit in their mouths.</p>



<p>The bats also significantly increased their click rates before landing on a branch or approaching the pool. In other words, the bats were stepping up their game as they got closer to scary obstacles to avoid crashing into them or landing badly.</p>



<p>“We suggest that echolocation provides better distance estimation accuracy than vision and is thus advantageous when flying near obstacles such as trees or when descending to drink,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>The team’s previous research also shows that when the bats fly high above the ground where there are no obstacles, they hardly smile and click, suggesting that they can stop using their echolocation when it’s not useful.</p>



<p>Most bat experts believe these mammals became largely nocturnal to avoid visual predators such as birds of prey. But “observations such as this one tell us that echolocation must be so hard-wired in bats that it keeps being used even when their&nbsp;sensitive eyes would suffice,” says Danilo Russo, a bat researcher at the&nbsp;University of Naples Federico II in Italy who was not involved in the study. “This is especially interesting in the species covered in the study, which still&nbsp;largely relies on vision besides using echolocation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coastal-cities-sinking-subsidence-rising-seas">Coastal cities around the globe are sinking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coastal cities around the globe are sinking by up to several centimeters per year, on average, satellite observations reveal. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098477">The one-two punch of subsiding land and rising seas</a> means that these coastal regions are at greater risk for flooding than previously thought, researchers report in the April 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Matt Wei, an earth scientist at the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett, and colleagues studied 99 coastal cities on six continents. “We tried to balance population and geographic location,” he says. While subsidence has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-011-9866-9">measured in cities previously</a>, earlier research has tended to focus on just one city or region. This investigation is different, Wei says. “It’s one of the first to really use data with global coverage.”</p>







<p>Wei and his team relied on observations made mostly from 2015 to 2020 by <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1">a pair of European satellites</a>. Instruments onboard beam microwave signals toward Earth and then record the waves that bounce back. By measuring the timing and intensity of those reflected waves, the team determined the height of the ground with millimeter accuracy. And because each satellite flies over the same part of the planet every 12 days, the researchers were able to trace how the ground deformed over time.</p>



<p>The largest subsidence rates — up to five centimeters per year —are mostly in Asian cities like Tianjin, China; Karachi, Pakistan; and Manila, Philippines, the team found. What’s more, about one-third, or 34, of the analyzed cities are sinking in some places by more than a centimeter per year.</p>



<p>That’s a worrying trend, says Darío Solano-Rojas, an earth scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City who was not involved in the research. These cities are being hit with a double whammy: At the same time that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-rise-coastal-megacities-mumbai-face-catastrophe">sea levels are rising due to climate change</a>, the land is sinking (<em>SN: 8/15/18</em>). “Understanding that part of the problem is a big deal,” Solano-Rojas says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Sinking cities</h3>



<p>Satellite measurements of ground height in and around coastal cities, obtained from 2015 to 2020, reveal how fast many are sinking. In parts of some cities, such as these four, the ground is subsiding by more than 10 millimeters per year. Negative values correspond to the ground sinking and moving away from a satellite, while positive ones correspond to the ground rising. The insets show satellite imagery of where subsidence is greatest, indicating that those areas are home to residential or industrial development. The magenta triangles and circles mark Global Navigation Satellite System stations used in the analysis.</p>

<p>Wei and his colleagues think that the subsidence is largely caused by people. When the researchers looked at Google Earth imagery of the regions within cities that were rapidly sinking, the team saw mostly residential or commercial areas. That’s a tip-off that the culprit is groundwater extraction, the team concluded. Landscapes tend to settle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spanish-quake-linked-groundwater-pumping">as water is pumped out of aquifers</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/12</em>).</p>



<p>But there’s reason to be hopeful. In the past, Indonesia’s Jakarta, for example, was sinking by nearly 30 cm/yr, on average. But now subsidence there and in other places has slowed, possibly due to recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-6724.14403">governmental regulations</a> limiting groundwater extraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-newly-discovered-gas-dust-formation">A newly discovered planet renews debate about how some giant worlds form</a></h4>

              
                <p>A young, massive planet is orbiting in an unusual place in its star system, and it’s leading researchers to revive a long-debated view of how giant planets can form.</p>



<p>The protoplanet, nine times the mass of Jupiter, is too far away from its star to have formed by accreting matter piece by piece, images suggest. Instead, <a href="blank">the massive world probably formed all at once</a> in a violent implosion of gas and dust, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01634-x">researchers report April 4 in </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01634-x"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>



<p>“My first reaction was, there’s no way this can be true,” says Thayne Currie, an astrophysicist at the Subaru Telescope headquartered in Hilo, Hawaii.</p>





<p>For years, astronomers have debated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-planet-stirs-old-debate">the ways in which giant planets might form</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>).&nbsp; In the “core accretion” story, a planet starts out as small bits of matter within a disk of gas, dust and ice swirling around a young star. The clumps continue to accrete other matter, growing to become the core of the planet. Out past a certain distance from the star, that core then accumulates a thick blanket of hydrogen and helium, turning it into a bloated, gassy world.</p>



<p>But the new planet, orbiting a star called AB Aurigae, is in the outskirts of its system, where there’s less matter to gather into a core. In this position, the core can’t become massive enough to create its gaseous envelope. The planet’s remote location, Currie and colleagues argue, makes it more likely to form via “disk instability,” where the disk around the star breaks into planet-sized fragments. The fragments then rapidly collapse in on themselves, drawn together by their own gravity, and clump together, forming a giant planet.</p>





<p>Using the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea, Currie and colleagues observed AB Aurigae periodically from 2016 to 2020. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope also observed the star repeatedly over 13 years. Looking at all these images, the team saw a bright spot next to the star. The bright clump was a clear protoplanet, named AB Aur b, orbiting nearly 14 billion kilometers from its star — roughly 3 times as far as Neptune is from the sun.</p>



<p>In the images, AB Aur b looked like it was straight out of a simulation of planet formation by disk instability, Currie says. Except it was real.</p>

<p>“For the longest time, I never believed that planet formation by disk instability could actually work,” he says.</p>



<p>Because AB Aur b is still growing, embedded in the young star’s disk, it could help to explain how the handful of known massive planets orbiting far from their stars formed.</p>



<p>“We only know maybe a few dozen total of these types of planets,” says Quinn Konopacky, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the research. “Every single one that we find is basically precious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s difficult to distinguish whether a planet formed by core accretion or disk instability through observations alone, Konopacky says. The fact that AB Aur b is at such a wide separation from its star is “good evidence” that disk instability is what’s happening, she says. Still, “I think that there’s a lot more work to be done and other ways that we can try to assess if that’s what’s going on in the system.”</p>



<p>Both Konopacky and Currie say this research represents <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-snap-first-baby-pictures-planet">only the second direct observation of a protoplanet</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/18</em>). Oftentimes, researchers have trouble distinguishing an actual forming planet from a planetary disk.</p>



<p>The recently launched <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">James Webb Space Telescope</a> could help researchers understand these anomalous gas giants very distant from their stars by studying the AB Aurigae system and others like it, Currie says (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). “I think this will spur a lot of debates and follow-up studies by other researchers.”</p>

                <p>Buried within the Las Pinturas pyramid in San Bartolo, Guatemala, thousands of painted plaster mural fragments offer a window into ancient Maya civilization. Two of those fragments form the earliest known record of a Maya calendar, created between 300 and 200 B.C.</p>



<p>The fragments <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl9290">depict the date of “7 Deer”</a> from the 260-day sacred calendar common across ancient Mesoamerica and still used today by indigenous communities in Guatemala and southern Mexico, archaeologist David Stuart and colleagues report April 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The calendar system’s longevity attests to the persistence of Maya intellectual culture, says Stuart, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>From 400 B.C. to 100 A.D., Mayas razed and rebuilt the pyramid seven times, creating a series of discrete time capsules stacked on top of each other, says study coauthor Heather Hurst, project director of the San Bartolo-Xultun Regional Archaeological Project. By radiocarbon dating both the material in the layer where the calendar fragments were found and the material used to bury that layer, researchers determined a narrow time window in which the 7 Deer day record would have been produced.</p>

<p>After two decades of excavation, the site continues to be an important source of ancient Maya artifacts. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-read-early-maya-writing">earliest known Maya writing</a>, also dated to between 300 and 200 B.C., was found in the same time capsule as the 7 Deer day record (<em>SN: 1/17/06</em>).</p>



<p>The 260-day calendar system “survived not only close to 1,800 years in the Maya world before the Spanish showed up, but it persisted even more recently, since conquests . . . in some of the most oppressed areas,” Stuart says. “I find that an incredible thing.”</p>



<p>In fact, the intricacy of the depiction suggests that the calendar system had already existed for centuries by the time it was drawn, says Stephen Houston, an archaeologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. The characters are “very well practiced. This isn’t a stumbling baby step.”</p>



<p>Ten other fragments described in the study feature different styles of handwriting that indicate multiple scribes worked on the murals. This suggests that the Maya literary tradition was already robust by this time, Houston says. “There’s a density of knowledge here.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-biggest-nucleus-solar-system-bernardinelli-bernstein">This is the biggest known comet in our solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus of a comet discovered in 2014 is the largest ever spotted.</p>



<p>The “dirty snowball” at the center of comet C/2014 UN271 is about 120 kilometers across, researchers report in the April 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. That makes <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac626a">this comet</a> — also known as Bernardinelli-Bernstein, after its discoverers — about twice as wide as Rhode Island, says David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA.</p>



<p>Though the comet is big — and vastly larger than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comets-spewing-oxygen-club-gets-new-member">Halley’s comet</a>, which measures a little more than 11 kilometers across — it will never be visible to the naked eye from Earth because it’s too far away, Jewitt says (<em>SN: 12/14/15</em>). The object is now about 3 billion kilometers from Earth. At its closest approach in 2031, the comet will come no closer to the sun than 1.6 billion kilometers, about the same distance as Saturn.</p>

<p>Jewitt and colleagues sized up the comet with the help of new images from the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with images taken by another team at far-infrared wavelengths. The analysis also revealed that the comet’s nucleus reflects only about 3 percent of the light that strikes it. That makes the object “blacker than coal,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>Comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein takes about 3 million years to circle the sun in a highly elliptical orbit. At its farthest, the comet may reach about half a light-year from the sun — about one-eighth of the distance to the next nearest star.</p>



<p>The comet is likely “just the tip of the iceberg” as far as undiscovered comets of this size go, Jewitt says. And for every comet this size, he suggests, there could be tens of thousands of smaller objects circling the sun undetected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-human-evolution-habitat-migration">How ancient, recurring climate changes may have shaped human evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recurring climate changes may have orchestrated where <em>Homo</em> species lived over the last 2 million years and how humankind evolved.</p>



<p>Ups and downs in temperature, rainfall and plant growth promoted ancient hominid migrations within and out of Africa that fostered an ability to survive in unfamiliar environments, say climate physicist and oceanographer Axel Timmermann and colleagues. Based on how the timing of ancient climate variations matched up with the comings and goings of different fossil <em>Homo</em> species, the researchers generated a novel — and controversial — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04600-9">outline of human evolution</a>. Timmermann, of Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea, and his team present that scenario April 13 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s how these scientists tell the story of humankind, starting roughly 2 million years ago. By that time, <em>Homo erectus</em> had already begun to roam outside Africa, while an East African species called <em>H. ergaster</em> stuck close to its home region. <em>H. ergaster</em> probably evolved into a disputed East African species called <em>H. heidelbergensis, </em>which split into southern and northern branches between 850,000 and 600,000 years ago. These migrations coincided with warmer, survival-enhancing climate shifts that occur every 20,000 to 100,000 years due to variations in Earth’s orbit and tilt that modify how much sunlight reaches the planet.</p>





<p>Then, after traveling north to Eurasia, <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> possibly gave rise to Denisovans around 430,000 years ago, the researchers say. And in central Europe, harsh habitats created by recurring ice ages spurred the evolution of <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> into Neandertals between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago. Finally, in southern Africa between 310,000 and 200,000 years ago, increasingly harsh environmental conditions accompanied a transition from <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> to <em>H. sapiens</em>, who later moved out of Africa.</p>



<p>But some researchers contend that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/evan.21929"><em>H. heidelbergensis, </em>as defined by its advocates, </a>contains too many hard-to-categorize fossils to qualify as a species.</p>



<p>An alternative view to the newly proposed scenario suggests that, during the time that <em>H. heidelbergensis </em>allegedly lived, closely related <em>Homo</em> populations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">periodically split up, reorganized and bred with outsiders</a>, without necessarily operating as distinct biological species <em>(SN: 12/13/21</em>). In this view, mating among <em>H. sapiens</em> groups across Africa starting as early as 500,000 years ago eventually produced a physical makeup typical of people today. If so, that would undermine the validity of a neatly branching evolutionary tree of <em>Homo</em> species leading up to <em>H. sapiens</em>, as proposed by Timmermann’s group.</p>



<p>The new scenario derives from a computer simulation of the probable climate over the last 2 million years, in 1,000-year intervals, across Africa, Asia and Europe. The researchers then examined the relationship between simulated predictions of what ancient habitats were like in those regions and the dates of known hominid fossil and archaeological sites. Those sites range in age from around 2 million to 30,000 years old.</p>



<p>Previous fossil evidence indicates that <em>H. erectus </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago">spread as far as East Asia and Java</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>). Timmermann’s climate simulations suggest that <em>H. erectus</em>, as well as <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> and <em>H. sapiens</em>, adapted to increasingly diverse habitats during extended travels. Those migrations stimulated brain growth and cultural innovations that “may have made [all three species] the global wanderers that they were,” Timmermann says.</p>



<p>The new habitat simulations also indicate that <em>H. sapiens</em> was particularly good at adjusting to hot, dry regions, such as northeastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>



<p>Climate, habitat and fossil data weren’t sufficient to include additional proposed <em>Homo</em> species in the new evolutionary model, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought"><em>H. floresiensis</em> in Indonesia</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans"><em>H.</em></a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans"><em>naledi</em> in South Africa</a> (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>It has <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/pdf/S0169-5347(21)00125-7.pdf">proven difficult</a> to show more definitively that ancient environmental changes caused transitions in hominid evolution. For instance, a previous proposal that abrupt climate shifts resulted in rainy, resource-rich stretches of southern Africa’s coast, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-culture-africa-inland-coasts-crystals-tools">creating conditions where <em>H. sapiens </em>then evolved</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>), still lacks sufficient climate, fossil and other archaeological evidence.</p>



<p>Paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has developed another influential theory about how climate fluctuations influenced human evolution that’s still open to debate. A series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/environmental-changes-stone-age-humans-adaptable">climate-driven booms and busts in resource availability</a>, starting around 400,000 years ago in East Africa, resulted in <em>H. sapiens </em>evolving as a species with a keen ability to survive in unpredictably shifting environments, Potts argues (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>). But the new model indicates that ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> often migrated into novel but relatively stable environments, Timmermann says, undermining support for Potts’ hypothesis, known as variability selection.</p>



<p>The new findings need to be compared with long-term environmental records at several well-studied fossil sites in Africa and East Asia before rendering a verdict on variability selection, Potts says.</p>



<p>The new model “provides a great framework” to evaluate ideas such as variability selection, says paleoclimatologist Rachel Lupien of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. That’s especially true, Lupien says, if researchers can specify whether climate and ecosystem changes that played out over tens or hundreds of years were closely linked to ancient <em>Homo</em> migrations.</p>



<p>For now, much remains obscured on the ancient landscape of human evolution.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>The next decade promises to be an exciting one for space travel. With the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">Artemis missions</a>, NASA plans to send a crewed mission to the moon in a few years’ time, and will eventually establish a base camp at the lunar South Pole for longer expeditions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/17/1087167893/elon-musk-mars-2029">Elon Musk claims</a> that SpaceX will send a crew to Mars in 2029.</p>



<p>But any long-term space mission will face numerous challenges — not just technical, but also psychological. Astronauts will have to spend weeks or months in small confines with just a few fellow crew members, isolated from the rest of humanity. So it will be important to predict how this experience might affect astronauts’ mental health — and whether there are particular activities that could protect against any negative effects.</p>



<span id="more-45982"></span>



<p>This was one of the aims of the <a href="https://saga.dk/projects/lunark/expedition">LUNARK project</a>, the results of which were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576522001059?via%3Dihub">published recently</a> in <em>Acta Astronautica</em>. Two men in their 20s spent 61 days living in a specially constructed habitat in Northern Greenland, designed to mimic the conditions astronauts would experience in a base on the moon. The participants had to cope with outside temperatures as low as -30°c and a month of complete darkness, and had no contact with the outside world other than sending short daily messages back home.</p>



<p>Each day, the participants had tasks to complete such as conducting experiments or gathering ice for water, but also had downtime to relax or socialise together. And at the end of most days, they filled in questionnaires about how they were feeling. These asked about negative emotions they might have experienced, how much they desired social contact, how lonely they felt, whether they felt time was passing faster or slower than normal, and the extent to which they experienced “resignation” (this includes feelings of detachment and helplessness). &nbsp;The two “astronauts” also reported on the time spent performing various kinds of activities that day, such as chatting, sleeping, eating, writing, and watching TV shows.</p>



<p>It was the results of these surveys that Paolo Riva from the University of Milano-Bicocca and team were interested in. In their new paper, the researchers report that both participants displayed an increased desire for social contact as the mission progressed, though they didn’t show any increase in negative emotions or feelings of resignation. Past work has found that isolation and ostracism can lead to the experience of resignation, but the team suggests that this didn’t occur on the mission because the participants had willingly put themselves into this position. However, the team did find that feelings of resignation on one day were associated with feelings of resignation the next, suggesting these feelings can have a lingering effect — which could make them harder to counter when they do occur.</p>



<p>Certain activities seemed to mitigate negative emotional experiences. More time spent talking to the other participant about personal matters or taking part in leisure activities was related to reduced feelings of resignation. Leisure activities also made it feel like time was running faster. Talking about personal matters and exercising both also fostered a desire for social contact (a need which could be challenging to fulfil in extreme isolation, but which is presumably better than social withdrawal).   </p>



<p>The researchers conclude astronauts might not experience the same negative consequences as those who are in prison, say, or who have been socially excluded. That’s because they willingly sign up for space missions, and have a clear end date for their expeditions. But there is still clearly the potential for negative psychological effects, and their study suggests some ways to counteract these. In particular, physical exercise, leisure activities, and chatting with each other about matters unrelated to the mission all seem to promote wellbeing.</p>



<p>It’s interesting that the two participants had quite different emotional experiences: one generally reported more negative feelings than the other, for example, and felt that time was going slower than normal while the other felt it was going faster. This gets to a key limitation of the study: this is ultimately an experiment with a sample size of just two people, which really limits the generalisability of the findings. It’s also worth pointing out that the participants had known each other for a long time (in fact, they were co-founders of the company that made the habitat), so their experience might not be reflected in pairs or groups of people with different social dynamics.</p>



<p>Still, it’s a fascinating set-up for a psychology study — and until we get the chance to study astronauts on the moon, this is the perhaps next best thing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/partnering-with-cruk/">Partnering with CRUK to improve quality and reproducibility in cancer research through preregistration</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, two Cancer Research UK (CRUK) award programs include a little something extra in their spring grant cycles. The funder has <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/positive-research-culture/registered-reports">partnered</a> with a consortium of 13 journals publishing preregistered research, including <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, to help grantees submit and receive a publication decision earlier in the process.</p>



<h2>What&rsquo;s preregistration?</h2>



<p>Preregistration is the practice of depositing a study design with a repository (and, optionally, submitting it for peer review at a journal) <em>before </em>experimentation and data collection begin. Journal peer review focuses on the importance of the research question and the rigor of the methodology and analytical approach with the goal of producing the strongest possible work. Successful submissions receive a provisional acceptance promising to publish the resulting research article when the investigation is completed whatever the results, provided the authors adhere to their study design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of preregistration for the scientific system in general are potentially enormous, and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>improvements in study design, since review takes place early in the research lifecycle, when the plan can be modified</li><li>more rigorous research</li><li>reduced bias in reporting and editorial decision-making</li><li>increased efficiency, and&nbsp;</li><li>a more complete scientific record that includes negative and null results as a matter of course</li></ul>



<p>For individual authors, preregistration provides a faster, more streamlined review process, with a virtual guarantee of future publication&mdash;as well as acknowledgement of a vital part of the research process that often goes unnoticed.</p>



<h2>How does the preregistered research funding partnership work?</h2>



<p>Now, when cancer researchers receive a project award from CRUK in either the early detection and diagnosis or prevention and population research programs, they&rsquo;ll also be able to opt-in receive a list of participating journals where they can submit a study design that arises from their funded awards for consideration. With the consent of the reviewers, CRUK will provide the authors&rsquo; chosen journal with names and contact details of the grant reviewers, to help ensure a smooth and efficient review. Being familiar with the work, the grant reviewers are likely to have constructive feedback beyond what was provided during the funding review. For authors based at many UK institutions, the cost of publication may be covered through a PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional partnership</a>.</p>



<h2>Preregistered publication options at PLOS</h2>



<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> both publish preregistered research, but each journal takes a slightly different approach. Learn which is right for your study.</p>



<ul><li>At <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-registered-reports"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a>, editorial assessment takes place in two phases, and results in <strong>two linked publications</strong>, each with its own DOI: a Registered Report Protocol, consisting of study design, rationale, timeline, proposed methodology for data collection and analysis; and a Registered Report, describing the completed research investigation and results.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Biology+Preregistered+Articles+Guidelines+for+Authors.pdf"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> also conducts peer review in two stages, but publishes<strong> a single Preregistered Research Article</strong>, once the work has been fully completed. Authors submit a Stage 1 protocol including the hypothesis, methodology materials and methods sections. Once the study concludes, the authors add the results and discussion to their approved Stage 1 protocol to create a single, integrated Preregistered Research Article.</li></ul>



<h2>Getting started</h2>



<p>Researchers based in the UK can submit applications for the <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/our-funding-schemes/early-detection-and-diagnosis-project-award">Early Detection and Diagnosis Project Award</a> or the <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/our-funding-schemes/prevention-and-population-research-project-awards">Prevention and Population Research Project Award</a> through June 2022. Researchers working in any field within journal scope are welcome to submit preregistered research directly to <em>PLOS Biology</em> or <em>PLOS ONE</em> at any time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-erosion-rate-us-midwest-unsustainable-usda">More than 57 billion tons of soil have eroded in the U.S. Midwest</a></h4>

              
                <p>With soils rich for cultivation, most land in the Midwestern United States has been converted from tallgrass prairie to agricultural fields. Less than 0.1 percent of the original prairie remains.</p>



<p>This shift over the last 160 years has resulted in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002396">staggering — and unsustainable — soil erosion rates</a> for the region, researchers report in the March <em>Earth’s Future</em>. The erosion is estimated to be double the rate that the U.S. Department of Agriculture says is sustainable. If it continues unabated, it could significantly limit future crop production, the scientists say.</p>



<p>In the new study, the team focused on erosional escarpments — tiny cliffs formed through erosion — lying at boundaries between <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/prairie-tales">prairie and agricultural fields</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/96</em>). “These rare prairie remnants that are scattered across the Midwest are sort of a preservation of the pre-European-American settlement land surface,” says Isaac Larsen, a geologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>





<p>At 20 sites in nine Midwestern states, with most sites located in Iowa, Larsen and colleagues used a specialized GPS system to survey the altitude of the prairie and farm fields. That GPS system “tells you where you are within about a centimeter on Earth’s surface,” Larsen says. This enables the researchers to detect even small differences between the height of the prairie and the farmland.</p>



<p>At each site, the researchers took these measurements at 10 or more spots. The team then measured erosion by comparing the elevation differences of the farmed and prairie land. The researchers found that the agricultural fields were 0.37 meters below the prairie areas, on average.</p>

<p>This corresponds to the loss of roughly 1.9 millimeters of soil per year from agricultural fields since the estimated start of traditional farming at these sites more than a century and a half ago, the researchers calculate. That rate is nearly double the maximum of one millimeter per year that the USDA considers sustainable for these locations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main ways that the USDA currently estimates the erosion rate in the region. One way estimates the rate to be about one-third of that reported by the researchers. The other estimates the rate to be just one-eighth of the researchers’ rate. Those USDA estimates do not include tillage, a conventional farming process in which machinery is used to turn the soil and prepare it for planting. By <a href="https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/frequent-tillage-and-its-impact-soil-quality">disrupting the soil structure</a>, tilling increases surface runoff and erosion due to soil moving downslope.</p>



<p>Larsen and colleagues say that they would like to see tillage incorporated into the USDA’s erosion estimates. Then, the USDA numbers might better align with the whopping 57.6 billion metric tons of soil that the researchers estimate has been lost across the entire region in the last 160 years.</p>



<p>This massive “soil loss is already causing food production to decline,” Larsen says. As soil thickness decreases, the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahdi-Al-Kaisi/publication/265410087_Soil_Erosion_Crop_Productivity_and_Cultural_Practices/links/549821df0cf2c5a7e3429cca/Soil-Erosion-Crop-Productivity-and-Cultural-Practices.pdf">amount of corn successfully grown in Iowa is reduced</a>, research shows. And disruption to the food supply could continue or worsen if the estimated rate of erosion persists.</p>



<p>Not everyone is convinced that the average amount of soil lost each year has remained steady since farming in the region started. Much of the erosion that the researchers measured could have been caused in the earlier histories of these sites, dating back to when farmers “began to break prairies and/or forests and clear things,” says agronomist Michael Kucera.</p>



<p>Perhaps current erosion rates have slowed, says Kucera, who is the steward of the National Erosion Database at the USDA’s National Soil Survey Center in Lincoln, Neb.</p>





<p>To help reduce future erosion, farmers can use no-till farming and plant cover crops, the researchers note. By planting cover crops during off-seasons, farmers reduce the amount of time the soil is bare, making it less vulnerable to wind and water erosion.</p>



<p>In the United States, no-till and similar practices to help limit erosion have been implemented at least sometimes by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/march/no-till-and-strip-till-are-widely-adopted-but-often-used-in-rotation-with-other-tillage-practices/">51 percent of corn, cotton, soybean and wheat&nbsp;farmers</a>, according to the USDA.&nbsp;But cover crops are only used in about 5 percent of cases where they could be, says Bruno Basso, a sustainable agriculture researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing who wasn’t involved with the study. “It costs $40 to $50 per acre to plant a cover crop,” he says. Though some government grant funding is available, “the costs of cover crops are not supported,” and there is a need for additional incentives, he says.</p>



<p>To implement no-till strategies, “the farmer has to be a better manager,” says Keith Berns, a farmer who co-owns and operates Green Cover Seed, which is headquartered in Bladen, Neb. His company provides cover crop seeds and custom seed mixtures. He has also been using no-till practices for decades.</p>



<p>To succeed, farmers must decide what particular cover crops are most suitable for their land, <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/killing-cover-crops-in-urban-farms-and-gardens#:~:text=Kill%20cover%20crops%20shortly%20after,crops%2C%20like%20lettuce%20and%20carrots.">when to grow them and when to kill them</a>. Following these regimens, which can be more complicated than traditional farming, can be “difficult to do on large scales,” Berns says.</p>



<p>Cover crops can <a href="https://www.sare.org/wp-content/uploads/Cover-Crop-Economics.pdf">confer benefits</a> such as helping farmers repair erosion and control weeds within the first year of planting. But it can take multiple years for the crops’ financial benefits to exceed their cost. Some farmers don’t even own the land they work, making it even less lucrative for them to invest in cover crops, Berns notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building soil health can take half a decade, Basso says. “Agriculture is really always facing this dilemma [of] short-sighted, economically driven decisions versus longer-term sustainability of the whole enterprise.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593318430">Paradise Falls</a><br><em>Keith O’Brien</em><br><em>Pantheon, $30</em></p>



<p>In December 1987, my family moved from sweltering Florida to a snow-crusted island in the Niagara River just north of Buffalo, N.Y. There on Grand Island, I heard for the first time about a place called Love Canal. Right across the river, not a mile away, lay an entire neighborhood that had been emptied out less than a decade before by one of the worst environmental disasters in American history.</p>





<p>In the 1940s and ’50s, Hooker Chemical dumped about 20,000 tons of toxic waste into the canal, eventually covering it with soil and selling the land to the city of Niagara Falls for a dollar. The city built a school on it, and houses sprang up around it. For years, residents would smell strange odors in their homes, and kids would see chemicals bubbling up on the playground, but it wasn’t until the late 1970s that local officials began to take notice. Eventually, testing revealed dangerous levels of toxic chemicals along with <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/investigations/love_canal/cancer_study_community_report.htm">increased rates of certain cancers in adults</a>, as well as seizures, learning disabilities and kidney problems in children.</p>



<p>To me as a kid, the area surrounding Love Canal was an eerie abandoned neighborhood where teenagers would drive around at night to get creeped out. The place is truly haunting. The stories I heard of toxic chemicals gurgling up in people’s backyards stayed with me, and in 2008, I returned as an environmental reporter to write about Love Canal’s legacy. Only then did I understand the magnitude of the crisis.</p>



<p>And only now, with the publication of <em>Paradise Falls</em>, do I fully comprehend the human tragedy of Love Canal and the neighborhood called LaSalle that straddled it. Journalist Keith O’Brien chronicles events primarily through the lens of the people who lived there. He focuses on the period from Christmas 1976 to May 1980, when President Jimmy Carter signed a federal emergency order that evacuated more than 700 families.</p>





<p>Having covered the story myself, I was puzzled at first to see that O’Brien covered such a tight time frame in a story that developed over decades. He skims quickly through the history of chemical dumping and touches only briefly on follow-up studies of residents in the 1980s. But he fills more than 350 pages with a narrative of the main crisis period so gripping it could almost be a thriller. As the disaster unfolds, there are horrific discoveries, medical mysteries and plenty of screaming neighbors. The whole narrative is pulled directly from O’Brien’s extensive research, including interviews and documents that had been stored for decades.</p>



<p>Chapters hop between the perspectives of key residents and the scientists and officials dealing with the crisis, but the story is told chronologically and in great detail. In fact, there’s so much detail that we even learn the type of cookies (oatmeal) served to the officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who housewife-turned-activist Lois Gibbs famously took hostage in a publicity stunt.</p>



<p>O’Brien’s previous book, <em>Fly Girls</em>, was about pioneering female aviators of the 1920s and ’30s. So perhaps it’s no surprise that he has again focused on heroines. Gibbs was the public face of Love Canal, but many of the other women who took action got far less attention. O’Brien brings their stories to light. There was Elene Thornton, a Black resident of public housing who fought for her neighbors; Bonnie Casper, a young congressional aide who rallied government action; and Beverly Paigen, a scientist who risked her job studying a problem her superiors wanted to drop.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most poignant story, told in heartbreaking detail, is that of Luella Kenny. She was a cancer researcher living with her family in a house that backed up to a creek near Love Canal when her 6-year-old son Jon Allen fell ill with mysterious symptoms. Doctors ignored her at first, but eventually the child grew so sick he was hospitalized with a kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome.</p>



<p>O’Brien narrates the family’s days with stunning clarity, capturing small but moving moments like Jon Allen gathering fallen chestnuts in the hospital parking lot and rolling them between his small, swollen fingers. By the time I read of Jon Allen’s death, even though I already knew the outcome, I cried. I felt as if I knew these people personally by the end of the book, and any misgivings I had initially about O’Brien’s approach disappeared. There are many ways to tell a story, but sometimes the simplest way — the perspective of those who lived it — is best. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">Ukrainian identity solidified for 30 years. Putin ignored the science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Before Russia invaded Ukraine, many military analysts feared that the capital of Kyiv would fall within days of an attack, undermining any further resistance. Instead, the war is well into its second month. Ukrainian fighters have reversed some Russian gains, forcing a retreat from Kyiv and an apparent narrowing of Russia’s sights to the country’s eastern provinces, closest to Russia’s border.</p>



<p>What these analysts and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself missed, social scientists say, is research showing that people who live within the borders of Ukraine have identified more and more as Ukrainian — and less as Russian — since Ukraine’s independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p>



<p>That trend intensified after Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started backing separatists in the Donbas region, political and ethnic studies scholar Volodymyr Kulyk said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRDGJiobv2g">virtual talk</a> organized by Harvard University in February. “<em>Russians</em> came to mean people in Russia,” said Kulyk, of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv.</p>





<p>These Ukrainian loyalists are now fighting tooth and nail for their country’s continued, sovereign existence.</p>



<p>“Putin underestimated Ukrainians’ attachment to their country and overestimated [their] connection to Russia,” says political scientist Lowell Barrington of Marquette University in Milwaukee. “One of his biggest mistakes was not reading social science research on Ukraine.”</p>



<h4>Historic divide</h4>



<p>The common refrain is that Ukraine is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452247">a country divided along both linguistic and regional lines</a>, political scientists Olga Onuch of the University of Manchester in England and Henry Hale wrote in 2018 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs</em>.</p>



<p>While the official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian, most people speak both Ukrainian and Russian. People living in western cities, most notably Lviv, primarily speak Ukrainian and those in eastern cities closer to the Russian border primarily speak Russian.</p>



<p>The origins of those divisions are complicated, but can be traced back, in part, to between the late 18th century and early 20th century when western Ukraine was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and eastern Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. Then, after the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Ukraine was briefly an independent state known as the Ukrainian People’s Republic before being incorporated into the Soviet Union in the early 1920s.</p>

<p>Putin seems to believe that national identities stay relatively fixed across time, says Hale, of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Social scientists refer to that idea as primordialism, the belief that individuals have a single nationalistic or ethnic identity that they pass on to subsequent generations. In other words, once a Russian, always a Russian.</p>



<p>That rigid mentality shows up in official documents and censuses conducted in the Soviet Union starting in 1932. That’s when government officials began recording every citizen’s <em>natsionalnist, </em>essentially a conflation of nationality with ethnicity. People in the Soviet Union fell into one of over 180 possible ethnic categories, such as Russian, Chechen, Tatar, Jewish or Ukrainian, political scientists Oksana Mikheieva and Oxana Shevel wrote in 2021 in a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://www.ibidem.eu/en/from-the-ukraine-to-ukraine-9783838215143.html">From ‘the Ukraine’ to Ukraine</a>.</em> &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nationality was transformed into a characteristic of a person that was inherited from his parents, rather than chosen consciously,” says Mikheieva, a political scientist at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt and the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.</p>



<p>While the Kremlin’s goal was to unite people of different nationalities under a single Soviet label, those with a Russian ethnicity remained at the top of the social ladder, write Mikheieva and Shevel, of Tufts University in Medford, Mass . Paradoxically, one’s nationality both provided a sense of belonging and deepened ethnic divides. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, may have either directly or indirectly been counting on people to still view their nationality in this way. “He’s stuck in his formative years from the Soviet period,” says Elise Giuliano, a political scientist at Columbia University.</p>



<h4>Shifting identity</h4>



<p>Today, primordialism has largely fallen out of favor among social scientists, Hale says. Most researchers now see ethnic and nationalistic identities as fluid, evolving and dependent on the political and social environment. Individuals may also consider themselves to have multiple ethnicities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of that shift in thinking comes from the study of Ukraine itself. The country’s relatively recent independence in 1991 means that social scientists can track the Ukrainian people’s evolving sense of identity in real time. And Ukraine also made the unusual move of granting citizenship to nearly everyone living within its territorial borders at the time of independence. When Ukrainian passports became available in 1992, officials likewise stopped the Soviet practice of stamping them with the owner’s <em>natsionalnist</em>. During the 2000s, that category also disappeared from birth certificates.</p>



<p>These practices contrasted with countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which refused automatic citizenship to ethnic Russians in their countries, says Barrington, the Marquette political scientist. Consequently, Ukraine paved the way for the emergence of a civic, or chosen, identity.</p>



<p>In studying post-Soviet Ukraine, researchers wanted to know: Would people living in Ukraine, even those with non-Ukrainian <em>natsionalnists,</em> shed their Soviet identity and become Ukrainian?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Official censuses conducted before and after independence hinted that the percentage of people living in Ukraine and identifying as Ukrainian did increase after 1991. In 1989, about 22 percent of people identified as Russian, but by 2001, only about 17 percent did. Migration out of Ukraine cannot fully account for that change, researchers say.<br><br>Since 2001, no national censuses have been held in Ukraine. So scientists have instead had to rely on smaller but often more detailed surveys, many generated in collaboration with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Initially, researchers continued to use Soviet terminology on those surveys. Censuses and surveys <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/census-2020-race-ethnicity-questions">shoehorn people into categories</a>, Hale says, but understanding how people’s interpretation of those categories change over time, particularly when the social context changes, is useful (<em>SN: </em><em>3/8/20</em>). Researchers thus needed to look into what people meant when they chose a certain answer.</p>



<p>That work started with the “native language” question on surveys, which even in Soviet times was hard for researchers to interpret. Asking people what they considered to be their native language was meant to capture their language of everyday use. But people often selected the language that aligned with their ethnicity.</p>





<p>For instance, about 12 percent of Ukrainians selected Russian as their native language on the 1989 census, Kulyk, the political and ethnic studies scholar at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said in his talk. But other surveys conducted around that time that did distinguish between native language and language of everyday use revealed that over 50 percent of Ukrainians spoke Russian in everyday life.</p>



<p>That confusion surrounding the native language question carried over to post-Soviet Ukraine. Surveys conducted in the 1990s and 2000s showed that many people selecting Ukrainian as their native language <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00493.x">did not necessarily speak</a> the language, Kulyk reported in 2011 in <em>Nations and Nationalism. </em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a more recent analysis of three nationwide surveys in Ukraine — conducted in 2012, 2014 and 2017, and each involving roughly 1,700 to 2,000 respondents — Kulyk investigated responses to the question: “What language do you consider your native language?” In 2012, some 60 percent of respondents said Ukrainian and 24 percent said Russian. By 2017, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232">over 68 percent of respondents selected Ukrainian</a> and just under 13 percent selected Russian, he reported in 2018 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs</em>.</p>



<p>Those numbers say little about actual language use, Hale says. Instead, the native language question is a way to gauge people’s shifting views of national identity. The growing number of Ukrainian “speakers” and the decreasing number of Russian “speakers” suggests that people are selecting the answer that’s in line with their Ukrainian civic identity, he says. &nbsp;“Knowing Russian isn’t any kind of predictor for supporting the Russian state. Instead, what is [becoming] more important is the civic identification with the Ukrainian state.”</p>



<h4>Choosing Ukraine</h4>



<p>Researchers who study identity have also begun investigating Ukrainians’ responses to the question, “What is your <em>natsionalnist</em>?” which still occasionally appears on official paperwork, Mikheieva says.</p>



<p>Ukrainians filling out those forms can interpret the term as asking about their ethnic background in the Soviet sense, their chosen identity or some combination of both. What social scientists need to understand is how Ukrainians no longer under Soviet rule perceive themselves.</p>



<p>To that end, the three nationwide surveys Kulyk evaluated in his 2018 study all asked people multiple questions about nationality. In one, for instance, participants were told: “… some people consider themselves belonging to several nationalities at the same time. Please look at this card and tell which statement reflects more than the others your opinion about yourself.” People could then select a single nationality or some combination of Russian and Ukrainian nationalities. That work revealed that the percentage of people selecting only Ukrainian went up from 67.8 percent in 2012 to 81.5 percent in 2017. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, the greatest rise occurred among people living in the historically Russian strongholds of eastern and southern Ukraine. In 2012, some 40 percent of Ukrainians from that region selected “only Ukrainian” compared with almost 65 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the percentage of eastern and southern Ukrainians identifying as “only Russian” decreased from roughly 17 percent in 2012 to less than 5 percent in 2017.</p>



<p>The actual percentage of Ukrainians allying with Russia might be slightly higher, however, as Kulyk and other researchers have been unable to collect more recent data from the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula and the disputed Donbas region.</p>



<p>More recent research also suggests that the Ukrainian people are gradually shedding their Soviet understanding of identity. For instance, in a 2018 survey of over 2,000 people, some 70 percent of respondents said that their <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2020.1851541#:~:text=The%20findings%20indicate%20that%2C%20if,central%20part%20of%20the%20process.">Ukrainian citizenship</a> constituted at least part of their identity, Barrington reported in 2021 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs. </em>That’s due, in part, to Ukrainian leaders’ concerted efforts to shift away from ethnic nationalism and toward civic nationalism, Barrington wrote<em>. </em>Deprioritizing ethnicity weakens the linguistic and regional divides; civic nationalism, meanwhile, bonds people through “feelings of solidarity, sympathy and obligation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, researchers say, these surveys all show that identification with the Ukrainian state began immediately after the country achieved independence, and accelerated following Russian aggression in the region in 2014.</p>



<p>The current war, by extension, is almost certainly cementing many Ukrainians’ loyalty to their country, everyone interviewed for this story said. “In some paradoxical twist,” says Shevel. “Putin is basically unifying the Ukrainian nation.”</p>



<p>Identity grows stronger, and internal divisions weaker, when nations are under attack, says Giuliano, the political scientist at Columbia University. During an invasion, “you are going to rally around the flag. You’re going to support the country in which you live.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/v1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The increasing use of internet, social media, wearable and mobile devices, and various e-health services, claims and billing activities, hospital and pharmacy records, product and disease registries, etc, has led to the rapid generation of various types of digital data related to population health. However, the voluminosity and complexity of real-world data urge for the development of more appropriate, sophisticated, robust, and innovative data analytic techniques to make the best use of them. In the medical field, real-world data (RWD) can be defined as data relating to health outcomes or the delivery of healthcare routinely collected in real-world settings.</p>
<p>RWD have several characteristics as compared to data collected from randomized trials in controlled settings. First, RWD are observational, as opposed to data gathered in a controlled setting. Second, many types of RWD are unstructured (e.g., texts, imaging, networks) and at times inconsistent due to entry variations across providers and health systems. Thus, RWD can be messy, incomplete, heterogeneous, and subject to different types of measurement errors and biases. In some cases, the collected data are also an unrepresentative sample of the underlying population, sometimes occurring without notice or lacking information to validate. Third, RWD may be generated in a high-frequency manner (e.g., millisecond levels in ECGs and from wearables), resulting in voluminous and dynamic data. The messiness of RWD is well-recognized; how to improve the data quality and properly use RWD to generate unbiased RWE is a work in progress.</p>
<p>The increasing volume of RWD and the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data analytics techniques, together with rising costs and recognized limitations of the traditional clinical trials, has spurred great interest in the use of RWD to enhance the efficiency of research and bridge the gap between clinical research and daily practice. During the COVID-19 pandemic, RWD were consistently used to generate RWE on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination, to model localized COVID-19 control strategies, to study behavioral and mental health changes in relation to the lockdown of public life, among others.</p>
<p>A wide range of methodologies can be used to make appropriate and effective usage of RWD derived from pragmatic trials, which are designed, in principle, to test the effectiveness of an intervention in the real-world clinical setting. Pragmatic trials measure various types of outcomes, mostly patient-centered, instead of the typical measurable symptoms or markers in the classical explanatory trials. Due to the characteristics of RWD, new guidelines and methodologies from explanatory trials have been developed to generate unbiased RWE for decision making and causal inference, especially for the per-protocol analysis, arguably more relevant for decision-making purposes.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12821" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW.png" alt="" width="370" height="242" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW.png 370w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" />
<p>Target trial emulation is the application of trial design and analysis principles from randomized trials to the analysis of observational data. Target trial emulation can be an important tool especially when comparative evaluation is not yet available or feasible in randomized trials. Controlling for selection bias and confounding is key to the validity of this approach because of the lack of randomization and potentially unrecognized baseline differences, and the control group needs to be comparable with the treated group.</p>
<p>In terms of data analytical approaches, ML techniques are getting increasingly popular and are powerful tools for predictive modelling. Moreover, new, and more powerful ML techniques are being developed rapidly. There are also many open-source codes (e.g., on Github) and software libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras) out there to facilitate the implementation of these techniques. Statistical modelling and inferential approaches are alos necessary for making sense of RWD, obtaining causal relationships, testing/validating hypotheses, and generating regulatory-grade RWE to inform policymakers and regulators in decision making. The motivation for and the design and analysis principles in pragmatic trials and target trial emulation are to obtain causal inference, with more innovative methods beyond the traditional statistical methods to adjust for potential confounders and improve the capabilities of RWD for causal inference. A well-known framework in that direction is targeted learning that has been successfully applied in causal inference for dynamic treatment rules using EHR data and efficacy of COVID-19 treatments, among others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, RWD have the potential to generate valid and unbiased RWE with savings in both cost and time and to enhance the efficiency of medical and health-related research and decision- making, compared to controlled trials. At the same time, RWD have limitations. Procedures that improve the quality of the data and overcome the limitation of RWD to make the best of them have been and will continue to be developed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-storms-deadly-africa-early-2022">Climate change intensified deadly storms in Africa in early 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change amped up the rains that pounded southeastern Africa and killed hundreds of people during two powerful storms in early 2022.</p>



<p>But a dearth of regional data made it difficult to pinpoint <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/">just how large of a role climate change played</a>, scientists said April 11 at a news conference.</p>



<p>The findings were described in a study, published online April 11, by a consortium of climate scientists and disaster experts called the World Weather Attribution network.</p>





<p>A series of tropical storms and heavy rain events battered southeast Africa in quick succession from January through March. For this study, the researchers focused on two events: Tropical Storm Ana, which led to flooding in northern Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in January and killed at least 70 people; and Cyclone Batsirai, which inundated southern Madagascar in February and caused hundreds more deaths.</p>





<p>To search for the fingerprints of climate change, the team first selected a three-day period of heavy rain for each storm. Then the researchers tried to amass observational data from the region to reconstruct historical daily rainfall records from 1981 to 2022.</p>



<p>Only four weather stations, all in Mozambique, had consistent, high-quality data spanning those decades. But, using the data on hand, the team was able to construct simulations for the region that represented climate with and without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>The aggregate of those simulations revealed that climate change did play a role in intensifying the rains, Izidine Pinto, a climatologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, said at the news event. But with insufficient historical rainfall data, the team “could not quantify the precise contribution” of climate change, Pinto said.</p>



<p>The study highlights how information on extreme weather events “is very much biased toward the Global North … [whereas] there are big gaps in the Global South,” said climate scientist Friedericke Otto of Imperial College London.</p>



<p>That’s an issue also highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC cites insufficient Southern Hemisphere data as a barrier to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">assessing the likelihood of increasing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones</a> beyond the North Atlantic Ocean (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-temperature-atmosphere-new-thermal-maps">New thermal maps of Neptune reveal surprising temperature swings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neptune’s atmospheric temperature is on an unexpected roller-coaster ride, and it could take decades for scientists to piece together what’s happening at the distant planet.</p>



<p>The ice giant’s global temperature <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac5aa4">dropped about 8 degrees Celsius</a> between 2003 and 2012 at the start of Neptune’s summer, researchers report April 11 in <em>Planetary Sciences Journal</em>. Then from 2018 to 2020, thermal images show that the planet’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptunes-balmy-south-pole">south pole</a> brightened dramatically, indicating a spike of 11 degrees C (<em>SN: 10/2/07</em>).</p>



<p>Naomi Rowe-Gurney, a planetary scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and colleagues looked at 17 years of mid-infrared data <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/move-over-hubble-sharp-pic-neptune-was-taken-earth">from ground-based telescopes</a> and the no-longer-functioning <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-spitzer-telescope-mission-ends-look-back-discoveries">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/18</em>; <em>SN: 1/28/20</em>). The researchers used infrared light to pierce Neptune’s top cloud layer and peer at its stratosphere, where the planet’s atmospheric chemistry comes into view.</p>





<p>Each Neptune year lasts 165 Earth years, so the time period analyzed — from 2003 to 2020 — is essentially equivalent to five weeks on Earth. The wildest temperature shift occurred from 2018 to 2020, when the atmospheric temperature at Neptune&#8217;s south pole rose from –121° C to –110° C.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Temperature swings</h3>



<p>These mid-infrared images from the Very Large Telescope in Cerro Paranal, Chile, and the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, show thermal snapshots of Neptune from 2006 to 2020. The map dims after 2006 (top left), showing a global cooling. But between 2018 and 2020, Neptune’s south pole lit up, indicating it warmed by 11 degrees Celsius by 2020 (bottom right).</p>

<p>“We weren&#8217;t expecting any seasonal changes to happen in this short time period, because we’re not even seeing a full season,” says Rowe-Gurney. “It’s all very strange and interesting.”</p>



<p>The researchers don’t yet know what’s causing the temperature changes. The sun’s ultraviolet rays break up methane molecules in the stratosphere, so that chemistry or even the sun’s activity cycle could be a trigger. Nailing down specifics requires more observations. “We need to keep observing over the next 20 years to see a full season and see if something else changes,” says Rowe-Gurney.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-mound-building-australia-ecosystem-malleefowl">How a mound-building bird shapes its Australian ecosystem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earthen piles built by a chicken-like bird in Australia aren’t just egg incubators — they may also be crucial for the distribution of key nutrients throughout the ecosystem.</p>



<p>In the dry woodlands of South Australia, sandy mounds rise between patches of many-stemmed “mallee” eucalyptus trees. These monuments — big enough to smother a parking space — are nests, painstakingly constructed by the malleefowl bird. By inadvertently engineering a patchwork of nutrients and churned soil, the industrious malleefowl <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.13883">may be molding surrounding plant and soil communities</a> and even blunting the spread of fire, researchers report March 27 in the <em>Journal of Ecology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such ecosystem impacts suggest malleefowl conservation could benefit many species, says Heather Neilly, an ecologist at the Australian Landscape Trust in Calperum Station. The species is currently listed as “vulnerable” and declining by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>





<p>Some animals — termed “ecosystem engineers” — produce habitats for other species by shaping the environment around them. Beavers build dams that create homes for pond-dwelling lifeforms. In deserts, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/burrowing-birds-owls-plant-life-desert-landscape">owls</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monitor-lizards-huge-burrow-systems-shelter-small-animals">giant lizards</a> support plant and animal life with their burrows (<em>SN: 10/8/19</em>;<em> SN: 1/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>“In Australia in particular, the focus has largely been on our array of digging mammals,” Neilly says.</p>





<p>But malleefowl (<em>Leipoa ocellata</em>) — found throughout western and southern Australia — also perturb the soil. They and their close relatives are “megapodes,” a group of fowl native to Australasia and the South Pacific that have the unusual habit of incubating their eggs much like alligators do: in a massive pile of rotting compost. Heat from the decaying vegetation — locked in with an insulating sand layer on top — regulates the eggs’ temperature, and the young scratch their way to the surface upon hatching.</p>



<p>Neilly and her colleagues wanted to investigate the impact that nest building has on soil chemistry and vegetation cover in the mallee ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a mallee woodland in rural South Australia, the team selected 12 mounds of varying ages. Each mound had five “microsites” — the mound itself, the ground under a nearby eucalyptus tree and under a faraway tree, and a near and far open patch of ground. At each microsite, the team analyzed nutrients in the soil and measured plant cover, abundance of individual plants and the relative cover of leaf litter and bare ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the mallee woodland is nutrient-poor, with islands of resources where the eucalyptus trees sprout. But when malleefowl collect leaf litter from vegetation patches to make their mounds in open areas, they create a unique type of habitat patch, the team found. The nests have little plant life, but their soil has carbon and pH levels like those of tree microsites. Mounds also have nitrogen and phosphorus levels in their soil that are higher than any other microsite.</p>



<p>The impacts aren’t limited to just the mounds themselves. Even nearby open sites have higher soil phosphorus than far ones, and nearby tree sites less than six years old have more bare ground due to leaf litter harvesting.<br><br>Many of these mound attributes decline with age, the team reports, with the exception of soil carbon, which remains enhanced in the oldest mounds.&nbsp;</p>

This process is repeated throughout the breeding season.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3112607">Tim Pascoe</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The malleefowls’ impact on nutrient distribution isn’t surprising “given the huge quantity of soil and litter that these birds displace when building their mounds,” says Michelle Louw, a plant ecologist at Germany’s University of Bayreuth who is based in Johannesburg and was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>But the magnitude of the malleefowls’ impact is surprising, as is the fact that the effect is traceable even in surrounding open and wooded microsites, says Orsolya Valkó, a plant ecologist at the Center for Ecological Research in Budapest also not involved with this research.</p>



<p>“This way the birds create three new microsite types in an already mosaic system, which is fascinating,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malleefowl aren’t just shuffling soil nutrients and vegetation patterns. Neilly and her team note that the tops of the mounds and surrounding bare patches have very little fuel for fires to burn, so malleefowl may also help regulate the spread of fire in mallee woodlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous research by Neilly’s team also found that <a href="https://www.birdlife.org.au/afo/index.php/afo/article/view/2222">the mounds are widely used by Australian fauna</a>. Vertebrate animals visited mounds 50 percent more frequently than nonmound sites, with five times as many vertebrate species hanging around the mounds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-two-sound-speeds-laser-helicopter">Mars has two speeds of sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>On Mars, the speed of sound depends on its pitch.</p>



<p>All sound travels slower through Mars’ air compared with Earth’s. But the higher-pitched clacks of a laser zapping rocks <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04679-0">travels slightly faster in the thin Martian atmosphere</a> than the lower-pitched hum of the Ingenuity helicopter, researchers report April 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>These sound speed measurements from NASA’s Perseverance rover are part of a broader effort to monitor minute-by-minute changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, like during wind gusts, on the Red Planet.</p>





<p>“The wind is the sound of science for us,” says astrophysicist Baptiste Chide of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>



<p>To listen to the wind, Perseverance carries two microphones. One was meant to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-audio">record audio</a> during the mission’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">complex entry, descent and landing</a>, and while it didn’t work as hoped, it is now turned on occasionally to listen to the rover’s vitals (<em>SN: 2/22/21; SN: 2/17/21</em>). The other microphone is part of the rover’s SuperCam instrument, a mast-mounted mishmash of cameras and other sensors used to understand the properties of materials on the planet’s surface.</p>



<p>But these microphones also pick up other sounds, such as those made by the rover itself as its wheels crunch the surface, and by Perseverance’s flying companion, the robotic helicopter Ingenuity. The SuperCam instrument, for example, has a laser, which Perseverance fires at interesting rocks for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">further analysis</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>). The microphone on SuperCam captures sounds from those laser shots, which helps researchers learn about the hardness of the target material, says planetary scientist Naomi Murdoch of the Institut Supérieur de l&#8217;Aéronautique et de l&#8217;Espace in Toulouse, France.</p>



<p>Murdoch, Chide and their colleagues listened to the laser’s clack-clack when zapping rocks. (“It doesn&#8217;t do, really, ‘pew pew,’” Murdoch says). When the laser hits a target, that blast creates a sound wave. Because scientists know when the laser fires and how far away a target is, they can measure the speed at which that sound wave travels through the air toward the SuperCam microphone.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Laser zaps</h4>



<p>This recording from a microphone onboard NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars captures the clacking sound of the robot’s laser zapping rocks<strong>.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/040522_lk_marssounds_laser.mp3"></audio></figure>

</div>



<p>The speed of this sound is about 250 meters per second, the team reports. That’s slower than on Earth, where sound travels through the air at about 340 m/s.</p>



<p>The slower speed isn’t surprising. What we hear as sound is actually pressure waves traveling through a medium like air, and the speed of those waves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sound-new-speed-limit-physics-fundamental-constants-earth">depends on the medium’s density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/20</em>). Our planet’s atmosphere is 160 times as dense as the Martian atmosphere, and Earth’s air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, whereas the Martian air is predominately carbon dioxide. So sound on Mars travels slower in that different air.</p>



<p>The team also used the SuperCam microphone to listen to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">the lower-pitch whirl of Ingenuity’s helicopter blades</a> (<em>SN: 12/10/21</em>). From this lower-pitched sound, the researchers learned that there is a second speed of sound at the Martian surface at frequencies below 240 hertz, or slightly deeper than middle C on a piano: 240 m/s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Helicopter hum</h4>



<p> This recording from the same microphone captures wind gusts and the distant hum of the Ingenuity helicopter’s blades, as the helicopter touches down about 80 meters from the rover.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/040522_lk_marssounds_helicopter.mp3"></audio></figure>

</div>



<p>In contrast, at Earth&#8217;s surface, sound moves through the air at only one speed, no matter the pitch. The two speeds on Mars, the researchers say, are because of its carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere. Carbon dioxide molecules behave differently with one another when sound waves with frequencies above 240 hertz move through the air compared with those below 240 hertz, affecting the waves’ speed.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve proved that we can do science with a microphone on Mars,” Chide says. “We can do <em>good</em> science.”</p>



<p>The SuperCam microphone captures thousands of sound snippets per second. Those sounds are affected by air pressures, so the researchers can use that acoustic data to track detailed changes in air pressures over short timescales, and, in doing so, learn more about the Martian climate. While other Mars rovers have had wind, temperature and pressure sensors, those could sense changes only over longer periods.</p>



<p>“Listening to sounds on another planet is another way that helps all of us place ourselves as if we were there,” says Melissa Trainer, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who was not part of this work.</p>



<p>The team is focusing on next collecting acoustic data at different times of day and different seasons on Mars.</p>



<p>“The pressure changes a lot on Mars throughout the year with the seasons,” Trainer says. “I’m really excited to see how the data might change as it gets collected through proceeding seasons.”</p>
