<p>One of the outstanding mysteries of the cerebral cortex is how individual neurons develop the proper synaptic connections to form large-scale, distributed networks. Now, an international team of scientists have gained novel insights from studying spontaneously generated patterns of activity arising from local connections in the early developing visual cortex. These early activity patterns serve as a template for the subsequent development of the long-range neural connections that are a defining feature of mature distributed networks.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0247-5">recently published <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> article</a>, scientists at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Goethe University of Frankfurt, and the University of Minnesota detail how they investigated the visual cortex of the ferret, an ideal model system to explore the early development of networks in the cortex. These are composed of thousands of neurons and are distributed over millimeters of the cortical surface. In the visual cortex, network activity encodes specific features of the visual scene like the orientation of edges and the direction of object motion.</p>
<p>By using calcium imaging techniques, the scientists were able to visualize with unprecedented resolution spontaneous neural activity patterns, i.e. activity patterns that occurred in the absence of visual stimulation. To their great surprise, the spontaneous activity patterns in mature animals were highly correlated between distant populations of neurons – and in fact were so highly correlated that the activity of small populations of neurons could reliably predict coincident network activity patterns millimeters away, and these correlation patterns beautifully predicted the patterns of network activity evoked by visual stimulation.</p>
<p>In their next step, the researchers used this remarkable correspondence of spontaneous and visually-evoked network patterns to find out how these networks developed in the immature brain. By looking at the state of spontaneous activity patterns prior to eye opening, they expected to see a striking difference in the patterns of spontaneous activity because the long-range cortical connections that are thought to be the basis for distributed network activity patterns are absent in the immature cortex. To their surprise, they discovered robust long-range patterns of correlated spontaneous activity prior to eye opening, and found that they extended over distances comparable to what was seen in the mature brain.</p>
<p>Confronted with this paradox, the researchers first considered whether the correlated activity patterns could be spreading through chains of local cortical connections, similar to a forest fire. To test this intriguing possibility, scientists built a computational model of the neural circuitry in the early visual cortex. They found that by using a set of parameters that are consistent with the organization of local cortical connections, the model could precisely reproduce the patterns of spontaneous long-range correlations they had observed experimentally, without the need for long-range connections.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that long-range order in the early developing cortex originates from neural activity driven by short-range connections. In other words, local connections build a network activity scaffold. Following the well-accepted plasticity rule ‘what fires together wires together’, activity mediated by local connections can then guide the subsequent formation of long-range network connections. In a twist of the oft-used phrase, ‘think globally, act locally’, developing cortical circuits act locally to achieve global effects. Future studies will test the prediction that activity dependent plasticity mechanisms shape the structure of long-range connections based on the instructive activity patterns derived from local cortical connections.</p>

<h4>His autobiography will make you laugh, cry, and appreciate the underdogs of the brain</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x03almlrQv4UPSfqV4OFMw.jpeg" />Ben Barres’ autobiography, rabbit for scale. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>There are very few stories like Ben Barres’. There could be more out there, but as it goes, sometimes you need to hear someone else’s story before you can recognize your own.</p><p>It wasn’t until Ben Barres read a local news release written by a trans man that he had ever heard the term “transgender.” At the time, Ben was 43 years old and a tenured neuroscience professor at Stanford. The story was a memoir of sorts, written by a San Francisco trans person and activist, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jamison+green">Jamison Green</a>. It was that four page article that inspired Ben to address a long held discomfort with his body and find a therapist to explore the idea that he too might be transgender.</p><p>Last year, many of us mourned <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/12/neuroscientist-ben-barres-dies-at-63.html">Ben’s passing</a>. Fortunately for the next generation of LGBT folk, he captured his experiences as a trans person in his posthumous memoir, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/autobiography-transgender-scientist"><em>The Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist</em></a>. I suspect that many scientists — LGBT and otherwise — will find his candid depiction of both his own life and scientific journey to be wholly inspiring.</p><p>The candor begins in the memoir’s foreword by Nancy Hopkins, who presents several emails written by Ben to various esteemed members of the scientific community, including NIH Director Francis Collins. Ben was, to put it lightly, livid about the state of gender equality in many scientific institutions. He fought tirelessly for policies to protect women from sexual harassment and refused invitations to institutions with extremely poor gender ratios. “You have a hell of a lot of nerve inviting me after sending that speaker list,” Ben wrote to one (undisclosed) institution.</p><p>In his recollection of his life and scientific trajectory, Ben doesn’t hold anything back. It is a story of many remarkable scientific achievements punctuated by intensely difficult moments, when Ben considered ending his academic career or even worse, his life.</p><p>Thankfully for the cellular underdogs of the brain, glial cells, Ben had incredible mentors and a supportive community. He came out to his friends and family in an email:</p><blockquote>“I’m still going to wear jeans and tee shirts and pretty much be the same person I always have been — it’s just that I’m going to be a lot happier.”</blockquote><p>Chuck Stevens, a scientist at the Salk Institute and a mentor to Ben replied,</p><blockquote>“I have always been fond of the person in there and the gender makes no difference to me — I expect you will find the same with all of your friends. Let me know when to change to ‘Ben.’”</blockquote><p>A few days ago, I ran into Chuck at a UCSD coffee cart and pulled Ben’s autobiography out of my bag to show him the passage. He smiled, “Ben was a wonderful human.” He recounted their exchange to me around his coming out, and shared some other similarly supportive and jovial remarks from other colleagues. One organizer of a Gordon conference apparently joked with Ben that he had thrown off the intended gender ratio — a prescient comment, indeed.</p><p>Much of the memoir is devoted to Ben’s scientific endeavors, and rightfully so. Ben thoughtfully guides the reader through the series of experiments conducted by his trainees. He writes with the precision of a practiced biologist, someone who has spent most of his life thinking about minuscule interactions between tiny molecules and brain cells. There is little conjecture but many thoughtful questions — some answered, some left for future scientists to tackle.</p><p>But when Ben writes about advocacy for gender equality and for more clinically-oriented research training, the passion is palpable. These passages read very differently from the descriptions of his science — they are urgent calls to action that stem from a life lived in the shadow of inequality. Ben has eloquently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/442133a">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5La-ZPjJdM">spoken</a> about gender inequality, but his passages in this book (as well as the example emails in the foreword) are bare, first-hand evidence of Ben’s fury. He lived a very difficult life — he does not want others to have to endure what he endured.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uF_Q5JB69oq9H1XHRKSdVQ.png" />[Image description: Sketch of Ben Barres with the transgender pride flag &amp; astrocytes, by the author]</figure><p>As I suspect many others will feel, I recognized parts of my own story in Ben’s writing. On a plane ride back to San Diego, one passage caught my teary eyes:</p><blockquote>“Many LGBT people in my generation share growing up with a shameful secret and consequent low self-esteem. Perhaps this may drive us to work hard to succeed in order to prove our self-worth.”</blockquote><p>Wow, does this hit home. I grew up in a staunchly Catholic family, and I remember explicitly telling myself that I <em>must </em>do well in school and extracurriculars to make up for my major flaw — being gay. I had to demonstrate my worth through good grades, and hoped that in the end this would outweigh my sinfulness.</p><p>Throughout his memoir, Ben candidly recounts many feelings that will undoubtedly resonate with many in the LGBT community and beyond. His honesty and openness will not go unnoticed.</p><p><em>The Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist</em> can be purchased on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Transgender-Scientist-MIT-Press/dp/0262039117/">Amazon</a> or through <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/autobiography-transgender-scientist">MIT Books</a>.</p><p>If you’d like to learn about LGBT scientists, check out <a href="https://www.500queerscientists.com/">500 Queer Scientists</a>.</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/grimalkina">Catherine Hicks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mspowahs">Ada Powers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ekaleedmiston">Kale Edmiston</a> for their input on this piece.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=57accdd6a476" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/ben-barres-tells-his-story-in-his-own-words-57accdd6a476">Ben Barres tells his story in his own words</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>BS 150 is my 4th interview with Dr. Seth Grant, the molecular biologist who has discovered surprising things about the evolution of the synapse, including the fact that vertebrates have much more complex synapses than invertebrates. In this interview we talk about his <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117470/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest paper in Neuron</a> in which his team has developed a method for mapping the synapses across the entire mouse brain. This is called a synaptome and reveals that there is surprising diversity depending on which part of the brain is examined. We discuss the implications of this discovery and how it suggests a new theory of how memory works.</p> <p>Even though this is a follow up to last year's interview (<a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/137-seth-grant" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BS 137</a>), Dr. Grant provides all the background that a new listener will need to appreciate his work.</p> <p>For complete show notes and episode transcripts please visit <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a>.</p> <p>Please visit our sponsors <a href="http://babbel.com/ginger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Babbel</a> and <a href="http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/ginger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Great Courses Plus</a>.</p> <p>Please send feedback to <a href="mailto:brainsciencepodcast@gmail.com">brainsciencepodcast@gmail.com</a> or leave voicemail via <a href="http://speakpipe.com/docartemis" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="SpeakPipe">http://speakpipe.com/docartemis</a>.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/AdobeStock_6311416-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Alcohol is ubiquitous in many western countries, and most people who consume alcohol don’t have a “drinking problem” as we usually think of it – they drink socially and it has very little to no negative impact on their daily life. They have something to celebrate? Champagne. Work’s finished for the day? Beers at the pub, or wine at the bar down the street. A hard day of yard work in summer? A cold beer hits the spot. Out to dinner with friends? A social glass (or two) of wine.</p>
<p>But just because you don’t have a drinking problem, it doesn’t mean your drinking can’t cause you problems. Increasingly, research shows that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002585">even drinking alcohol at very low levels can have adverse effects on your health</a>, with very recent research suggesting that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361830134X?via%3Dihub">no alcohol at all might be the safest policy</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>When people are choosing to drink … they’re doing so in ways that are influenced by, and reinforce, their identities</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of this, even people who don’t have a “drinking problem” are still at risk of experiencing health problems related to their drinking. We’re interested in what alcohol means for these people and how we can make it easier for them to drink less, so we conducted a systematic review of the literature.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there turned out to be limited research on people without drinking problems. What we did find, though, told us some very interesting things. When people are choosing to drink, they do so to relax (which most of us would probably already suspect), but also that when they choose what and how to drink, they’re doing so in ways that are influenced by, and reinforce, their identities (such as workers and parents) and their expressions of gender.</p>
<p>What our research didn’t tell us was also very interesting. Health wasn’t very important to this group when they were talking about how they drank, or made decisions around their drinking. It was far more important to them that they were drinking the “right” way – that their alcohol consumption fit into the socially acceptable narrative of their gender and identity.</p>
<h3><strong>How could we reduce drinking in this group?</strong></h3>
<p>Currently, there is very little in the way of campaigns designed to intervene in the drinking of middle aged social drinkers. Most alcohol campaigns target heavy drinkers, and young binge drinkers who are likely to put themselves and others at immediate danger with their drinking.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we did this research: if we <em>were</em> to target these drinkers, what sort of things speak to their experiences? We now know that unacceptable drinking behaviors are one of the things that might influence this group.</p>
<p>We usually think of young binge drinkers when we think of unacceptable behaviors, such as public drunkenness, throwing up in the streets, getting into fights, and walking out in front of traffic. These aren’t the behaviors our group were concerned with, though, so the types of campaigns that target young people are unlikely to influence middle aged social drinkers because their behaviors are very different.</p>
<p>Something that might work in this group are reminders that if you drink, you can’t always fulfill your obligations as a parent. It’s harder to get up early and drive the kids to soccer on Sunday morning if you’re a bit seedy from the night before. Or maybe, just drinking at every social occasion sets the example for your kids that it’s normal to drink all the time.</p>
<p>There are some things that might work that are problematic though. For example, telling women to drink less because it’s a bad look, while a possibly effective way to tap into the gendered constructs around drinking, is a problem because it reinforces the idea of social inequality between the sexes.</p>
<p>Ultimately we need to do a lot more research on this group and how alcohol consumption fits into their lives. If we don’t know about them, we can’t be effective in reaching them with important messages to improve their health.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/dNE5r9exF-M/">ADNI: Understanding Alzheimer’s disease through collaboration and data sharing</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/10/ADNI_tauPET_Hansson_FAN_2017_cropped-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Of the many outstanding mysteries of neuroscience, the pathogenic origins of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain one of the most perplexing neurological puzzles. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are presently afflicted with the disease, which gradually ravages the aging brain, resulting in progressive loss of memory followed by other cognitive abilities. Due to this accelerating pressing public health concern, funding agencies have grasped the urgency of supporting research aimed at detecting and treating this debilitating neurodegenerative disease, and continue to increase their funding allocations for AD research. Yet, despite decades of investigation, our knowledge of the basic biological underpinnings of AD remains remarkably inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>No lab should be an island</strong></p>
<p>Two significant obstacles to unraveling the mystery of AD are the complexity of this heterogeneous disease, and the challenge of unifying disparate findings from independent research groups using vastly different techniques and samples. For instance, how does the research community integrate reports on structural brain changes in AD from two labs each using different brain imaging techniques, and studying small groups of demographically and clinically distinct samples of patients? This problem­, of researchers working in isolated microcosms to solve enormously complex puzzles, is not unique to AD research. An evolution in how scientists conduct research–from working in protected research bubbles to collaboration and openly sharing data across lab boundaries–is rapidly gaining traction across disciplines. The solution to cracking the AD puzzle just might be found by a continued shift in this direction.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and data-sharing in AD research</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</a> (ADNI) has been a shining example of how collaborative work among experts in a given field can generate progress leaps and bounds faster than individual groups plugging away independently. ADNI was established in 2004 with the intent to collect a large set of brain imaging (MRI and PET), cognitive, genetic, blood and cerebrospinal fluid data on individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (considered a precursor to AD), and healthy controls. Across the US and Canada, over 2,000 individuals at 63 locations have participated to date, with many returning for annual assessments. By adhering to a standardized protocol across research sites, study data can easily be integrated for large-scale analysis. Perhaps what has made the project so fruitful, besides producing a goldmine of multimodal data from well-characterized AD participants, is the open <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">availability of ADNI data</a> to any qualified researcher who requests access. With the brightest minds in the field granted free access to this rich dataset, the opportunities for critical and novel interrogation are boundless.</p>
<p><strong>The fruits of ADNI</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526018335143" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently published review</a> by Dallas Veitch and collaborators on the growing findings from ADNI highlights its prolific yield. Since its inception 14 years ago, <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/news-publications/publications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1739 papers</a> utilizing the ADNI dataset have been published to date. Because of the range of measures collected, this vast literature covers novel findings in how brain structure, neuropathology, cognition, and genetics contribute to AD development and progression. Here are just a few highlights of the emerging advances from ADNI that Veitch and colleagues discuss in their comprehensive review.</p>
<p><u>Disease time-course</u>. Data-driven disease models of the temporal order of pathological brain changes and their casual relationships suggest that multiple mechanisms are likely at play in AD. Although preliminary, these models suggest that vascular changes and the appearance of amyloid-ß (a pathological protein that accumulates in the AD brain) occur early. These changes are soon followed by altered brain metabolism, disrupted structural and functional connectivity, atrophy and cognitive decline.</p>
<p><u>Genetic risk</u>. Studies have confirmed that the APOE ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD, but many other genes have also been implicated. Candidate genes include those involved in oxidative stress, amyloid and tau formation, vascular health, and calcium signaling. APOE ε4 may elevate risk through cerebrovascular mechanisms, via both amyloid-dependent and -independent pathways.</p>
<p><u>AD subtypes</u>. What we commonly consider AD may in fact represent multiple subtypes of AD-like dementia. Distinct subgroups have been identified that vary in their patterns of neuropathology and brain atrophy, cognitive deficits, and vascular and metabolic changes. An emerging theme is that AD is a heterogeneous disease with many causal pathways and manifestations.</p>
<p><u>Amyloid-tau relationship</u>. Levels of neurofibrillary tau tangles–the other pathological protein implicated in AD–are greater in individuals with high levels of amyloid-ß, but only tau (and not amyloid-ß) correlates with cognitive function. Accumulating evidence suggests a synergistic relationship between amyloid-ß and tau, whereby tau spread accelerates once amyloid burden reaches a critical threshold, collectively triggering a cascade of metabolic and degenerative changes that ultimately impair cognitive function.</p>
<p><u>Vascular dysfunction</u>. Vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol or diabetes, may contribute to brain atrophy and cognitive decline through both amyloid-dependent and amyloid-independent pathways. Vascular dysfunction is thought to be one of the earliest precipitating factors to AD onset, suggesting that addressing vascular risk may be critical to preventing or slowing AD progression.</p>
<p><u>Sex differences</u>. Women are twice as likely to develop AD than men, which may be due in part to their increased longevity. But even after accounting for their longer lifespan, women appear to have greater vulnerability to amyloid-ß and tau, and demonstrate differences in genetic risk factors for AD.</p>
<p>Although the mystery of AD has yet to be solved, our understanding of the disease is rapidly progressing, thanks in large part to the integration of data and resources across the AD research community. Open, collaborative science is becoming increasingly valued for its ability to unify research efforts, and will no doubt be crucial to future progress in many areas of research.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Leopard-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Leopards can’t change their spots, but they have changed the spots where they live…</strong></h3>
<p>Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) are large, iconic predators that are currently distributed over large parts of Africa and Asia. The Asian populations are believed to be descended from African leopards, founded in an out-of-Africa dispersal event (much like human history).</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.05.009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fossil remains</a>, we know that leopards were also present in Europe for most of the Pleistocene, but these European leopards went extinct some time during the last glacial period (~25,000 years ago). However, it has always been unclear how the extinct European leopards were related to leopards in Africa and Asia today.</p>
<blockquote><p>European leopards share a more recent ancestor with Asian leopards than with African leopards, which suggests that the European population was founded in the same out-of-Africa migration that founded the Asian leopards.</p></blockquote>
<p>We investigated ancient DNA samples derived from European “ice-age” leopards (some of which were up to 45,000 years old), as well as samples of Asian and African leopards from museum collections, to resolve questions regarding the relation between ancient and modern leopards and the biogeography of these iconic predators.</p>
<p>Biogeography involves the study of geographic distribution of lineages, and tries to infer the past processes that could have led to the observed patterns. For example, leopards lived in Europe until the end of the last glacial period, and the DNA from these extinct populations can tell us something about their origin, and how they are related to the leopards that live today.</p>
<p>The investigation of DNA from current populations may only reveal the genetic diversity that has survived in today’s leopards. Although challenging to work with, including DNA from ancient and historical samples can provide unique insights into the history and genetic diversity of a species. This is because it allows us to obtain information about lineages and populations that no longer exist today, like the European leopard.</p>
<p>Our analysis of ancient DNA sequences shows that European leopards share a more recent ancestor with Asian leopards than with African leopards, which suggests that the European population was founded in the same out-of-Africa migration that founded the Asian leopards.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Out-of-Africa: not the first and not the last</strong></h3>
<p>Our data provides further support for the hypothesized African origin of all living leopards. There are a number of other mammals for which an African origin has been proposed (e.g. hyenas, lions), including our very own ancestors.</p>
<p>We have used fossil-calibrated genetic methods to estimate the timing of the leopard out-of-Africa dispersal, and our results suggest it occurred between 710-483 thousand years ago. The genetic data for leopards also suggests that the out-of-Africa dispersal happened in a single event, rather than multiple, repeated events.</p>
<p>The timing of this event does not directly correlate with the dispersal of the earliest Hominids (<em>Homo erectus</em>, approx. 2 million years ago) or earliest anatomically modern humans (<em>H. sapiens, </em>approx. 100 thousand years ago), so it is likely that different processes drove the out-of-Africa dispersal events for each species.</p>
<h3><strong>Unexpected results from our Javan leopard</strong></h3>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10615" style="width: 274px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10615 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Lab2_PhotoCredit_KarlaFritze-264x300.jpg" width="264" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Photograph taken by Karla Fritze, University of Potsdam, Germany</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>One of our leopard samples was reported to originate from Java, where leopards are assigned to a separate subspecies (the Javan leopard <em>Panthera pardus melas</em>). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previous studies</a> found that DNA from Javan leopards was distinct from all mainland Asian leopards, suggesting that this population has been isolated in South East Asia for a long time. However, we found that the Javan leopard museum specimen is closely related to the Indochinese leopard, suggesting instead that there may have been a more recent genetic exchange between mainland and Javan leopards.</p>
<p>Although, of course, the results from a single sample should be treated with caution, they do urge for more detailed investigations of the Javan leopard and its relationship to the mainland populations.</p>
<h3><strong>Implications for modern leopards</strong></h3>
<p>We investigated mitochondrial DNA, which is only a small part of the genome and is only inherited through the female line. Thus, it only reveals a part of the evolutionary history of a species, and there can be multiple scenarios that  lead to similar genetic patterns, making them difficult to distinguish. The unexpected result for the Javan leopard is a good example of the challenges associated with the formulation of conservation strategies.</p>
<p>Currently, the conservation efforts for the Javan leopard are based on its taxonomic status as a distinct subspecies. Our results could potentially point to more recent gene flow between the mainland and Java than was previously believed, which could have implications for leopard population management.</p>
<p>However, the current taxonomy is based on many more factors than mitochondrial DNA alone. More data needs to be collected in order to fully characterize the relationship between the Javan and the mainland leopard and how to best ensure their continued survival.</p>

On Friday we reported on the case of a group of researchers in China who have retracted at least 11 papers for various kinds of misconduct. Here’s a bit more on that story, courtesy of our commenters. First, it turns out that the retraction total is at least 12. But more significant is that the … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/22/graduate-student-in-china-stripped-of-phd-after-investigation-that-led-to-a-dozen-retractions/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Graduate student in China stripped of PhD after investigation that led to a dozen retractions</span></a>

I obtained a near-verbatim transcript of a video-conference Plan S architects Robert-Jan Smits and Science Europe president Marc Schiltz had on October 19th with Lynn Kamerin and other authors of the Appeal. It appears that Smits and Schiltz see the scientists and their scholarly societies as the reactionary elements blocking the road to the universal Open Access (OA).

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The fitness landscape of MAX-3-SAT is investigated for random instances above the satisfiability phase transition. This paper includes a scaling analysis of the time to reach a local optimum, the number of local optima, the expected probability of reaching a local optimum as a function of its fitness, the expected fitness found by local search and the best fitness, the probability of reaching a global optimum, the size and relative positions of the global optima, the mean distance between the local and global optima, the expected fitness as a function of the Hamming distance from an optimum and their basins of attraction. These analyses show why the problem becomes hard for local search algorithms as the system size increases. The paper also shows how a recently proposed algorithm can exploit long-range correlations in the fitness landscape to improve on the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Focus and concentration, while normally considered beneficial attributes, can stymie creativity – especially the generation of novel ideas. This has led some to wonder whether people with “<a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/53804/how-to-use-distraction-to-your-advantage">leaky attention</a>“, and especially those with ADHD – who have what Holly White, writing recently in the <em>Journal of Creative Behaviour</em>, calls “chaotic minds” – might have a creative advantage when it comes to breaking free from prior examples. White, who is based at the University of Michigan, has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jocb.382">tested this possibility</a>, and though she acknowledges her new study is small, she believes her findings provide some of the first experimental evidence that “ADHD may be advantageous for certain types of creative thinking; specifically, divergent, unconstrained creative cognition.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35036"></span></p>
<p>White recruited 26 male and female undergrads diagnosed with ADHD and 26 male and female undergrads without ADHD, and asked them to complete two tests of creativity.</p>
<p>For the first, the student volunteers spent 20 minutes drawing and describing pictures of alien fruit, following the instruction to be as creative and unusual as they could, trying not to duplicate fruit that exists on earth (see some of their efforts above).</p>
<p>Two trained judges, who did not know the ADHD status of the artists, then carefully rated all the drawings. Drawings by the undergrads with ADHD were rated as more original and containing more atypical features – evidence, White said, of their greater “conceptual expansion”, a process “whereby traditional conceptual boundaries are extended”.</p>
<p>The second task was designed to test the students’ ability to break free from the influence of prior examples and involved them imagining they worked for an ad agency and coming up with original product names.</p>
<p>For this test, White first presented her volunteers with the names of six example products in three categories – pain relievers, nuclear elements and pasta. All six examples in each category had certain letters in common. For instance, the pain medication examples always ended in “ol” or “in”, such as Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin and Bufferin. The nuclear elements always ended in -on or -ium, and the pastas always ended in -i or -a.</p>
<p>The students’ challenge was to spend 10 minutes coming up with new product names for each category, following the instruction not to use or copy any aspects of the examples. Raters – again blind to whose work they were scoring – then judged the students’ suggestions based on whether or not they had copied the endings of the examples, and whether they also managed to sound appropriate to the products they represented. The students with ADHD managed to break free more often from the spelling conventions in the examples, while also matching the control students on the ability to invent names that sounded appropriate.</p>
<p>It’s important not to minimise the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/">problems</a> faced by people with ADHD and those who care for them. Also, the study sample was not only small, it also featured exclusively students with ADHD who were high-functioning and free of other problematic diagnoses. Remember too that the full creative process is about more than coming up with new ideas – it also requires dedication and focus to turn those ideas into reality.</p>
<p>However, White said that her findings show ADHD might come with certain creative advantages, and further research might “explore the potential contribution of the chaotic ADHD mind in the workplace.” She added: “By leveraging ADHD-related strengths and providing the necessary structure and support, individuals and organisations alike may be able to unlock the imaginative and innovative potential of the ADHD mind.”</p>

Following my reporting, the cancer researcher Carlos López-Otín abandoned his ERC-funded 36-member-strong "Degradome" lab at the University of Oviedo in Spain and moved in with his collaborator in Paris, France, Guido Kroemer. Yet Lopez-Otin's data integrity issues seem as poppycock compared to what Kroemer and his life partner Laurence Zitvogel dished out to the scientific community.

<p>Listening to a story is known to be cognitively demanding, in part because the listener has to pay close attention to, and remember, plot and character detail in order to understand what’s going on. Attention and memory are both diminished in people living with dementia. Might regularly reading aloud to such patients help, then, to train their attention and memory, and function as a treatment? A new <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pne0000141">study</a> of people with various kinds of dementia, published in <i>Psychology and Neuroscience</i>, suggests that it could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35028"></span></p>
<p>A total of 43 patients with Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia or general cognitive decline, who were living in a nursing home in Perugia, Italy, took part. All these patients had mild to moderate dementia, according to scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. At the start of the study, they were each assessed by a psychologist using a standard test of attention, language, visuospatial abilities and both immediate and delayed memory. They were then divided into two groups, matched for scores on this test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The training took place at a time when the residents would normally be in the common room watching TV. The control group watched TV, as normal. The other group went into another room for the listening activity. Over 40 sessions, run five days a week, Monday through Friday, this group listened to student volunteers from the University of Perugia reading material that became gradually more demanding over time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At first, the residents listened for 20 minutes a day to <i>Favole al telefono</i> by Gianni Rodari – a book of short, individual, humorous stories with a simple narrative structure. After a few weeks, the reading shifted up a gear, to 30 minutes a day of traditional fairy tales written by Italo Calvino. This material had a slightly more complex narrative structure and characters, and recurrent motifs. A few weeks after that, the patients started to listen for 40 minutes a day (later upped to 45 minutes a day) to <i>Un Trenzo per la Luna</i> by Cinzia Giuntoli, a novel set in Tuscany during World War 1. To follow this novel, they had to retain memories from earlier instalments. At the beginning and end of each session, the residents were asked to share – if they wanted to – their thoughts on the reading material, and any relevant personal memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At the end of the study period, both groups’ attention, language, visuospatial and immediate and delayed abilities were re-tested. For the listening group, there was an upward trend in their scores on all of these measures, while the control group showed no improvements (and even some decrements). Compared with the control group, those in the listening group now had statistically significant higher scores on immediate memory, attention and delayed memory (though not visuospatial memory).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A more detailed analysis revealed that people with vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease showed improvements in immediate and delayed memory, but only people with vascular dementia got better at tests of language and attention.</p>
<p>This was a small study. And the people in the listening group didn’t just listen to stories. Unlike members of the control group, who were watching TV, they also interacted with the student reader and with each other – and social interaction is cognitively demanding. How much this might have accounted for the attention and memory benefits is unknown because this wasn’t something the researchers looked at.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Still, the intervention –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>listening to a story, plus the social interaction and the recall of autobiographical memories – did have significant effects. Given that there’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, anything that can help with memory is surely to be welcomed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The data from this study confirm the effectiveness of the daily narrative training in delaying cognitive decline and maybe in improving the overall quality of life and self-perception of individuals who suffer from mild to moderate cognitive decline,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Perhaps, they go on, this kind of training should then be implemented as a non-drug treatment for people with dementia, and explored as a possible prevention tool in healthy older people, or for the millions around the world diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which can – but does not always – progress to dementia.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/pexels-photo-576831-140x110.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Antibiotics were once regarded as magical pills, saving millions. But unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is eroding their efficacy. One of the main drivers of this resistance is the very high use of antibiotics in primary care.</p>
<p>To understand part of the problem, consider this: have you ever taken an antibiotic for an acute respiratory infection such as a sore throat, acute cough or middle ear infection? You likely said yes: more than half of patients with an acute respiratory infection receive an antibiotic prescription.</p>
<p>Yet the main benefit of taking antibiotics for these conditions is small; the decrease in the duration of sore throat is about 16 hours compared to not taking antibiotics. You could be one of the people who will have problems from taking antibiotics, like vomiting, diarrhea, thrush or rash. Other downsides include cost, remembering to take them, and the risk of antibiotic resistance, which could threaten successful treatment of any really serious future infection (such as meningitis, community acquired pneumonia).</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the high rate of antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections. One can be the imperative for clinicians wanting to support their patients with acute respiratory infections and ‘do something’, perhaps in the belief that any benefit from antibiotics (however minimal) is better than none.</p>
<p>Another reason might be that clinicians, believing their patients want antibiotics, prescribed them to maintain a good therapeutic relationship. Some patients may even ask for antibiotics (often because they over-estimate their benefits, and do not realize they have harms).</p>
<h3><strong>Shared decision making</strong></h3>
<p>Part of improving the appropriateness of antibiotic use for infections like these is improving the communication between doctors and patients about the need for antibiotics and their benefits and harms. Better still, enabling clinicians and patients to jointly participate in making the decision to use antibiotics or not, after discussing the options, benefits and harms, and patients’ values and preferences.</p>
<p>This is a process known as <em>shared decision making</em>. We know this can help with reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, the question is: how much does it currently occur within consultations between doctors and patients with acute respiratory infections?</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-018-0854-y?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Family_Practice-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_OCT2018_antibiotic_conversations">Our study</a> addressed this question, along with how antibiotic benefits and harms, including antibiotic resistance, are discussed during routine clinical consultations and what happens to the conversation when decision aids (tools designed to encourage shared decision making and include the benefits and harms of using or not using antibiotics) are used.</p>
<p>This research was part of a larger study in southeast Queensland, Australia – a randomized controlled trial of decision aids for the most common acute respiratory infections (sore throat, middle ear infection, acute cough) that antibiotics are prescribed for, to see if providing decision aids this reduces antibiotic prescribing.</p>
<h3><strong>How common is shared decision making?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>When clinicians who had been provided with a patient decision aid used it, the discussion about antibiotic benefits and harms, including talking about antibiotic resistance, was better.</p></blockquote>
<p>We audio-recorded 36 consultations with patients who had acute respiratory infection, and afterwards asked the patients about their involvement in the treatment decision and confidence in the decision. Ideally, we would have recorded all the consultations in the randomized trial – but doing so would have been prohibitively expensive and difficult.</p>
<p>We found that the extent to which shared decision making occurred in consultations was quite low. Even simple communication about antibiotic benefits and harms was not common: it was rare in consultations when decision aids were not used, and antibiotic resistance was never mentioned as a harm. However, when clinicians who had been provided with a patient decision aid used it, the discussion about antibiotic benefits and harms, including talking about antibiotic resistance, was better.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, patients thought that they were highly involved in the decision, even when they were not. Perhaps this comes from low expectations: patients who have never experienced shared decision making will have no idea what it is like.</p>
<p>Our current study suggests that using decision aids might improve the way primary care doctors communicate antibiotic benefits and harms in routine consultations for acute respiratory infection – and this is important so that patients can make an informed health decision. The next time you visit your primary care doctor with one of these infections, ask some questions such as: what will happen if you wait and watch? How much benefit is there from antibiotics? And how much harm is there?</p>

<p>In chronic pain, the pain system is locked in to a high-alert mode. One of my colleagues describes it as replacing your alarm system after a burglary, but with one so sensitive it goes off when a fly goes through the room. Mere touch may now be experienced as pain. The pain is real, it isn’t “just in the head”, but nor is there a hidden injury to fix or illness that can be cured. It’s a system that needs retuning, and that calls for participation from the body itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22689">paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychology</i> one particularly promising way that psychologists can help with this is by encouraging <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/53949/the-dangers-of-being-too-hard-on-yourself">self-compassion</a>: a practice of recognising one’s own suffering, accepting this is part of a shared human experience, and not over-identifying with the suffering.</p>
<p><span id="more-35017"></span></p>
<p>Sérgio Carvalho from the University of Coimbra and his colleagues surveyed women living with chronic pain, to better understand which psychological states seem to coincide with, and potentially support, pain acceptance – an important outcome given that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431422">past research</a> has demonstrated a causal link between greater pain acceptance and lower depression (pain acceptance is about recognising that the pain experience is part of your life and may continue to be so for the foreseeable future. It also means being willing to put up with that pain, and, crucially, to pursue valued goals and act in their pursuit, despite pain).</p>
<p>Two hundred and thirty-one Portuguese women with chronic pain (symptoms lasting more than three months) – most of them diagnosed with fibromyalgia – reported their acceptance of pain using a well established instrument that looks at both willingness to experience pain and how much valued actions are attempted in the face of pain. As expected, those women who said they completed more valued activities in the face of pain also reported fewer depressive symptoms (and also a lower pain intensity).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants also completed measures of their mindful awareness – how aware they are of present-moment daily activities – and self-compassion, measured by items such as “I try to see my failings as part of the human condition”. Both of these measures correlated negatively with depression, but only greater self-compassion was linked with engaging in more activities in the face of pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s plausible then that self-compassion lifts mood because it encourages people to accept their pain and act. Engaging in activity starts to strengthen the body, send hormones flowing that increase mood and themselves can reduce pain, and puts back sources of pleasure and satisfaction into one’s life.</p>
<p>This study suggests mindfulness (which was not linked with greater activity) may also be useful in decreasing depression, but by other means, possibly through creating distance from unhelpful thoughts that may arise around pain or the experience of disability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As cross-sectional research, we can’t draw clear causal conclusions from the new findings, but they do help us refine our understanding of which mechanisms are more likely to increase pain acceptance. The findings may also help pain management professionals focus their methods, providing people with the ground from which they can build and sustain a life defined not by pain, but by values and meaning.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/migraine-ADHD-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097237/">recent study</a> in <em>Science</em> by <em>The Brainstorm Consortium</em> assessed the genetic correlation between neurological and psychiatric traits. The results showed that there is a small but significant genetic correlation between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and migraine. However, the symptomatic correlation of these disorders has never actually been observed in an adult.</p>
<p>Most research on ADHD and migraine has focused on children and adolescents since ADHD has mainly been observed in these groups. It has been argued that symptoms of ADHD disappear with age. However, during the last few years, it has been established that adult ADHD is a real and prevalent phenotype, and that the much lower observance is caused by adults’ increased ability to adapt – both themselves and to their surroundings. With age, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617155/">adults with ADHD are likely to learn to deal with their symptoms</a>, and they are more likely to select jobs and environments where the disease will be accepted or can remain hidden. In other words, they have the power to shape their lives in a way that children and adolescents in the school system can not. ADHD has therefore been much more evident in children and for this reason, no studies with  a large cohort of adults with ADHD have been available.</p>
<blockquote><p>With these data, they were able to conclude that there was an association between the occurrence of ADHD and migraine in adults that were otherwise healthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to collect data, Dr. Hansen and colleagues conducted individual assessments of ADHD and migraine symptoms from 26,456 participants of the Danish Blood Donor Study. Prior to blood donation participants answered two questionnaires. The first was the Screening Questionnaire for Migraine to asses for the presence of migraine.  The 18 item ADHD Self-Report Scale v1.1 was filled out to assess for ADHD symptoms.  With these data, they were able to conclude that there was an association between the occurrence of ADHD and migraine in adults that were otherwise healthy. One interesting finding was that adults with higher ADHD symptomatology were more likely to experience migraine with visual disturbances (also known as aura) compared to migraine without visual disturbances.</p>
<p>By obtaining this very large and unique cohort, they discovered that there is indeed a strong correlation between ADHD and migraine even though it has not been observable in earlier studies of children cohorts. We also observed that this comorbidity was particularly pronounced in individuals between 45-55 years of age. These findings suggest that  ADHD or migraine symptoms change over the course of life. Another possibility might be that there is a difference between individuals who are diagnosed as children and individuals who are diagnosed as adults.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Hansen established an association between migraine and ADHD the findings have resulted in more questions. Future studies will aim to elucidate which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the migraine-ADHD comorbidity.</p>

<p>Psychology as a scientific field enjoys a tremendous level of popularity throughout society, a fascination that could even be described as religious. This is likely the reason why it is one of the most popular undergraduate majors in European and American universities. At the same time, it is not uncommon to encounter the firm opinion that psychology in no way qualifies for consideration as a science. Such extremely critical opinions about psychology are often borrowed from authorities – after all, it was none other than the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman who, in a famous interview in 1974, compared the social sciences and psychology in particular to a cargo cult. Scepticism toward psychological science can also arise following encounters with the commonplace <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/">simplifications and myths spread by pop-psychology</a>, or as a product of a failure to understand what science is and how it solves its dilemmas.</p>
<p>According to William O’Donohue and Brendan Willis of the University of Nevada, these issues are further compounded by undergraduate psychology textbooks. Writing recently in <em>Archives of Scientific Psychology</em>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-40988-001">they argue</a> that “[a] lack of clarity and accuracy in [psych textbooks] in describing what science is and psychology’s relationship to science are at the heart of these issues.” The authors based their conclusions on a review of 30 US and UK undergraduate psychology textbooks, most updated in the last few years (general texts and others covering abnormal, social and cognitive psych), in which they looked for 18 key contemporary issues in philosophy of science.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35009"></span></p>
<p>Almost a quarter of the sampled textbooks explicitly and boastfully stated that there is no difference between psychology and other “hard” sciences such as chemistry and physics. Yet only one textbook discussed “methodological freedom” – the idea asserted by the philosopher-critic of science, Paul Feyerabend, that all scientific techniques are different. Only one textbook mentioned the issue of improper use of ad hoc hypotheses, a characteristic of pseudoscience. Similarly, there was only one reference to the ideas put forward by Feyerabend and Alan Gross that persuasion and rhetoric are a key part of science – i.e. that the scientific endeavour is not merely about “the dispassionate evaluation of evidence”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There were also just three mentions of such important issues as “evolutionary epistemology” (how knowledge accumulates), “social constructionism” (how social context shapes our scientific understanding), and “Kuhnian paradigms” (a discussion regarding Kuhn’s idea of paradigms, including that knowledge is only interpreted within a certain paradigm and how Kuhnian paradigm shifts occur), and the question of whether psychology is a pre-paradigmatic science or mature science. Only four textbooks contained any sort of discussion regarding whether or not the definition of science itself is a controversial topic. The roles of competing theories and evaluations in science were mentioned only six times.</p>
<p>“… [U]ndergraduate psychology students are not being provided a clear sense of what science is as well as its complexities,” the researchers concluded. “[The] data also generally suggest that students are being presented a simplistic notion of science as having a relatively straightforward and settled characterisation. Few texts mention that science is difficult to define, or that there are multiple proposed accounts of science. This is concerning, especially given the continual debate regarding psychology’s (and other social sciences) relationships to the natural sciences …” O’Donohue and Willis said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the plus side, there was a far more exhaustive treatment by textbook authors of some meta-science issues (the question of how science should be practised). Most frequently – in 16 textbooks – there was discussion of the crucial role of theory in forming and testing hypotheses. Among other topics that O’Donohue and Willis looked for, those mentioned most frequently included the tentativeness of scientific facts and whether science is deductive or inductive (seven books argued for it being deductive, three against). However, only eight of the sampled books identified pseudoscience as a concern and discussed how to differentiate pseudoscience from legitimate science.</p>
<p>The new findings confirm other unfavourable assessments of the value of psychology textbooks, such as their involvement in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/22/introductory-psychology-books-accused-of-spreading-myths-and-left-leaning-bias/">spreading pop-psychological myths and liberal-leaning bias</a>; <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/08/best-selling-introductory-psychology-books-give-a-misleading-view-of-intelligence/">giving a misleading view of intelligence</a>; ignoring modern criticism of such famous studies as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">Milgram’s experiments</a>, or the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>; and being <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/10/13/evolutionary-psychologists-expose-the-shoddy-treatment-of-their-discipline-by-textbooks/">misleading about evolutionary psychology</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A simplistic notion of science presented in undergrad textbooks is not only a problem for the image of our discipline in the eyes of the public. O’Donohue and Willis rightly point out that covering issues such as “logic, definition of knowledge, bias in science, how to evaluate theories and other topics that can apply to the informed citizen’s appraisal of important issues ranging from human contributions to climate change, to the legitimacy of research involving Big Pharma, to understanding whether evolution is ‘just a theory’,” are also relevant for the general goals of a liberal education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the content of textbooks in undergraduate psychology suggest that they serve not only to instruct, but also to essentially indoctrinate students into a particular way of thinking. A pity that this new study and others have so far not answered the question of how much content has been omitted by authors because they disagree with it, and how much because they are ignorant of it. Perhaps this is a significant research problem that should be explored in the future?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Note: This post was written by Robin Champieux, Research Engagement and Open Science Librarian at OHSU.  Robin is the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/">Metrics Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/libraries">Awesome Foundation Libraries Chapter</a>.  Her work and research is focused on enabling the creation, reproducibility, accessibility, and impact of digital scientific materials.</em></p>
<p>Librarians, are you talking about preprints? A <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq">preprint</a></u> is a complete scientific article posted on a public server before peer review.  Preprints speed dissemination and encourage early feedback.  But, this post isn’t about defining preprints and their value.  It’s October, I’m a scholarly communication librarian, so I’ve been panicking–<em>I mean thinking</em>–about what do for <u><a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a></u>.  This year, I’m focusing my outreach efforts on preprints and I want to tell you why.</p>
<p>I am passionate about open science and realizing its benefits, but I am just as passionate about supporting student, faculty, and institutional success.  These goals, which are increasingly aligned, require a deep understanding of the scholarly communication and research landscape and right now preprints are a center of conversation in this space<sup><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/899">1</a></sup>.  Funders like the NIH and Helmsley Charitable Trust are encouraging researchers to share and cite preprints, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is even requiring it:</p>
<p><strong><em>“To encourage rapid dissemination of results, any publications related to this funded work must be submitted to a preprint server, such as bioRxiv, before the first submission to a journal.”</em><em><sup><a href="https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/science/rfa/collaborative-science">2</a></sup></em><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p>Journals are accepting manuscripts previously posted as preprints, inviting submissions from preprint servers, and linking to preprint versions of papers under consideration<sup><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies">3</a></sup>.  The number of published preprints is rising<sup><a href="http://www.prepubmed.org/monthly_stats/">4</a></sup> and stakeholders are responding with support and concern<sup><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/27098/">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Researchers have to navigate this context and make decisions about how to share their work:  librarians can contribute to their success and affect change by responding to this need. In my experience, most researchers encounter and experiment with innovations in scholarly communication via specific points of choice or pressure. Librarian led outreach related to preprints can lead to conversations that catalyze a deeper interest in scholarly communication issues and changes. Collectively and over time these small and personal experiments and the discussions that surround them (including critical ones) help shift the needle towards openness.</p>
<p>I also believe in a definition of and critical approach to open science (and librarianship) that acknowledges how history, inequality, and privilege influence our scholarly communication practices and priorities.  Author and NYU Scholarly Communication Librarian <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/people/april-hathcock/">April Hathcock</a> advocates for flipping the script on how we view open:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Rather than looking at it as a means of getting mainstream scholarship out to the margins, instead I want us to see it as a way of getting scholarship from marginalized communities into our mainstream discourse.”</em><em><sup><a href="https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/opening-up-the-margins/">6</a></sup></em></strong></p>
<p>Preprints sit within a larger and evolving discussion about how scholarship is communicated and endorsed. I am excited about initiatives, like <u><a href="https://prereview.org/">PREreview</a></u>, that communities are developing around preprints to address issues of inclusion and representation in peer review.  From this perspective, preprints are a tool for democratizing “access to [and participation in] science on a global scale”<sup><a href="https://blog.datproject.org/2018/10/03/prereview-joins-cs-s-sponsored-project-program/">7</a></sup>.  As librarians, we can support these projects and invent new ones that leverage preprints to take up April’s challenge.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to raise the volume on the “power of the preprint” and address the reasons why <u><a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/columnists/learned-stop-worrying-love-preprints/">some researchers are reluctant to share them</a></u>?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a deep dive on the preprints landscape.  <a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info">ASAPbio’s preprint info center</a> is a great starting place.</li>
<li>Connect with your institution’s preprint champions <em>and</em> ask them about their motivations.</li>
<li>Use your preprint and institutional knowledge to launch an engagement and demystification campaign.  Low bandwidth? Keep it simple by <u><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/10/live-streamed-preprint-journal-clubs/">promoting existing events</a></u> and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/support-preprints">reusing the work of others</a></u>.</li>
<li>Start a discussion with organizations on your campus working to address inequities and increase diversity in science about this year’s <u><a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2018-international-open-access-week-to-be-designing-equi">Open Access Week theme </a></u>and the role preprints might play.</li>
<li>Model the shift to open!  Share your own scholarship on <u><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/">LISSA</a></u>, <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/">e-LIS</a> and other preprint servers.</li>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>According to the Mindset Theory, if you tell a child repeatedly that they’re smart, it makes them less willing to push themselves when they get stuck on an intellectual challenge, presumably because failure would threaten their self-image of being a “smart kid”. For this reason, effort-based praise – rewarding kids for “working hard” rather than “being smart” – is widely recommended (though it’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/24/growth-mindset-theory-doesnt-translate-directly-from-kids-to-adults-telling-an-adult-they-are-a-hard-worker-can-backfire/">not the same for adults</a>). But does a similar effect occur in the social sphere? What if you ask a child – as so many parents and surely teachers do – to “be a helper” as if it’s a category that you either belong to or you don’t?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier research has found that young kids are more likely to try to help others when they are asked to “be helpers” instead of “to help”. But as Emily Foster-Hanson and her fellow researchers at New York University note, “Setbacks and difficulties are common features of children’s experience throughout development and into adulthood,” so it’s important to examine the effects of category labelling – like “being smart” or “being a helper” – when things go wrong for the child. And in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13147">new paper</a>, published in <i>Child Development</i>, they find that setbacks are more detrimental to a child labelled “a helper” than a child asked “to help”.</p>
<p><span id="more-34998"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited a total of 139 four- and five-year olds who were visiting the Children’s Museum of Manhattan and tested each of them alone in a private room in the museum. At the start, half of them were primed with a short introduction to think of themselves as “a helper” (for example, “when someone needs to pick things up, you could be a helper”) and the others to think of themselves as someone who could “help” (“when someone needs to pick things up, you could help”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers gave the children various theoretical helping scenarios to act out with puppets, one of which represented them, either “helping” or “being a helper”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(the wording was varied in the experimenter’s script according to the child’s experimental group). Afterwards the children were quizzed about their attitudes towards helping and the results suggested that, after role-playing encountering a setback when helping (such as accidentally knocking over a cup of crayons when tidying them up), “helpers” had more negative attitudes toward helping than those who’d “helped”.</p>
<p>For a second study, on a fresh group of children, the researchers investigated the effect of real setbacks. These kids were set up to fail. In one scenario, for example, an experimenter prompted the child to help (or be a helper) by putting away a box that was on the table. If the child didn’t immediately go to do it, they got a succession of prompts, until they did. But the box had a loose bottom, and it was full of ping pong balls, which fell onto the floor when the child picked it up. In another example, a child was prompted to put away a toy truck, which had in fact been disassembled and then had the parts put back together so that it looked intact, but as soon as it was picked up, it fell apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that after experiencing these setbacks, the “helper” kids were less likely to voluntarily go and help in two other fairly demanding helping situations (such as going into another part of the room to put away bricks into bags) than the kids in the “helping” group. “This pattern is broadly consistent with the idea that children who had been told to ‘be helpers’ but then made mistakes were overall less motivated to help than the children who had been told ‘to help’,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The helper kids were, however, <i>more</i> likely to go on to voluntarily help with an easy task that involved bending down to pick up dropped crayons that they could then use. This was a low-effort task with a high degree of success. Perhaps they were taking advantage of a quick, virtually guaranteed way to restore a little of their dented “helper” image.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also found that children asked to be helpers – and who subsequently chose not to help on either of the more effortful tasks – afterwards gave lower self-evaluations of their helping abilities than children in the “helping” group who had also declined to help with those tasks. This suggests that the helper group were now thinking in a black-and-white way about helper status and helping abilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“These data indicate that categorical language can have detrimental consequences for children’s behaviour, even in non-academic domains and even when the categorical input is not evaluative in content,” the researchers write. (In these studies, no one talked about being a “good helper” and there was no evaluation of this behaviour.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Do these scenarios accurately mirror real life? After the setbacks, the experimenter always responded in a neutral fashion, saying without emotion, “Oh well, I guess I can put those away later”, for instance. A parent or a teacher might respond differently, telling the child not to worry, and pointing out that it was a really tricky task. Might these kinds of encouraging, comforting responses ameliorate or even eradicate the effects of a setback on future helping? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Still, this work does, as the researchers write, “provide an important caveat to previous messages to parents and teachers about how to use language to encourage pro-sociality in early childhood.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>We humans tend to forget we’re wildlife, which is possibly why our planet is heading for climate change catastrophe. We’ve lost connection with Planet Earth and she’s fighting back.</p>
<p>I have come to believe one symptom of our loss of connection the is loss of mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Lifestyle change isn’t simply about preventing or treating disease but is about reconnecting with Planet Earth and to eat, drink, move, sleep and connect with others the way Mother Nature intended.</p>

<hr />
<p>When someone is diagnosed with a mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety, <a href="https://theconversation.com/youve-been-diagnosed-with-depression-now-what-44976">first line treatments</a> usually include psychological therapies and medication. What’s not always discussed are the changeable lifestyle factors that influence our mental health.</p>
<p>Even those who don’t have a mental health condition may still be looking for ways to further improve their mood, reduce stress, and manage their day-to-day mental health.</p>
<p>It can be empowering to make positive life changes. While time restrictions and financial limitations may affect some people’s ability to make such changes, we all have the ability to make small meaningful changes.</p>
<p><em><strong><br />
</strong></em>Here are five lifestyle changes to get you started:</p>
<h2>1. Improve your diet and start moving</h2>
<p>Wholefoods such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, wholegrains, lean red meat and seafood, provide nutrients that are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0237-8">important for optimal brain function</a>. These foods contain magnesium, folate, zinc and essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>Foods rich in polyphenols, such as berries, tea, dark chocolate, wine and certain herbs, also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334236">play an important role in brain function</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of exercise, many types of fitness activities are potentially beneficial – from <a href="https://blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/default-source/factsheets/exercise_depression.pdf">swimming, to jogging, to lifting weights, or playing sports</a>. Even just getting the body moving by taking a brisk walk or doing active housework is a positive step.</p>
<p>Activities which also involve social interaction and exposure to nature can potentially <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22616429">increase mental well-being even further</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21694556">General exercise guidelines</a> recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days during the week (about 150 minutes total over the week). But even short bouts of activity <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23795769">can provide an immediate elevation of mood</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Reduce your vices</h2>
<p>Managing problem-drinking or substance misuse is an obvious health recommendation. People with alcohol and drug problems have a greater likelihood than average of having a mental illness, and have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277044">far poorer health outcomes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988010">Some research has shown</a> that a little alcohol consumption (in particular wine) may have beneficial effects on preventing depression. Other recent data, however, has revealed that light alcohol consumption <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2353">does not provide any beneficial effects on brain function</a>.</p>
<p>Stopping smoking is also an important step, as nicotine-addicted people are constantly at the mercy of a withdrawal-craving cycle, which profoundly affects mood. It may take time to address the initial symptoms of stopping nicotine, but the brain chemistry will adapt in time.</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923980/">associated with better mood and reduced anxiety</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Prioritise rest and sleep</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25454674">Sleep hygiene techniques</a> aim to improve sleep quality and help treat insomnia. They including adjusting caffeine use, limiting exposure to the bed (regulating your sleep time and having a limited time to sleep), and making sure you get up at a similar time in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people are genetically wired towards being more of a morning or evening person, so we need to ideally have some flexibility in this regard (especially with work schedules).</p>
<p>It’s also important not to force sleep – if you can’t get to sleep within around 20 minutes, it may be best to get up and focus the mind on an activity (with minimal light and stimulation) until you feel tired.</p>
<p>The other mainstay of better sleep is to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Chronotherapeutics+and+psychiatry%3A+setting+the+clock+to+relieve+the+symptoms">reduce exposure to light</a> – especially blue light from laptops and smartphones – prior to sleep. This will increase the secretion of melatonin, which helps you get to sleep.</p>
<p>Getting enough time for relaxation and leisure activities is <a href="https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/29550608">important for regulating stress</a>. Hobbies can also enhance mental health, particularly if they involve physical activity.</p>
<h2>4. Get a dose of nature</h2>
<p>When the sun is shining, many of us seem to feel happier. Adequate exposure to sunshine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480364">helps levels of the mood-maintaining chemical</a> serotonin. It also boosts vitamin D levels, which also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680471">has an effect on mental health</a>, and helps at the appropriate time to regulate our sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>The benefits of sun exposure need to be balanced with the risk of skin cancer, so take into account the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-protect-your-skin-while-getting-enough-vitamin-d-34143">recommendations for sun exposure</a> based on the time of day/year and your skin colour.</p>
<p>You might also consider limiting your exposure to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242804">environmental toxins</a>, chemicals and pollutants, including “noise” pollution, and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318230.php">cutting down</a> on your mobile phone, computer and TV use if they’re excessive.</p>
<p>An antidote to this can be simply spending time in nature. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093955">Studies show</a> time in the wilderness can improve self-esteem and mood. In some parts of Asia, spending time in a forest (known as forest bathing) is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28788101">considered a mental health prescription</a>.</p>
<p>A natural extension of spending time in flora is also the positive effect that animals have on us. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27541053">Research suggests</a> having a pet has many positive effects, and animal-assisted therapy (with horses, cats, dogs, and even dolphins) may also boost feelings of well-being.</p>
<h2>5. Reach out when you need help</h2>
<p>Positive lifestyle changes aren’t a replacement for medication or psychological therapy but, rather, as something people can undertake themselves on top of their treatment.</p>
<p>While many lifestyle changes can be positive, some changes (such as avoiding junk foods, alcohol, or giving up smoking) may be challenging if being used as a psychological crutch. They might need to be handled delicately, and with professional support.</p>
<p>Strict advice promoting abstinence, or a demanding diet or exercise regime, may cause added suffering, potentially provoking guilt if you can’t meet these expectations. So go easy on yourself.</p>
<p>That said, take a moment to reflect how you feel mentally after a nutritious wholefood meal, a good night’s sleep (free of alcohol), or a walk in nature with a friend. `</p>

Retraction Watch readers may be familiar with the name Piero Anversa. Until several years ago, Anversa, a scientist at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was a powerful figure in cardiac stem cell research. “For ten years, he ran everything,” says Jeffery Molkentin, a researcher at Cincinnati Children’s whose lab was among the … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/14/harvard-and-the-brigham-recommend-31-retractions-for-cardiac-stem-cell-work/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Harvard and the Brigham recommend 31 retractions for cardiac stem cell work</span></a>
