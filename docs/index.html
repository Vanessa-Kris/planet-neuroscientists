              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">5 cool things to know about NASA’s Lucy mission to the Trojan asteroids</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, a spacecraft is headed to Jupiter’s odd Trojan asteroids. What <a href="http://lucy.swri.edu/">Lucy</a> finds there could provide a fresh peek into the history of the solar system.</p>



<p>“Lucy will profoundly change our understanding of planetary evolution in our solar system,” Adriana Ocampo, a planetary scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said at a news briefing October 14.</p>



<p>The mission is set to launch from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., as early as October 16. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-sets-coverage-invites-public-to-virtually-join-lucy-launch">Live coverage</a> will air on NASA TV beginning at 5 a.m. EDT, in anticipation of a 5:34 a.m. blast off.</p>



<p>The Trojan asteroids are two groups of space rocks that are gravitationally trapped in the same orbit as Jupiter around the sun. One group of Trojans orbits ahead of Jupiter; the other follows the gas giant around the sun. Planetary scientists think the Trojans could have formed at different distances from the sun before getting mixed together in their current homes. The asteroids could also be some of the oldest and most pristine objects in the solar system.</p>





<p>The mission will mark several other firsts, from the types of objects it will visit to the way it powers its instruments. Here are five cool things to know about our first visit to the Trojans.</p>



<h4>1. The Trojan asteroids are a solar system time capsule.</h4>



<p>The Trojans occupy spots known as Lagrangian points, where the gravity from the sun and from Jupiter effectively cancel each other out. That means their orbits are stable for billions of years.</p>



<p>“They were probably placed in their orbits by the final gasp of the planet formation process,” the mission’s principal investigator Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., &nbsp;said September 28 in a news briefing.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean the asteroids are all alike. Scientists can tell from Earth that some Trojans are gray and some are red, indicating that they might have formed in different places before settling in their current orbits. Maybe the gray ones formed closer to the sun, and the red ones formed farther from the sun, Levison speculated.</p>



<p>Studying the Trojans’ similarities and differences can help planetary scientists tease out whether and when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">giant planets moved around</a> before settling into their present positions (<em>SN: 4/20/12</em>). “This is telling us something really fundamental about the formation of the solar system,” Levison said.</p>



<h4>2. The spacecraft will visit more individual objects than any other single spacecraft.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Lucy will visit eight asteroids, including their moons. Over its 12-year mission, it will visit one asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and seven Trojans, two of which are binary systems where a pair of asteroids orbit each other.</p>



<p>“We are going to be visiting the most asteroids ever with one mission,” planetary scientist Cathy Olkin, Lucy’s deputy principal investigator, said in the Oct. 14 briefing.</p>



<p>The spacecraft will observe the asteroids’ composition, shape, gravity and geology for clues to where they formed and how they got to the Lagrangian points.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s first destination, in April 2025, will be an asteroid in the main belt. Next, it will visit five asteroids in the group of Trojans that orbit the sun ahead of Jupiter: Eurybates and its satellite Queta in August 2027; Polymele in September 2027; Leucus in April 2028; and Orus in November 2028. Finally, the spacecraft will shift to Jupiter’s other side and visit the twin asteroids Patroclus and Menoetius in the trailing group of space rocks in March 2033.</p>



<p>The spacecraft won’t land on any of its targets, but it will swoop within 965 kilometers of their surfaces at speeds of 3 to 5 meters per second relative to the asteroids’ speed through space.</p>



<p>There’s no need to worry about collisions while zipping through these asteroid clusters, Levison said. Although there are about 7,000 known Trojans, they’re very far apart. “If you were standing on any one of our targets, you wouldn’t be able to tell you were part of the swarm,” he said.</p>

<h4>3. Lucy will have a weird flight path.</h4>



<p>In order to make so many stops, Lucy will need to take a complex path. First, the spacecraft will swoop past Earth twice to get a gravitational boost from our planet that will help propel it onward to its first asteroid.</p>



<p>The closest Earth flyby, in October 2022, will take it within 300 kilometers of the planet’s surface, closer than the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope and many satellites, Olkin said. Observers on Earth might even be able to see it. “I’m hoping to go near where it flies past and look up and see Lucy flying by a year from now,” she said.</p>



<p>Then in December 2030, after more than a year exploring the “leading” swarm of Trojans, Lucy will come back to the vicinity of Earth for one more boost. That final gravitational slingshot will send the spacecraft to the other side of the sun to visit the “trailing” swarm. This will make Lucy the first spacecraft ever to venture to the outer solar system and come back near Earth again.</p>



<h4>4. Lucy will travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered craft.</h4>



<p>Another record Lucy will break has to do with its power source: the sun. Lucy will run on solar power out to 850 million kilometers away from the sun, making it the farthest-flung solar powered spacecraft ever.</p>



<p>To accomplish that, Lucy has a pair of enormous solar arrays. Each 10-sided array is more than 7.3 meters across and includes about 4,000 solar cells per panel, Lucy project manager Donya Douglas-Bradshaw said in a news briefing on October 13. Standing on one end, Lucy and its solar panels would be as tall as a five-story building.</p>



<p>“It’s a very intricate, sophisticated design,” she said. The advantage of using solar power is that the team can adjust how much power the spacecraft needs based on how far from the sun it is.</p>





<h4>5. The inspiration for Lucy’s name is decidedly earthbound.</h4>



<p>NASA missions are often named for famous scientists, or with acronyms that describe what the mission will do. Lucy, on the other hand, is named after a fossil.</p>



<p>The idea that the Trojans hold secrets to the history of the solar system is part of how the mission got its unusual name. To understand, go back to 1974, when paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and a graduate student <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/human-evolution-origins-fossils-paleoanthropology">discovered a fossil of a human ancestor</a> who had lived 3.2 million years ago. After listening to the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” at camp that night, Johanson’s team named the fossil hominid “Lucy.” (In a poetic echo, the first asteroid the Lucy spacecraft will visit is named Donaldjohanson.)</p>



<p>Planetary scientists hope the study of the Trojans will revolutionize our understanding of the solar system’s history in the same way that studying Lucy’s fossil revolutionized our understanding of human history.</p>



<p>“We think these asteroids are fossils of solar system formation,” Levison said. So his team named the spacecraft after the fossil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spacecraft even carries a diamond in one of its instruments, to help split beams of light. Said planetary scientist Phil Christensen of Arizona State University in Tempe at the Oct. 14 briefing: “We truly are sending a diamond into the sky with Lucy.”</p>

<p>This year, the <strong><a href="https://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a></strong> (APS) increased its contribution fivefold and became the first society to contribute as a Gold Affiliate. In addition to APS, the <strong>Association for Computing Machinery, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Mathematical Society</strong> have all pledged to continue supporting arXiv in 2022. arXiv is grateful for this support.</p>
<p>“For 30 years arXiv has played an essential role in the lives of physicists and other researchers around the world, making their research more open and accessible. APS and arXiv share a common mission to serve the global physics community, advance scientific discovery and research dissemination, and promote education broadly. Both organizations are strongly committed to open access and to sustainable open science initiatives,” said <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/ceo.cfm">Jonathan Bagger, APS CEO</a>. “For these reasons, APS has been a leading supporter of arXiv across the past three decades (even before arXiv was arXiv). We have worked together to ensure arXiv’s uninterrupted service and stability, to integrate services and metadata, and to provide technical advice and other assistance. The new sustainability model enables APS to formalize and reaffirm our commitment. We are proud to be among the first Gold Affiliates, and look forward to continuing our collaboration over the coming decades.”</p>
<p>“arXiv exists thanks to the scientific community, and we are happy to announce the renewed support of professional societies, our partners in serving the scientific community,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv. “We are grateful for their support.”</p>

Cognitive dysfunction in patients with CKD likely results from uremic neurotoxins interacting with neural progenitor cells, the brain vasculature, the lymphatic system, and monoaminergic neurons [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-020-0266-9">1</a>].</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02517-5">Månsson <em>et al.</em></a> set out to examine if having a GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 impacted cognitive development. They specifically looked at the development of dementia or mild cognitive impairment during a 6-year period. They also examined specific cognitive domains: learning and memory, language, complex attention, executive function, perceptual-motor, global cognitive function, and meta-memory. They found that processing speed, a subdomain of complex attention, was affected by kidney disease. There was no statistical significance in dementia or mild cognitive impairment associated with mild renal impairment (mean GFR was 74 mL/min/1.73m2).</p>
<p>Knowing that patients with kidney disease are at risk of cognitive impairment, what can I do to better serve this population as their physician? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414492/">We should provide this population</a> with support and resources including support groups and patient education with the potential to improve outcomes though there is not strong data yet to support this. Providing additional resources like social workers, counseling with pharmacists, and other therapies might prevent adverse outcomes in this group. After reading Månsson<em> et al.</em> article, I know I will work towards recognizing and accommodating mild cognitive impairment in my CKD clinic. I intend to change my practice by giving patients additional time to complete forms during the visit such as intake forms. I frequently provide patient education during a visit, such as low sodium diet, dialysis modalities, etc. This may be better served through going at a slower pace or incorporating a separate visit focused on CKD education instead of speeding through it in a 20-minute follow-up visit. I don’t always write down all of my treatment changes for the patient such as stop this medication or increase this medication, but I will now. I hope to provide written information that they can return to later by typing out my patient instructions more thoroughly or giving handouts on topics we discuss during our education. And finally, repetition is key to allow them to process it in their own time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/barnacles-sea-turtle-shell-movement-cement">Barnacles are famed for not budging. But one species roams its sea turtle hosts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Barnacles aren’t exactly renowned for their athleticism, staying glued in place for much of their lives. But turtle-riding barnacles are fidgety travelers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As adults, the turtle barnacles (<em>Chelonibia testudinaria</em>) can move about 1.4 millimeters a week across turtle shells, researchers report October 6 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </em>Previous observations of barnacles stuck on green sea turtles <a href="http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/archives/mtn119/mtn119p1.shtml?nocount">suggested that the creatures were somehow mobile</a>, propelled by either outside forces or their own actions. But this is the first experimental confirmation that they embark on self-directed treks.</p>



<p>Barnacles start life as free-swimming larvae, eventually settling and adhering to rocks, ship hulls or even the skin of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/barnacles-track-whale-migration">marine mammals</a> (<em>SN: 9/27/16</em>). Some species have been known to rotate on their base or even scooch a smidge when nudged by a too-close neighbor. But once settled in, they live and grow, eating particles of food drifting by what was long considered their permanent address.</p>







<p>Now it turns out some may need forwarding addresses. Benny K.K. Chan, a marine ecologist at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, decided to test <em>C. testudinaria</em>’s mobility experimentally when one of his students successfully transferred turtle barnacles from crabs to an acrylic plate. The team followed 15 transferred barnacles with time-series photography over a year.</p>



<p>Chan’s team also collaborated with researchers in Spain to track the movement of barnacles on the shells of five captive loggerhead sea turtles over a few months and with citizen scientist divers who gathered photos of wild green sea turtles in Taiwan. The team logged the positions &nbsp;of the green turtles’ barnacles over 16 weeks.</p>

<p>Turtle-riding barnacles moved as much as 54 millimeters — a little less than the length of an adult human’s thumb — during this time. Laboratory barnacles moved too, leaving trails of pale cement in layered, crescent-shaped patterns. “We were amazed,” says Chan.</p>



<p>How the barnacles move is still a mystery, but researchers think the crustaceans may partially dissolve their own cement and lift their soft base slightly off the surface. “Then the barnacle can secrete a new cement layer and probably surf on the cement,” says Chan.</p>



<p>The barnacles mostly traveled against the flow of any currents, showing that they weren’t just moving from the pressure of flowing water. They also didn’t get closer together, suggesting that the barnacles are seeking better locations to filter food out of the water rather than mating opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

Chan and Jr-Chi Lin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is rock-solid proof of something that is otherwise anecdotal,” says marine biologist Henrik Glenner at the University of Bergen in Norway , who was not involved with this study.</p>



<p>Barnacles typically exemplify biological competition for space and resources, because after settling they must compete in that spot for the rest of their lives, Glenner says. But being mobile upends this dynamic.</p>



<p>And it raises new questions. Glenner wonders if any barnacles in crowded, intertidal environments might also be capable of movement.&nbsp;And Tara Essock-Burns, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, wants to learn more about the cement itself and its flexible properties. “It is possible that turtle barnacle cement has a very different biochemistry than other barnacles that permanently adhere to [surfaces],” she says. This is precisely what Chan and his team plan on investigating next.</p>



<p>“There is a reason that Darwin was so captivated by barnacles,” says Essock-Burns. “They never cease to amaze us.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-reflection-light-dim-earthshine-moon-solar-radiation">Earth is reflecting less light. It’s not clear if that’s a trend</a></h4>

              
                <p>The amount of sunlight that Earth reflects back into space — measured by the dim glow seen on the dark portions of a crescent moon’s face — has decreased measurably in recent years. Whether the decline in earthshine is a short-term blip or yet another ominous sign for Earth’s climate is up in the air, scientists suggest.</p>



<p>Our planet, on average, typically reflects about 30 percent of the sunlight that shines on it. But a new analysis bolsters previous studies suggesting that Earth’s reflectance has been declining in recent years, says Philip Goode, an astrophysicist at Big Bear Solar Observatory in California. From 1998 to 2017, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL094888">Earth’s reflectance declined about 0.5 percent</a>, the team reported in the Sept. 8 <em>Geophysical Research Letters.</em></p>



<p>Using ground-based instruments at Big Bear, Goode and his colleagues measured earthshine — the light that reflects off our planet, to the moon and then back to Earth — from 1998 to 2017. Because earthshine is most easily gauged when the moon is a slim crescent and the weather is clear, the team collected a mere 801 data points during those 20 years, Goode and his colleagues report.</p>



<p>Much of the decrease in reflectance occurred during the last three years of the two-decade period the team studied, Goode says. Previous analyses of satellite data, he and his colleagues note, hint that the drop in reflectance stems from warmer temperatures along the Pacific coasts of North and South America, which in turn reduced low-altitude cloud cover and exposed the underlying, much darker and less reflective seas.</p>





<p>“Whether or not this is a long-term trend [in Earth’s reflectance] is yet to be seen,” says Edward Schwieterman, a planetary scientist at University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new analysis. “This strengthens the argument for collecting more data,” he says.</p>



<p>Decreased cloudiness over the eastern Pacific isn’t the only thing trimming Earth’s reflectance, or albedo, says Shiv Priyam Raghuraman, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University. Many studies point to a long-term decline in sea ice (especially in the Arctic), ice on land, and tiny pollutants called aerosols — all of which scatter sunlight back into space to cool Earth.</p>



<p>With ice cover declining, Earth is absorbing more radiation. The extra radiation absorbed by Earth in recent decades goes toward warming the oceans and melting more ice, which can contribute to even more warming via a vicious feedback loop, says Schwieterman.</p>



<p>Altogether, Goode and his colleagues estimate, the decline in Earth’s reflectance from 1998 to 2017 means that each square meter of our planet’s surface is absorbing, on average, an extra 0.5 watts of energy. For comparison, the researchers note in their study, planet-warming greenhouse gases and other human activity over the same period boosted energy input to Earth’s surface by an estimated 0.6 watts of energy per square meter. That means the decline in Earth’s reflectance has, over that 20-year period, almost doubled the warming effect our planet experienced.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-giant-planet-orbit-white-dwarf-star-solar-system-future">A Jupiter-like planet orbiting a white dwarf hints at our solar system’s future</a></h4>

              
                <p>A glimpse of our solar system’s future has appeared thousands of light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. There a giant planet like Jupiter orbits a white dwarf, a dim, dense star that once resembled the sun.</p>



<p>In 2010, that star passed in front of a much more distant star. Like a magnifying glass, the white dwarf’s gravity bent the more distant star’s light rays so that they converged on Earth and made the distant star look hundreds of times brighter. A giant planet orbiting the white dwarf star also “microlensed” the distant star’s light, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/754/1/73/meta">revealing the planet’s presence</a>.</p>



<p>In 2015, 2016 and again in 2018 astrophysicist Joshua Blackman of the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia and colleagues pointed the Keck II telescope in Hawaii at the far-off system, which lies some 5,000 to 8,000 light-years from Earth. The team was in search of the giant planet’s star, but saw, well, nothing.</p>



<p>“We expected that we’d see a star similar to the sun,” Blackman says. “And so we spent quite a few years trying to figure out why on Earth we didn’t see the star which we expected to see.”</p>





<p>After failing to detect any light from the spot where the planet’s star should be, Blackman’s team concluded that the object can’t be a typical star like the sun — also known as a main sequence star, which generates energy by converting hydrogen into helium at its center. Instead, the star must be something much fainter. The microlensing data indicate that the star is roughly half as massive as the sun, so the object isn’t massive enough to be a neutron star or black hole. But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03869-6">a white dwarf star fits the bill</a> perfectly, the researchers report online October 13 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“They’ve carefully ruled out the other possible lens stars — neutron stars and black holes and main sequence stars and whatnot,” says Ben Zuckerman, an astronomer at UCLA, who was not involved with the work. He notes that only a handful of planets have ever been found orbiting white dwarfs.</p>



<p>The new planet is the first ever discovered that is orbiting a white dwarf and resembles Jupiter in both its mass and its distance from its star. Blackman’s team estimates that the planet is one to two times as massive as Jupiter and probably lies 2.5 to six times farther from the white dwarf star than Earth does from the sun. For comparison, Jupiter is 5.2 times farther out from the sun than Earth is. The white dwarf is somewhat larger than Earth, which means the planet is much bigger than its host star.</p>



<p>The white dwarf formed after a sunlike star expanded and became a red giant star. Then the red giant ejected its outer layers, exposing its hot core. That former core is the white dwarf star.</p>



<p>Our sun will turn into a white dwarf about <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...418..457S/abstract">7.8 billion years from now</a>, so the new discovery is “a snapshot into the future of our solar system,” Blackman says. As the sun becomes a red giant, it will engulf and destroy its innermost planet, Mercury, and perhaps Venus too. But Mars, Jupiter and more distant planets should survive.</p>



<p>And Earth? No one yet knows what will happen to it.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper &quot;A Cerebellar-Based Solution to the Nondeterministic Time Delay Problem in Robotic Control&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The presence of computation and transmission-variable time delays
within a robotic control loop is a major cause of instability,
hindering safe human-robot interaction (HRI) under these
circumstances. Classical control theory has been adapted to counteract
the presence of such variable delays; however, the solutions provided
to date cannot cope with HRI robotics inherent features. The highly
nonlinear dynamics of HRI cobots (robots intended for human
interaction in collaborative tasks), together with the growing use of
flexible joints and elastic materials providing passive compliance,
prevent traditional control solutions from being applied. Conversely,
human motor control natively deals with low power actuators, nonlinear
dynamics, and variable transmission time delays. The cerebellum,
pivotal to human motor control, is able to predict motor commands by
correlating current and past sensorimotor signals, and to ultimately
compensate for the existing sensorimotor human delay (tens of
milliseconds). This work aims at bridging those inherent features of
cerebellar motor control and current robotic challengestextemdash
namely, compliant control in the presence of variable sensorimotor
delays. We implement a cerebellar-like spiking neural network (SNN)
controller that is adaptive, compliant, and robust to variable
sensorimotor delays by replicating the cerebellar mechanisms that
embrace the presence of biological delays and allow motor learning and
adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">Huge numbers of fish-eating jaguars prowl Brazil’s wetlands</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a tract of central Brazilian wetlands, jaguars spend their days wading through chest-deep waters searching for fish. When not hunting, the big cats playfully grapple with each other back on land. Their life is unlike any other known jaguar population’s existence in the world.</p>



<p>New findings reveal a degree of flexibility in diet and lifestyle <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3543">previously unseen among jaguars</a>. The discovery may provide key context on the cats’ role in food webs, helping scientists better understand the effect of environmental changes on the species, researchers report October 6 in <em>Ecology</em>.  </p>



<p>Jaguars (<em>Panthera onca</em>), which are usually territorial loners that hunt on land, live in a wide array of habitats, ranging from North American deserts to grasslands and tropical rainforests in Central and South America. The cats are also found in the Pantanal, an immense tropical wetland — the largest of its kind in the world — that sprawls over parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists Manoel dos Santos-Filho of the Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso in Cáceres, Brazil, and Carlos Peres of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, knew of rumors of large numbers of jaguars sighted near Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station. That large ecological reserve is located in the remote, northern reaches of the Pantanal.</p>







<p>After relaying these anecdotes to Taal Levi, a wildlife ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, the researchers started a project to better understand the jaguars’ biology and population status in the protected area.</p>



<p>Taiamã is seasonally flooded, with no roads or trails, so the team had to access the reserve by boat, setting up motion-activated cameras along waterways to gather data on jaguar numbers. The area’s abundance of jaguars, however, was obvious immediately.</p>



<p>“You set your foot out of the boat, and there’s a jaguar footprint there already,” says Charlotte Eriksson, a wildlife scientist also at Oregon State University. “There are scratches on trees. There are jaguar scats. There’s just an unbelievable presence of this apex predator wherever you go, which is something I’ve never experienced anywhere before.” </p>



<p>The team deployed 59 cameras, which operated from 2014 to 2018, and collected more than 1,500 videos of jaguars. The researchers also captured 13 jaguars and fitted them with GPS or radio-tracking collars to gain insight into the animals’ population density, movements and social interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on their data, Eriksson and colleagues estimate that the Taiamã Ecological Station hosts the highest density of jaguars ever recorded: 12.4 animals per 100 square kilometers, nearly triple some of the next highest estimates elsewhere.&nbsp;Jaguars were also the most common mammal spotted on the cameras.</p>



<p>Video footage showed jaguars carrying off large fish. When the team analyzed 138 scat samples, the researchers found 55 percent had fish remains in them and 46 percent contained aquatic reptiles, such as caiman or turtles. Just 11 percent contained mammal remains.</p>

</div><figcaption>In Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station, jaguars (<em>Panthera onca</em>) were filmed fishing together in flooded wetlands, carrying off freshly caught fish and playing with each other on land. Elsewhere, the big cats are thought to be territorial loners that hunt mainly on land.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jaguars are well-documented in taking on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/jaguars-armored-prey-no-obstacle">challenging prey</a>, including underwater fare (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/15/16</em>). Eriksson and her team think that the Taiamã felines have not only the most fish-dependent diet among jaguars, but also among all big cats. There are tigers in Bangladesh that live in flooded mangrove forests and sometimes eat fish, but those cats still primarily eat land-based food, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cameras and tracking collars also showed that the Taiamã jaguars were spending a lot of time near each other, sometimes traveling, fishing and playing together. This is all exceptionally odd behavior for jaguars, at least based on what scientists know about the cats elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>In terms of social behavior, “what we knew of jaguars from before this study is basically that they are solitary, and they meet up to mate. And that’s about it,” Eriksson says, noting anecdotes of the cats sharing prey carcasses as rare counterexamples.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="579" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030.jpg" alt="two jaguars lying on the shore" class="wp-image-3104573" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104573">A pair of jaguars rest by the water in their wetland home. Within Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station, there are more jaguars per square kilometer than ever recorded anywhere else.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104573">Charlotte Eriksson, Daniel Kantek</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The profusion of aquatic prey in the flooded preserve — protected from human encroachment — may be responsible for the jaguars’ superlative density and their rich social lives. It’s possible there’s so much food available, Eriksson says, that there is “no real need to fight over it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another idea is that aquatic prey concentrated along the river margins are accessible in only certain areas, Levi says. This may encourage jaguar territories to dissolve, since obtaining access to multiple fishing spots requires getting along with other jaguars. Other animals behave in similar ways. Brown bears, for example, congregate in great numbers to feed at salmon spawning grounds, despite the bears’ typically solitary nature, Levi says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abundance of jaguars and their social behavior is not surprising, given the available food resources, says Todd Fuller, a conservation biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Still, he finds the new information exciting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fuller, who was not involved with the research, says the study helps bring researchers’ understanding of jaguars’ ecology and conservation closer to what’s known about most other large cat species, and “that is a very good thing.”</p>



<p>Jaguars in the Pantanal face many threats and are declining within Brazil, Eriksson says, suffering from drought, fire and agricultural expansion. Evaluating how jaguars might respond to such changes is paramount. In 2020,&nbsp;half of the study area burned, so Eriksson is currently assessing the impact of the fires on the jaguars and their periodically submerged home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also wants to investigate how the Taiamã jaguars’ taste for fish is affecting how often the animals eat land-living prey and what strategies the cats use to catch fish.</p>



<p>“We think we know a lot about these charismatic, large predators,” she says, “but there are still things to learn.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/13/scared-of-spiders-theres-an-app-for-that/">Scared Of Spiders? There’s An App For That</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Specific phobias are incredibly common. According to estimates, around 3‒15% of people will develop one in their lifetime, the majority of whom won’t seek treatment. Phobias can manifest around a huge number of stimuli, such as lightning, dentists, and — most commonly — animals such as spiders.</p>



<p>Although exposure therapy is well established and is very effective at reducing fear and anxiety in those with specific phobias, not many end up accessing treatment. Unsurprisingly, the certainty of being exposed to terrifying things doesn’t entice many people. Even those who do make it into a therapeutic setting are also quite likely to drop out due to the extreme fear caused by these controlled exposures.</p>



<p>However, modern technology may help us to sidestep these issues entirely. Anja Zimmer and team at the University of Basel and Saarland University believe that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088761852100089X?via%3Dihub">the solution may lie in augmented reality</a>.</p>



<span id="more-44083"></span>



<p>Though exposure therapy using virtual reality (VR) technology has been shown by several studies over the last decade to be effective and well tolerated, its rollout has been somewhat underwhelming. Practically speaking, many clinicians cite concerns about motion sickness, costs, or trouble using the hardware. This means that, although VR headsets are now relatively accessible, only the minority of clinicians have chosen to offer this approach as an option.</p>



<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a close relative of VR. Instead of donning a bulky headset, users are able to open their phone cameras and view on-screen virtual objects overlaid on their surroundings in real time. Not only is programming AR experiences much less time intensive (and therefore more cost effective) than doing so in VR, but users are also able to see their own bodies through the camera lens, creating a greater level of engagement with the virtual objects.</p>



<p>These qualities make it a potentially good choice for a new method of delivering exposure therapy. So, in order to test the efficacy of exposure therapy administered via AR, the team designed <em>Phobys</em>, a smartphone based AR app designed to reduce fear of spiders.</p>



<p>Over the course of six 30-minute sessions administered within two weeks, users are able to work through nine short levels of virtual spider exposure. These involve tasks such as looking at the virtual spider, approaching and &#8220;collecting&#8221; them (like in a video game), superimposing spiders onto their hand, and even walking through groups of spiders. After each level, users give a rating of how fearful and disgusted they felt on a scale of 0 to 10; once a rating of 4 is achieved, they can advance to the next level. Perhaps most endearingly, if users get close enough to a spider in the ninth and final level, a kiss sound is triggered and hearts float across the screen. Gamification elements such as this are widely recognised to improve uptake, and are used throughout the levels.</p>



<p>In this study, published in the <em>Journal of Anxiety Disorders</em>, 33 participants (18 diagnosed with arachnophobia) used the <em>Phobys </em>app as recommended. Before and after using the app, they provided responses to several measures of fear: subjective fear ratings when approaching a real spider (a Behavioural Approach Test), the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ), and the Spider Phobia Beliefs Questionnaire (SBQ), as well as a measure of disgust. They were also asked to rate how much they felt that their fears had reduced, post-intervention. A further 33 (17 diagnosed with arachnophobia) participants received no intervention, in order to provide control data.</p>



<p>Analyses of these measures revealed that use of <em>Phobys</em> led to significantly lower subjective levels of fear when approaching real spiders, when compared to controls. Those who had used the AR app were also able to progress further in a Behavioural Approach Test with spiders than those who had received no intervention. The story was similar across all measures — app users subjectively felt less disgusted, scored lower on the FSQ and SBQ, and estimated higher levels of fear reduction than those assigned to the control group.</p>



<p>Since this intervention was completed at home, there were varying levels of uptake. The majority of participants did more than one session (lasting 30 minutes), though some used it for upwards of two hours. Data analysis showed that after an average of only 90 minutes of training with the app, clinically significant improvements in fear were seen — however, the authors note that due to the design of this study, they can’t rule out a contribution from placebo to this effect. That is, users might have expected an improvement from using the app, so they got a short-term boost from using it that’s not necessarily reflective of long-term fear reduction.</p>



<p>Improvements in fear and disgust were seen regardless of whether or not participants crossed the DSM-5 threshold for a specific phobia, meaning that an AR approach may be suitable for all levels of spider fear requiring exposure therapy. Whether AR exposure will work for other types of specific phobia, though, is still somewhat unclear. For example, while spiders can neatly and convincingly be superimposed into environments, larger animals, or even more elaborate experiences such as dental visits, may be tricky to condense into such a small and neat format. Further explorations of whether users are more comfortable with fear stimuli in the long term are also needed. Even so, this study indicates new and highly accessible avenues for exposure therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">Nostalgia may have bona fide benefits in hard times, like the pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over 300 years ago, Swiss physician Johannes Hofer observed disturbing behaviors among Swiss mercenaries fighting in far-flung lands. The soldiers were prone to anorexia, despondency and bouts of weeping. Many attempted suicide. Hofer determined that the mercenaries suffered from what he called “nostalgia,” which he concluded was “a cerebral disease of essentially demonic cause.”</p>



<p>Nowadays, nostalgia’s reputation is much improved. Social psychologists define the emotion — which Hofer saw as synonymous with “homesickness” — as a sentimental longing for meaningful events from one’s past. And research suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/music-therapy-alzheimers-disease-dementia-patients-memory">nostalgia can help people cope</a> with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30149444/">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2020.1825339?journalCode=pcem20">grief</a> and even the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022022120988345">disorientation</a> experienced by immigrants and refugees (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>Nostalgia may even help people cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. In a study published September 8 in <em>Social, Psychological and Personality Science</em>, researchers found when some lonely, unhappy people reminisced about better, pre-pandemic moments, they felt happier. The results suggest that nostalgia can serve as an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211041830">antidote to loneliness</a> during the pandemic, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“A good analogy is the immune system,” says social psychologist Tim Wildschut of the University of Southampton in England. “A viral infection may make you ill, but it also activates your immune system and your immune system makes you better. Loneliness reduces happiness but also triggers nostalgia, and nostalgia increases happiness.”</p>





<p>In the new study, Wildschut and colleagues first surveyed over 3,700 participants in the United States, United Kingdom and China to assess people’s levels of loneliness, nostalgia and happiness during the early days of the pandemic. Surveys varied slightly by country, but for most questions or statements, participants responded on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 for “not at all” and 7 for “very much.” For instance, participants in the United States rated how isolated they felt from the rest of the world in the week prior to the survey, how happy they felt compared with their peers and their overall feelings of nostalgia.</p>



<p>The researchers found that across the three countries, people who scored relatively high in loneliness also, not surprisingly, scored lower in happiness. But when the team drilled down on the role nostalgia plays, they found people who didn’t indulge in those memories were the least happy.</p>



<p>“Loneliness [triggers] unhappiness and nostalgia. Then unhappiness and nostalgia fight with each other,” says coauthor Constantine Sedikides, a social psychologist also at the University of Southampton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in three experiments with new sets of U.S. participants, the researchers manipulated people’s nostalgia levels, using the spring 2020 lockdown as a proxy for heightened loneliness. For example, in one experiment conducted in April 2020, the researchers recruited just over 200 online participants. The team induced nostalgia in half the participants by having them write four words describing a specific nostalgic event from their past. Participants were then prompted to write freely for three minutes about how that past experience made them feel. People in the control group completed the same tasks but about ordinary past experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those experiments revealed that, compared with the control group, participants in the nostalgia group reported slight but statistically significant higher happiness levels, as measured by the same 1-7 scale used in the earlier surveys. For instance, in the experiment with the 200-plus participants, the researchers found that happiness scores in the nostalgia group averaged 5.64 compared with 5.3 in the control group. Statistical analysis suggests that nostalgia can explain about 2 percent of the variation in happiness, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Those results may sound trivial, but even small variations can yield large results when viewed across large populations or across time, says personality psychologist Friedrich Götz of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>“Let’s say you are a happy person every day of your life. Chances are you will have a more fulfilled life than if you are a less happy person,” Götz says. “So 2 percent can make a difference because our happiness influences how we act, feel and think every day of our lives.”</p>

<h3>Nostalgia booster</h3>



<p>Early in the pandemic, researchers tested the impact of nostalgia on happiness. Volunteers were asked to call up a special memory and spend three minutes writing about it. When asked to rate their happiness on a scale of 1 to 7, this group scored slightly higher than volunteers in the control group who were asked to think about an ordinary memory (Time 1). A day or two after the original experiment, researchers asked participants in the nostalgia group to think about their memory again. That “nostalgia booster” once again prompted higher happiness scores (Time 2).</p>

<p>The hope that nostalgia-induced happiness could build up over time underpins some researchers’ long-term goal of harnessing and deploying techniques to trigger nostalgic memories as a form of therapy. Nostalgia can connect people to their past, present and even desired future selves, these researchers say. And since many nostalgic memories often involve other people, they can also help people feel linked to a wider community.</p>



<p>In one study, for example, existential psychologist Clay Routledge and colleagues tapped nostalgia’s social side. Participants first completed an established “nostalgia inventory,” where they rated on a scale from 1 to 5 how nostalgic they felt about 20 aspects of their past lives, such as family and vacations. The researchers then asked people about the types of studies that they might want to participate in later on. Two of those potential studies involved meeting other participants while two others did not. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants reporting high levels of nostalgia, especially those nostalgic for social experiences, were more likely than other participants to select the studies that involved <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26479361/">meeting new people</a>, the researchers reported in the December 2015 <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. That suggests that proneness to remembering meaningful past social experiences engenders future social experiences, the team says.</p>



<p>“Nostalgia isn’t just people remembering time with loved ones,” says Routledge, of North Dakota State University in Fargo. “It’s orienting them toward building new social experiences.”</p>



<p>A key question, though, is if nostalgia’s benefits can persist beyond that fleeting moment of remembrance. Wildschut’s team found that nostalgia’s benefits, in terms of happiness, faded after just a day or two. But nostalgia-induced happiness persisted for a couple days when the researchers reminded people to think about that special memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, nostalgia therapy may not be for everyone. Researchers reported in October 2019 in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> that invoking nostalgia in individuals who viewed relationships as a source of comfort and security <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919303885?via%3Dihub">increased those people’s intention to engage with others</a>. The reverse, however, held true for individuals who saw relationships as a source of pain.</p>



<p>“For these types of avoidant people … nostalgia pushed them in the opposite direction. They were even less likely to want to connect with others on a deeper level,” says existential and social psychologist Andrew Abeyta of Rutgers University–Camden in New Jersey.</p>





<p>Wildschut and colleagues found a similar result when investigating whether invoking nostalgia among Syrian refugees living in Saudi Arabia could increase self-esteem, sense of meaning in life, feelings of social belonging and optimism.</p>



<p>In that study, refugees in an experimental group wrote about meaningful events from their past, while refugees in a control group wrote about ordinary events. The experiment showed that triggering nostalgia in refugees high in resilience — a trait defined by a capacity to withstand and recover from adversity — resulted in more positive emotions than those reported by resilient refugees in a control group, the team concluded in the December 2019 <em>European Journal of Social Psychology</em>. But while inducing nostalgia in refugees low in resilience did help them feel a greater sense of continuity in life and more socially connected compared with a low-resilience control group, nostalgic memories also made them feel <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2590">less optimistic</a> about the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you push the test of nostalgia to those extremes, it’s a very, very tough test,” Wildschut says.</p>



<p>Caveats aside, Wildschut remains optimistic about developing some form of nostalgia therapy. He recalls a conversation with his young daughter many years ago. When he asked her how long nostalgia lasts, she replied “forever,” Wildschut says. “What she meant is that the memory is there, and you can recall it any time.” Ultimately, he and other nostalgia researchers hope to one day identify suitable candidates for nostalgia therapy and then train those people to recall special memories whenever they feel blue.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fastest-spinning-white-dwarf-star-rotation-speed">The fastest-spinning white dwarf ever seen rotates once every 25 seconds</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sun turns once a month and the Earth once a day, but a white dwarf star 2,000 light-years away spins every 25 seconds, beating the old champ by five seconds. That makes it the fastest-spinning star of any sort ever seen — unless you consider such exotic objects as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dance-dead">neutron stars</a> and black holes, some of which spin even faster, to be stars (<em>SN: 3/13/07</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>About as small as Earth but roughly as massive as the sun, a white dwarf is extremely dense. The star’s surface gravity is so great that if you dropped a pebble from a height of a few feet, it would smash into the surface at thousands of miles per hour. The typical white dwarf takes hours or days to spin.</p>



<p>The fast-spinning white dwarf, named LAMOST J0240+1952&nbsp;and located in the constellation Aries, got in a whirl because of its ongoing affair with a red dwarf star that revolves around it. Just as falling water makes a waterwheel turn, so gas falling from the red companion star made the white dwarf twirl.</p>



<p>The discovery occurred the night of August 7, when astronomer Ingrid Pelisoli of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, and her colleagues detected a periodic blip of light from the dim duo. The blip <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11396">repeated every 24.93 seconds</a>, revealing the white dwarf star’s record-breaking rotation period, the researchers report August 26 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>The star’s only known rival is an even faster-spinning object in orbit with the blue star HD 49798. But that rapid rotator’s nature is unclear, with some recent studies saying it is likely a neutron star, not a white dwarf.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>At times, it feels that the world is awash with anger.  From the streets of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to any form of social media you’d care to mention, anger and outrage are seemingly everywhere. New research helps to reveal why this is. It also reveals anger to be itself a Jekyll and Hyde emotion — if we can rid ourselves of the dark, destructive side, what is left can act as a force for good. </p>



<span id="more-44070"></span>



<p><strong>Anger sells</strong></p>



<p>Why is anger everywhere? One reason is that it &#8220;sells&#8221;.&nbsp; There’s plenty of evidence that if you want to go viral online, lacing a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/28/social-media-posts-that-are-hostile-towards-political-opponents-get-more-shares/">social media post with negative emotions — like anger — is the way to go</a>. Social media posts that stir anger against political opponents get more views, and fake news that triggers anger or anxiety is more likely to be spread than real news. In fact, according to the China-based authors of that fake news research (which is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10399.pdf">available as a preprint</a>): “The easier contagion of fake news online can be causally explained by the greater anger it carries.”</p>



<p><strong>People are tired</strong></p>



<p>Poor sleep is common — about a quarter of British adults report suffering from insomnia — and this makes us angrier. As anger can itself worsen sleep, whether sleep disruption also hiked anger was unclear until recently. In 2018, though, <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000522">a US team reported the results of a study</a> exploring the potential impact of a 2-4 hours per night reduction in a person’s normal sleep time over two nights. The team brought this group plus another group of people who had followed their regular sleep routine (averaging about seven hours a night) into the lab. They were subjected to various irritations, like the harsh white noise sound of static. As a group, the sleep-restricted individuals became “substantially” angrier.</p>



<p>There’s evidence of dangers for younger people, too. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/44/5/zsaa253/6007670?redirectedFrom=fulltext">An Australian study of healthy teenagers</a> found that when their night-time sleep was restricted to five hours a night for five nights, this increased anger, confusion and symptoms of depression, and sapped their energy. Even more surprising, perhaps, was that two 10-hour &#8220;recovery nights&#8221; were not enough to reverse these negative changes. &#8220;Given the prevalence of insufficient sleep and the rising incidence of mood disorders and dysregulation in adolescents, our findings highlight the importance of sufficient sleep to mitigate these risks,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/590588">commented researcher Michelle Short</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Triggered</strong></p>



<p>Other everyday experiences hike anger. &#8220;Hanger&#8221; — a term that combines &#8220;hunger&#8221; and &#8220;anger&#8221; — is a well-documented phenomenon. Exactly what accounts for it has been less clear, however. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be triggered by a simple drop in blood sugar levels, according to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000422.pdf">a 2019 study in <em>Emotion</em></a>. Jennifer MacCormack at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and colleagues found that hunger was indeed linked to more negative emotions, including anger, which caused some participants to judge another person more harshly. However, their analysis suggested that this only happens when a person fails to realise that hunger is making them feel bad, and instead mistakenly puts the blame for those negative feelings on something else — like another person’s behaviour. This could make them lash out, instead of fixing the problem by finding something to eat. The team advises paying attention to signals from your body, and, if you’re feeling irritated, mentally checking whether this might be down to hunger. This, they argue, could help with everything from day-to-day social situations to long term mental health.</p>



<p>Some people have more unlikely anger triggers, however. For some, the sound of chewing, slurping, nail clipping or breathing can be enough to send them into an explosive rage. These people suffer from &#8220;misophonia&#8221;, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/17/excessive-mirroring-could-explain-why-people-with-misophonia-react-strongly-to-sounds-of-chewing-or-drinking/">in 2021 a study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></a> provided a fascinating explanation: misophonia isn’t caused by <em>hearing</em> a specific &#8220;trigger sound&#8221; so much as&nbsp; an “over-mirroring” of the other person’s physical actions — and as this over-mirroring is an unpleasant experience, it causes the anger. This insight opens up important potential routes to treatment. Given that misophonia can destroy relationships and even lead to suicide, these are badly needed.</p>



<p><strong>Harmful for health</strong></p>



<p>Too much anger is bad for you, as well as others. <a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/239">Strokes</a> and heart attacks have both been linked to anger outbursts occurring during the preceding few hours. But in raising body-wide inflammation, regular feelings of anger may also hike the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, arthritis and cancer, according to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/pag-pag0000348.pdf">research published in <em>Psychology and Aging</em> in 2019.</a> In fact, anger could be more harmful to older people’s physical health than sadness, according to the team, led by Meaghan A. Barlow at Concordia University, US. The researchers found that, among participants aged 80 or older, at least, those who reported experiencing anger daily had both higher levels of inflammation and more chronic illness. Of course, chronic illness could easily disrupt sleep, which, as we know, increases anger, but this is certainly not the first study to link anger (and the stress hormone cortisol, which is raised during anger) to increased general inflammation. However, anger is not all bad….</p>



<p><strong>The upsides</strong></p>



<p>There are definite upsides to anger. If something in your life or in society is wrong, anger can signal to others that you <em>feel</em> wronged; expressions of anger can be a sign of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/27/we-think-anger-is-a-sign-of-guilt-but-it-may-actually-be-a-better-sign-of-innocence/">innocence in the face of a false accusation</a>, for instance. Anger can also push you into <em>doing</em> something to try to set things right. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000906">2020 study</a> in <em>Emotion </em>provided experimental evidence for this idea. The researchers staged the embezzlement of project funds from a lab. They found that the level of anger felt by a witness to this predicted whether or not they intervened to try to stop it. This study provided evidence of “the important role of anger in the psychological process underlying moral courage,” the team wrote. Of course, a person’s individual moral framework is crucial here, though. If the sight of women venturing outdoors alone or going to work, say, deeply offends you, then your resulting outrage will likely propel you to action, too.</p>



<p>Expressing anger can also make you seem more authentic and sincere. At least, this was suggested by a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883902621000197?via=ihub">2021 study</a> of Kickstarter pitch videos. Entrepreneurs are often encouraged to be only positive about their ventures, commented the researchers. But they found that those who expressed anger and fear as well as happiness had more fundraising success than those who conveyed only happiness. An angry expression can convey how much you care about something, the team explained. If you don’t actually feel angry, you could always fake it, though; I can’t refer to angry &#8220;expressions&#8221; without noting <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/02/a-radical-new-theory-proposes-that-facial-expressions-are-not-emotional-displays-but-tools-for-social-influence/">the compelling theory that facial displays are not emotional expressions but &#8220;tools for social influence&#8221;</a>. However, circumstances can affect our perceptions of anger in others…</p>



<p><strong>Anger and bias</strong></p>



<p>We can misperceive anger. In fact, student teachers in the US are more likely to misperceive Black children as angry than White children, according to a <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000756">2020 paper </a>in <em>Emotion</em>. The 178 prospective teachers in this study watched brief video clips of children aged 9-13 showing happiness, sadness, anger, fear or disgust (as these emotions are conventionally considered to be &#8220;expressed&#8221;). Overall, boys were more likely to be misperceived as angry — rather than afraid, say — than girls. But Black boys and girls were more likely to be misperceived as angry than White children, and Black boys were misperceived most of all. This bias could help to perpetuate racial differences in educational success, argues the team, led by Amy G. Halberstadt at North Caroline State University. The following year, Halberstadt and colleagues published another paper, finding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/06/people-are-more-likely-to-misread-a-black-child-as-angry-when-they-believe-the-child-is-older/">that the older adults believe Black children to be, the more likely they are to (incorrectly) judge them to be angry, too.</a> Perhaps educating student teachers about this bias will help them to avoid it — only future research will tell.</p>



<p>Misperceiving anger is clearly a danger not just for pupil-teacher relationships but all kinds of everyday interactions. But it’s not as though there isn’t much genuine anger in the world to accurately perceive… To twist the title of one of Richard Curtis’s best-known movies, anger actually is all around — but the better we understand it, the more we can channel its positive aspects and take steps to ensure that it helps rather than harms us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-economics-2021-natural-experiments">Methods of getting results from real-world experiments win 2021 economics Nobel</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the most insightful — and now most celebrated — studies of such major social issues as minimum wages and immigration have seized on naturally occurring events. Pioneering efforts by three economists to study <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2021/press-release/">the effects of real-life economic events that mimic controlled laboratory investigations</a> have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.</p>



<p>David Card of the University of California, Berkeley will receive half of the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor (or half of about $1.14 million). The other half will be split by Joshua Angrist of MIT and Guido Imbens of Stanford University. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the prize October 11.</p>



<p>Research by the Nobel Prize winners was instrumental in the development during the 1990s of what are known as natural experiments. These investigations rely on naturally occurring differences between groups or populations that either do or don’t experience specific conditions. In this way, social scientists can study, say, how differences in income affect physical health or how immigration influences employment rates.</p>



<p>Natural experiments are especially important because investigators of key social questions, such as whether pollution slows children’s mental development or whether strong public institutions promote economic growth, often can’t assign people at random to treatment and control conditions. It would be unethical, impractical or both.</p>





<p>“The Nobel winners developed techniques that replicate the idea of truly scientific experiments like you would use to test a vaccine, except [the experiments] occurred in the real world,” says economist Phillip Levine of Wellesley College in Massachusetts. These methods “were at the forefront of a ‘credibility revolution’ in economics” that made the field relevant and understandable to the public, he adds.&nbsp; Levine was a Princeton University graduate student with Angrist, and Card was his thesis adviser.</p>



<p>Natural experiments in economics are related to another influential line of research that examines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/economics-nobel-prize-poverty-science">ways to counteract poverty’s harmful effects using field experiments</a>, work that won the 2019 economics Nobel (<em>SN: 10/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>In a key 1994 paper, Card and the late Princeton economist Alan Krueger <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a84_3ay_3a1994_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a772-93.htm">challenged conventional wisdom in economics</a> that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment. Card and Krueger surveyed fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and a neighboring section of eastern Pennsylvania before and after a minimum wage hike that was instituted only in the Garden State. Full-time employment slightly increased in New Jersey following wage increases, while it declined in Pennsylvania where wages stayed the same.</p>

<p>Further research addressed the complexities of how the minimum wage interacts with employment rates, but it was clear after Card and Krueger’s report that a simple cause-and-effect relationship didn’t exist.</p>



<p>Card also conducted a natural experiment indicating that a huge influx of Cuban refugees to Miami in 1980 did not result in reduced wages and employment for Miami residents with low education levels. That work led Card and others to further explore how new immigration influences the economic standing of native-born citizens and earlier immigrants.</p>



<p>Angrist and Imbens expanded on such work by devising steps to determine under what conditions a natural experiment, such as being given an opportunity to leave school at age 16, affects later outcomes, such as annual income. For instance, the researchers’ method estimated the effect on later income of an additional year of education, which they put at about 9 percent lower for each year lost after age 16, but only for people who chose to leave school early. The estimate excluded earnings histories of individuals who had planned to go to college all along because those people never considered leaving school early.</p>

<p>Card, Angrist and Imbens “have promoted a type of scholarly investigation that is of practical use outside academic journals,” says economist Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland in College Park, who has studied and worked with both Card and Angrist. The Nobel Prize winners’ research equipped social scientists with “tools to credibly draw causal conclusions about empirical relationships.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-evidence-tobacco-use-smoking-pipe-burned-seeds-plants">The earliest evidence of tobacco use dates to over 12,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient North Americans started using tobacco around 12,500 to 12,000 years ago, roughly 9,000 years before <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301664">the oldest indications that they smoked the plant in pipes</a>, a new study finds.</p>



<p>This discovery replaces the pipe-smoking report as the oldest direct evidence for the human use of tobacco anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>Excavations at the Wishbone site in Utah’s Great Salt Lake Desert <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01202-9">uncovered four charred seeds of wild tobacco plants</a> in a small fireplace, say archaeologist Daron Duke of Far Western Anthropological Research Group in Henderson, Nev., and colleagues.</p>



<p>Those seeds, three of which the scientists radiocarbon dated, likely came from plants gathered on foothills or mountains located 13 kilometers or more from the Wishbone area, Duke’s team reports October 11 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>





<p>The site was located in a sprawling marshland at the time of its occupation. Finds in and around the fireplace include bones of ducks and other waterfowl, a long, intact stone point and another point broken in two, a bone implement and seeds of several edible wetland plants.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how ancient North American hunter-gatherers used the tobacco, Duke says. Wads of tobacco leaves, stems and other plant fibers may have been twisted into balls and chewed or sucked, with attached seeds spit out or discarded. Ancestors of Pueblo people in what’s now Arizona <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/2042458214Y.0000000006?journalCode=yjfa20">chewed wild tobacco</a> between around 1,000 and 2,000 years ago. Tobacco smoking can’t be ruled out at the Wishbone site, Duke adds.</p>



<p>The earliest evidence of domesticated tobacco, which comes from South America, dates to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-pacific-northwest-smoked-tobacco-long-europeans-showed">only about 8,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/18</em>). Duke suspects various ancient American populations independently tamed the plant at different times. “Certain groups wound up domesticating particular [tobacco] species, typically alongside food crops,” he suggests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/11/were-more-likely-to-steal-from-large-groups-than-from-individuals/">We’re More Likely To Steal From Large Groups Than From Individuals</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>We’re all aware of the financial disparity that plagues our economic systems. Many of those at the top of large corporations seem content to exploit large groups of people for their own significant financial gain.</p>



<p>Strangely, this is somewhat at odds with previous research in behavioural economics, which tends to find that people are generally quite prosocial, honest, and overall unwilling to steal considerable amounts from others. From results like these, it’s difficult to piece together exactly how we’ve arrived at such levels of financial inequality.</p>



<p>Psychologists have floated a number of potential explanations for this phenomenon. Perhaps those who end up rich have innately higher levels of psychopathy, for example. Or perhaps it’s the case that the cultural norms within certain businesses change the way people make economic decisions. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01170-0">new research</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> from Carlos Alós-Ferrer and colleagues suggests an alternative explanation: when it comes to acting selfishly, we are much more likely to do it at a grand scale than a small one.</p>



<span id="more-44066"></span>



<p>Previous tasks that seek to measure selfishness, such as the Dictator, Ultimatum, and Trust games, all probe how much of a sum a participant will transfer to another person under slightly different conditions and opportunities for personal gain. Responses to such tasks are generally pro-social, with participants often being generous to the other party, and mostly keen to trust them, despite risks to their own gains. But, though these results are generally consistent across previous literature, they don’t resemble the sort of behaviour we see day to day from those with the opportunity to exploit large groups of people.</p>



<p>In order to investigate this mismatch, the research team at the University of Zurich decided to look at how acting upon a larger group of &#8220;victims&#8221; influences a robber’s willingness to be selfish, using a new task called the Big Robber game.</p>



<p>During this game, participants are assigned the role of &#8220;robber&#8221; or &#8220;victim&#8221;. Robbers are asked to choose what portion of the victims’ earnings they wished to take from a group of 16 victims: 0%, 10%, 33%, or 50%.</p>



<p>This new task was administered to 640 student participants alongside Dictator, Ultimatum, and Trust games, where each participant played rounds as both sender and receiver.</p>



<p>After participants had made all of their transactional choices in these tasks, they were presented with the option to donate a freely specified percentage of their earnings to charity. The authors hoped that uptake of this opportunity would be indicative of the emotions participants felt after making their choices. If they felt guilty about their actions, they may choose to give away a higher percentage of their earnings, while lower donations may be indicative of selfishness and a lack of regret.</p>



<p>Analyses showed that the majority of robbers chose to steal from victims. Around 56% decided to take half of victims’ earnings for themselves, and a further 27% chose to take a third of victim’s earnings. Just under 15% elected to take a tenth of the amount, and a staggeringly low 2% declined to steal anything.</p>



<p>A closer look at the time taken to reach these decisions showed that those taking half of victims’ earnings were faster to arrive at their choice than those taking a more moderate third of earnings. Decision times formed an inverse U-shape, suggesting that those choosing extreme decisions may have faced less of a moral struggle than more moderate robbers. Those who robbed half of victims’ earnings also donated less in absolute terms than those who robbed a third. This, the authors believe, is indicative of a lack of guilt about their decision.</p>



<p>This is in stark contrast to the Dictator, Ultimatum and Trust games, during which these same participants were mostly generous and cooperative with the lone other party in the transaction. In all games, the majority of participants who had been robbers declined to take the options that would harm the receiver’s earnings the most, despite it being more profitable to them personally.</p>



<p>Taken together, these results indicate that harming many individuals seems to be easier for us to do than harming just one. The authors suggest that we mentally make a trade-off between our own personal gain and concern for others. If we take a small percentage of earnings from a large group, we’re able to make large financial gains while minimally affecting each individual member of said group. But, if we were to reduce this to a one-on-one transaction, we would have to take magnitudes more of the other party’s earnings to achieve the same profit. This is far more uncomfortable, psychologically speaking, than exploiting the earnings of larger groups, which may explain why we routinely see such behaviour from those at the top of larger organisations.</p>



<p>Future research could investigate whether this effect holds in other demographics, across different cultures, or indeed in less trying economic circumstances than we’ve experienced recently. Explorations of individual differences, such as personality, profession, or financial status, may help further tease apart the factors dictating willingness to steal large amounts during this game. This research represents a timely look at willingness to exploit a large group for personal gain, which may become increasingly relevant in years to come.</p>

<p>Sedimentation of seawater, coupled with elusive behaviour, can make it difficult for ecologists to monitor threatened or elusive species. However, with the development of new molecular technologies, researchers can find more than the eye can see using DNA found within environmental samples.</p>
<p>In a recent study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em>, Ip and colleagues applied environmental DNA (eDNA) technology on seawater to detect shark and ray species in sedimented urban reef environments off Singapore. Historic reports documented a much higher diversity of shark and ray species compared to recent sightings. Therefore, the researchers asked whether local extinction of species had occurred or whether they have become too rare to be detected by traditional visual survey methods. Using eDNA from seawater, the researchers detected twice the number shark and ray species living off the coast of Singapore compared to those typically sighted within the last 20 years and were excited to discover two potentially new species.</p>
<p>In the face of global change, greater knowledge of the planet&#8217;s past and present ecosystems is more important than ever to manage biodiversity loss and set conservation priorities. This study is an excellent example of how advances in environmental DNA technologies is helping us meet this need for knowledge. To learn more about the promise of eDNA technology, please visit <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution&#8217;s</em> new Collection of articles on the topic, which is open to submissions &lt;<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/aedre?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/aedre</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>Hospitals throughout England adapted to tackle the increased demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the UK’s National Health Service performed an unprecedented re-arrangement of resources, including postponing non-urgent procedures and providing video consultations. In March 2020, the UK government then introduced a series of interventions, such as social distancing and instructing people to stay at home under national lockdowns.</p>
<p>However, the impact of these measures introduced to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department (ED) visits in England is relatively unknown, particularly for non-COVID-19 related emergencies. Therefore, Vollmer and colleagues performed an observational study of ED attendances at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) in London to address this need for knowledge.</p>
<p>After the UK government imposed the first national lockdown from March 12, 2020, to May 31 2020, ED attendances at ICHT dropped by 35%, reflecting broader trends across England. This fall in admissions was mainly amongst those younger than 65 years old who arrived by their own means. ED visits by patients without COVID-19 after March 12, 2020, decreased by 48% and no significant change in hospitalisation outcome was observed for these patients. The extent to which these findings relate to avoidance behaviours due to concerns around coronavirus compared to those seeking alternative emergency health services remains unknown.</p>

<p>All the cells within your body contain the same DNA, but each cell type behaves differently. Proteins, including transcription factors and histones, dictate cell identity by binding to DNA to regulate gene expression. Changes in DNA-protein binding, which control gene activity, underlie development and disease. Therefore, it is important for researchers to investigate specific DNA-protein interactions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to achieve this goal. However, ChIP has several flaws, which led Skene and Henikoff to develop a new technique named CUT&amp;RUN (Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease).</p>
<p>In CUT&amp;RUN, targeted DNA-protein complexes are isolated directly from the cell nucleus rather than following a precipitation step. As in ChIP, to perform CUT&amp;RUN, a specific antibody is used to identify the DNA-binding protein of interest. However, in CUT&amp;RUN, an enzyme that recognises the protein-antibody interaction is used to cut out distinct protein-DNA complexes, which can be isolated and sequenced. Therefore, CUT&amp;RUN permits genomic mapping of DNA-protein interactions in much higher resolution using far fewer cells compared to ChIP.</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, it is not always feasible to use the CUT&amp;RUN technique on fresh cells. Therefore, in BMC Research Notes, Boyd and colleagues evaluate how this new method performs using frozen cells. Boyd and colleagues compared a workflow for CUT&amp;RUN with fresh and frozen samples and present an R package named ssvQC for quality control and comparison of data quality derived from this technique. The researchers find that frozen samples serve as a good starting point for performing CUT&amp;RUN for a histone mark (H3K4me3) and a transcription factor (Ikaros).</p>

<p>Cough hypersensitivity is characterised by troublesome coughing triggered by low levels of thermal, mechanical or chemical exposure. For many years, there was no term to describe such coughs with no apparent clinical explanation but this condition has now been named cough hypersensitivity syndrome, giving patients a reassuring and common diagnosis. A better understanding of the risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cough hypersensitivity is needed to identify novel targets to manage the condition.</p>
<p>In the linked paper, Cheng et al. investigate cough induced by capsaicin – a chemical irritant derived from chilli peppers. The researchers compared patients with metabolic syndrome with healthy controls. Metabolic syndrome is the medical term given to patients suffering from a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Interestingly, participants with metabolic syndrome were more sensitive to capsaicin-induced cough compared to controls. The researchers further demonstrate that increased capsaicin-induced cough sensitivity in metabolic syndrome patients is closely related to sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux and speculate that airway inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of increased capsaicin-induced cough sensitivity.</p>

<p>Headaches, including migraines, are one of the most common disorders worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, almost half the adult population have suffered from a headache at least once within the last year. Many complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) have been reported to help treat and manage headache disorders, but do they actually have a clinically beneficial effect?</p>
<p>In BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies, researchers investigate the quantity and quality of CAMs in the context of headache disorders according to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). CPGs describe statements used to assist practitioner decisions about how to care for people with specific conditions. Ng and Hanna searched literature published between 2009 and 2020 to identify CPGs for treating and managing headache and migraine disorders.</p>
<p>Out of 486 unique search results for terms describing headache disorders, 21 search results containing CPGs were eligible and quality assessed. Fifteen of these CPGs mentioned CAM, of which 13 CPGs made CAM recommendations. These findings could help improve the dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals regarding using CAM therapies to treat/ manage headache and migraine disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-dna-ancient-trade-network-arctic-siberia-europe-near-east">Dog DNA reveals ancient trade network connecting the Arctic to the outside world</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Arctic communities traded with the outside world as early as 7,000 years ago, DNA from the remains of Siberian dogs suggests.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of the DNA shows that Arctic pups thousands of years ago were interbreeding with other dogs from Europe and the Near East, even while they and their owners were living in one of the most remote places on Earth. Along with previous archaeological finds, these results suggest that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2100338118">Siberians long ago were connected to a vast trade network</a> that may have extended as far as the Mediterranean and the Caspian Sea, researchers report in the Sept. 28 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Dogs have been valuable commodities in the Arctic for the last 9,500 years and have been used for sledding, hunting, herding reindeer, clothing and food. Because the region is remote, scientists thought local dogs — and their owners — had been completely isolated from the rest of the world for much of that time, an idea supported by the fact that ancient Siberians didn’t exchange much DNA with people outside of the region, says Tatiana Feuerborn, an archaeologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>But previous archaeological evidence — including the discovery of glass beads and other foreign goods entombed alongside 2,000-year-old dogs near the Yamal Peninsula in Russia — suggested that these communities were trading with other cultures beyond the Arctic.</p>

<p>After reading about the archaeological evidence in the news, Feuerborn wanted to see if she could use remains from the 2,000-year-old dogs and others from around Siberia to reveal whether an ancient trade network existed.</p>



<p>Dogs rarely wander far from their humans, meaning researchers can “use dogs to understand human movement, like migrations and even trade interactions,” says Kelsey Witt, a geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. For instance, archaeologists have used ancient dog DNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dog-fossil-domestication-human-path-americas-migration">to push back the arrival date of people</a> in the Americas (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, Feuerborn and colleagues analyzed DNA from the remains of 49 Siberian dogs, ranging from 11,000-year-old bone fragments to fur hoods used by Arctic explorers at the turn of the 20th century. The team found that Siberian dogs — unlike their owners — began mixing with other dog populations from the Eurasian steppes, the Near East and even Europe as far back as 7,000 years ago.</p>



<p>The result suggests that Siberians did bring in dogs from the outside world, Feuerborn says. This trade network could have helped transmit new ideas and technologies, such as metalworking, to the Arctic, and may have facilitated Siberian society’s transition from foraging to reindeer herding in the last 2,000 years. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dogs are a piece of our past,” Feuerborn says. “By looking at them, we can learn something about ourselves.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neanderthals-hunting-catching-birds">How catching birds bare-handed may hint at Neandertals’ hunting tactics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Juan Negro crouched in the shadows just outside a cave, wearing his headlamp. For a brief moment, he wasn’t an ornithologist at the Spanish National Research Council’s Doñana Biological Station in Seville. He was a Neandertal, intent on catching dinner. As he waited in the cold, dark hours of the night, crowlike birds called choughs entered the cave.</p>



<p>The “Neandertal” then stealthily snuck in and began the hunt.</p>



<p>This idea to role-play started with butchered bird bones. Piles of ancient tool- and tooth-nicked choughs bones have been found in the same caves that Neandertals frequented, evidence suggesting that the ancient hominids chowed down on the birds. But catching choughs is tricky. During the day, they fly far to feed on invertebrates, seeds and fruits. At night though, their behavior practically turns them into sitting ducks. The birds roost in groups and often return to the same spot, even if they’ve been disturbed or preyed on there before.</p>







<p>So the question was, how might Neandertals have managed to catch these avian prey?</p>



<p>To find out, Negro and his colleagues decided to act like, well, Neandertals. Wielding bare hands along with butterfly nets and lamps — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">proxy for nets</a> (<em>SN: 04/09/20</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-used-regularly-cooking-300000-years">fire</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/14</em>)&nbsp; that Neandertals may have had at hand— teams of two to 10 researchers silently snuck into caves and other spots across Spain, where the birds roost to see how many choughs they could catch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="503" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg" alt="a person inside a building attempting to catch a bird" class="wp-image-3104497" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-518x383.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-608x450.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-251x186.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104497">Researchers in Spain attempt to capture choughs with their bare hands in roosting sites such as this building. The effort was part of a study to see if Neandertals could have successfully hunted the birds.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104497">J.M. García</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using flashes of light from flashlights to resemble fire, the “Neandertals” dazzled and confused the choughs. The birds typically fled into dead-end areas of the caves, where they could be easily caught, often bare-handed. Hunting expeditions at 70 sites <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.733062/full">snared more than 5,500 birds in all</a>, the researchers report September 9 in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>. The birds were then released unharmed. It was “the most exciting piece of research” Negro says he’s ever done.</p>



<p>The results demonstrate that through teamwork, choughs can be captured without fancy tools at night and offer a likely way that Neandertals could have captured choughs. But actual Neandertal bird-catching behavior remains unknown. If this is in fact how Neandertals hunted, it adds to claims that their behavior and ability to think strategically is more sophisticated than they are often given credit for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="439" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg" alt="several black birds inside a sack" class="wp-image-3104498" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-593x383.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-288x186.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104498">Red-billed choughs, captured as part of an experiment to see if Neandertals could have caught the birds, sit in a sack. The birds were released unharmed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104498">Guillermo Blanco</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The regular catchment of choughs by Neandertals implies a deep knowledge of the ecology of this species, a previous planning for its obtaining, including procurement techniques, and the ability to plan and anticipate dietary needs for the future,” says Ruth Blasco. A taphonomist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, Blasco is an expert in Neandertal diet.</p>



<p>Such role playing, she notes, is “commonly used by scholars as valid analogies to infer processes that happened in the past.” For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-modern-javelin-throwers-hurled-neandertal-spears-hay-bales">reenactments with replicas of wooden spears</a> have suggested that Neandertals could have hurled the weapons to hunt prey at a distance (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers re-creating chough hunts used butterfly nets to catch birds fleeing sites with narrow entrances, as well as bigger nets partially covering larger openings. But “the easiest thing was to grab the birds by hand,” Negro says.</p>



<p>“You have to be intelligent to capture these animals, to process them, to roast and eat them,” he notes. Previous studies have shown that Neandertals may have been similarly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">adept at foraging for seafood</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). “We tend to think that [Neandertals] were brutes with no intelligence,” Negro says, “but in fact, the evidence is accumulating that they were very close to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-rocks-china-lunar-lander-sample-lava-volcano">China’s lunar rock samples show lava flowed on the moon 2 billion years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lava oozed across the moon’s surface just 2 billion years ago, bits of lunar rocks retrieved by China’s Chang’e-5 mission reveal.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis of the volcanic rocks confirms that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957">the moon remained volcanically active</a> far longer that its size would suggest possible, researchers report online October 7 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Chang’e-5 is the first mission <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change-5-mission-moon-rocks-lunar-soil-sample">to retrieve lunar rocks and return them to Earth</a> in over 40 years (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). An international group of researchers found that the rocks formed 2 billion years ago, around when multicellular life first evolved on Earth. That makes them the youngest moon rocks ever collected, says study coauthor Carolyn Crow, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The moon formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Lunar rocks from the Apollo and Soviet missions of the late 1960s and 70s revealed that volcanism on the moon was commonplace for the first billion or so years of its existence, with flows lasting for millions, if not hundreds of millions, of years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="468" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_fk_moon-rock_inline2.jpg" alt="vial containing a moon rock sample" class="wp-image-3104510" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_fk_moon-rock_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_fk_moon-rock_inline2-556x383.jpg 556w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_fk_moon-rock_inline2-654x450.jpg 654w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_fk_moon-rock_inline2-270x186.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104510">Samples of bits of lunar rocks, such as this, are helping scientists study the volcanic evolution of the moon.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104510">Beijing SHRIMP Center/Institute of Geology/CAGS</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Given its size, scientists thought that the moon started cooling off around 3 billion years ago, eventually becoming the quiet, inactive neighbor it is today. Yet a dearth of craters in some regions left scientists scratching their heads. Parts of celestial bodies devoid of volcanism accumulate more and more craters over time, in part because there aren’t lava flows depositing new material that hardens into smooth stretches. The moon’s smoother spots seemed to suggest that volcanism had persisted past the moon’s early history.  </p>



<p>“Young volcanism on a small body like the moon is challenging to explain, because usually small bodies cool fast,” says Juliane Gross, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., not involved in the study.</p>





<p>Scientists had suggested that radioactive elements might offer an explanation for later volcanism. Radioactive decay generates a lot of heat, which is why nuclear reactors are kept in water. Enough radioactive materials in the moon’s mantle, the layer just below the visible crust, would have provided a heat source that could explain younger lava flows.</p>



<p>To test this theory, the Chang’e-5 lander gathered chunks of basalt — a type of rock that forms from volcanic activity — from a previously unexplored part of the moon thought to be younger than 3 billion years old. The team determined that the rocks formed from lava flows 2 billion years ago, but chemical analysis did not yield the concentration of radioactive elements one would expect if radioactive decay were to explain the volcanism.</p>

The lunar material is the first brought back to Earth in more than 40 years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104509">Chinese National Space Agency’s Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This finding is compelling scientists to consider what other forces could have maintained volcanic activity on the moon.</p>



<p>One theory, says study coauthor Alexander Nemchin, a planetary scientist at the Beijing SHRIMP Center and Curtin University in Bentley, Australia, is that gravitational forces from the Earth could have liquefied the lunar interior, keeping lunar magma flowing for another billion or so years past when it should have stopped.</p>



<p>“The moon was a lot closer 2 billion years ago,” Nemchin explains. As the moon slowly inched away from the Earth — a slow escape still at work today — these forces would have become less and less powerful until volcanism eventually petered out.</p>





<p>Impacts from asteroids and comets also could have kept the moon’s volcanic juices flowing, but “at this point, any guess is a good guess,” says Jessica Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“This is a good example of why we need to get to know our closest neighbor,” Barnes says. “A lot of people think we already know what’s going on with the moon, but it’s actually quite mysterious.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/g_ChPbTdgoY/">Following through on our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">my predecessor outlined</a> five key areas in which PLOS would redouble its efforts to make our journals a home for diverse voices. So how have we done?</p>



<p>Establishing our baseline was up first: we&rsquo;ve started to manually collate demographic data, while building new tech to streamline the process and ensure personal privacy is protected. Data about PLOS&rsquo; in-house leadership team are already feeding into hiring practices aimed at increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees. And a survey of our 10,000-strong Editorial Board members will be deployed soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An updated workflow for recruitment of new Editorial Board members ensures we&rsquo;re casting a wider net. (Want to be considered? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board">Sign-up here</a>!) Our new editorial partners are helping us publish more research on inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations. Recent Collections on <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-gender-diversity/">Health &amp; Health Care in Gender Diverse Communities</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-inequities/">Health Inequities and Disparities Research</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/human-trafficking/">Trafficking, Exploitation and Health</a> and <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/diagnostic-tests-low-resource/">Diagnostic Tests in Low-Resource Settings</a> showcase these efforts.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/announcing-the-plos-scientific-advisory-council/">PLOS Scientific Advisory Council</a> is bringing the expertise of active researchers at different career stages and geographic areas to bear on organisational strategy. A key strategic pillar has been <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">the launch of new journals</a>: <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, <em>PLOS Water</em>, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>. Unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges from diverse, local perspectives, the new journals help us expand our international footprint. In this way, we ensure that we&rsquo;re co-creating&mdash;not dictating&mdash;paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities. Formal partnerships, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/partnering-with-tcc-africa/">such as that with TCC Africa</a>, are another way in which local needs can more-fully inform our ways of working.</p>



<p>Moving upstream in the research cycle, we&rsquo;re hoping to help inculcate change in the way research is conducted, as well as how it&rsquo;s communicated. A <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy on inclusivity in global research</a> has just been rolled out. &lsquo;Parachute&rsquo; or &lsquo;helicopter research&rsquo; occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their studies and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants. Prompting PLOS authors to consider these issues is a small first step towards addressing neo-colonialism in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That publishing open access allows the benefits of research to be realised by a broader range of stakeholders is undeniable. But the predominant business model&mdash;an article-processing charge (APC) paid by an individual researcher&mdash;is a key stumbling block to participation. So PLOS has been experimenting with new payment paradigms. Our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">new Global Equity</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> models, for example, expand equitable partnership opportunities for researchers&rsquo; institutions to eliminate author-facing charges. Global Equity provides affordable pricing tiers reflective of regional economies in every area of the world while Community Action Publishing more fairly distributes the cost of selective publishing.</p>



<p>As well as working on our own policies, processes and people, we&rsquo;ll continue to use our platforms to amplify the voices of others who are working to dismantle structural inequities. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing more, check out the <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/">inclusion-themed discussions</a> that were part of our recent <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/">Scientists for Open Science</a> event. Or blog posts describing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/06/the-ocean-womxn-program-supporting-a-new-generation-of-black-oceanographers/">support for a new generation of black oceanographers </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/the-human-evolution-research-institute-challenging-traditional-narratives-and-fostering-a-new-generation-of-black-women-in-the-palaeosciences/">women in the palaeosciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve made a great start on our commitments&mdash;but there&rsquo;s much more to do. A newly-created Steering Committee will oversee all PLOS&rsquo; DEI-related initiatives, and we&rsquo;ll continue to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/2021-dei-goals-update/">report our progress to you</a>. As someone who&rsquo;s only recently joined PLOS, it&rsquo;s so refreshing to see DEI being truly centered, initiatives being properly resourced, and organisation-wide priority being given to this important work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-alumni-2021">How our SN 10 scientists have responded to tumultuous times</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Each year since 2015, <em>Science New</em>s has featured the work of outstanding early- and mid-career scientists in our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">SN 10: Scientists to Watch list</a>. They’re nominated by Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences, and are recognized because of their curiosity, passion, determination and, of course, their discoveries.</p>



<p>But we decided that 2021 begs for something different. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">coronavirus pandemic</a> continues to rage worldwide, with its burdens falling hardest on those least able to bear them — inequities already on our minds due to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and other social movements. At the same time, we’re learning that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the window to reverse some of climate change’s most devastating effects is closing fast</a>. With all the upheaval, we wondered: How do these extraordinary times change a scientist’s work?</p>



<p>Here, we catch up with 10 noteworthy Scientists to Watch alumni. Emily Fischer, who studies wildfire smoke, has faced the threat of fires firsthand, cognitive neuroscientist Jessica Cantlon is fighting sexual harassment in the sciences and economist Parag Pathak is taking his efforts to make institutions more equitable from schools to hospitals. Other scientists reveal how their work has gained new urgency and meaning for them. The interviews that follow have been edited for length and clarity. </p>

<h4>Jessica Cantlon</h4>



<p><strong>Cognitive neuroscientist<br>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>



<p>Jessica Cantlon, featured in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jessica-cantlon-cognitive-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">studies the evolution and development of complex mathematical thinking</a>, including the traits that set humans apart from other primates. In 2017, she was recognized as a <em>Time</em> Person of the Year, as <a href="https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/">a “silence breaker”</a> speaking out against sexual harassment during the height of the #MeToo movement.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your research since 2016?</h5>



<p>We’ve expanded our repertoire to compare people across different cultures, who have different educational practices. We’ve been going to Bolivia to work with this group of people called the Tsimane, who live in rural parts of the Amazon forest. They don’t have the rigid, formal schooling where kids go through these particular curricula to achieve mathematical cognition. Instead, education there is more organic and more deeply connected to their way of life. That allows us to try to understand what effect does a particular type of education have on numerical thinking.</p>



<p>There was one study that we did, comparing species — nonhuman primates and humans — to understand the evolution of these concepts. Across all species and stages of development and cultural groups, there’s this bias that when you’re looking at a set of objects, and you’re trying to quantify it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13968">you think about that set numerically</a>. And you don’t have to; you can think about that set of objects spatially, as an amount of stuff, you can think about how much surface area is there, or the perimeter around it. But primates, including humans, [tend to] think about that set as a set of discrete objects, and count them up.</p>



<h5>What is something that excites you right now in your work?</h5>



<p>We’ve looked at the similarities and differences between boys and girls as their brains develop. We’ve done some of the first, early studies comparing children’s brains that can truly allow us to collect evidence on the trajectory of similarity between boys and girls…. We’ve shown that very early in development, between around 3 and 8 years of age, there’s evidence during mathematical processing that most of the brain — over 95 percent — shows functional similarity in that processing between boys and girls.</p>



<p>But as we know, much later on in development, we see a severe underrepresentation of girls in mathematics-related fields. What’s happening? There’s evidence in the field … that what happens in late childhood and adolescence is that children’s interests are shaped culturally.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2016?</h5>



<p>In 2016, [some of my colleagues at the University of Rochester and I] filed a sexual harassment complaint against a faculty member in our department who was sexually harassing women — undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. It became this situation that hijacked my career for a number of years.… We went public with our complaint, partly to protect ourselves, but also partly to let people know at other universities that this kind of thing is happening to students, and it’s affecting women’s career paths in ways that are discriminatory and unequal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was really important. Our complaint went public in September of 2017. In October 2017, the Harvey Weinstein story came out in the <em>New York Times</em>, and that kicked off a series of reactions that ultimately culminated in millions of people saying #MeToo, which I think was really powerful and important, and was something that we got to be a part of.</p>



<p>I’ve had dozens of women reach out to me for advice, about how to file a complaint at their university, how to take legal action, if that’s what they’re thinking, what the risks and benefits are. And so, part of my career now — and I’m excited by it, and I think it’s really important work — is to be an advocate for women who are experiencing discrimination and harassment at universities.</p>



<p>One response that we thought was really great was that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24994/chapter/1">did a full study on sexual harassment in the sciences</a>…. It has a lot of ideas about what might effect larger-scale change. </p>

<h4>Parag Pathak</h4>



<p><strong>Economist</strong><br><strong>MIT</strong></p>



<p>Parag Pathak, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parag-pathak-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">strives to make public education more equitable</a>. He has used data and algorithms to overhaul school choice systems in Boston, New York and other U.S. cities. Now he’s applying his research to the question of how to equitably distribute vaccines and other medical resources.</p>



<h5>What’s the most notable progress in your work since 2019?</h5>



<p>Since we last talked, I released a paper on <a href="https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/the-long-term-effects-of-universal-preschool-in-boston/">the effects of universal preschool</a>. A lot of people are interested right now because [universal preschool, which is open to everyone with no income rule,] is part of the White House’s agenda. Because of the work we had done with Boston with their school choice algorithm over the years, we had some files on school admissions going back to the late 1990s. Boston was a leader nationwide in expanding slots for children in preschool. But, like many cities, there weren’t enough slots for demand, so they had to ration. And that’s where the lotteries come in.</p>



<p>Fast forward to now. We linked these applicant cohorts to standardized test scores and educational outcomes all the way into college. And what we found was pretty exciting: Those who won the [preschool] lottery are more likely to graduate high school, they score higher on SATs and they’re more likely to enroll in college. Boston has continued to refine and try to improve [the lottery system]. It’s a model for other cities that are expanding public preschool.</p>



<h5>Are you pursuing any new questions or projects?</h5>



<p>COVID-19 was this huge shock. We all were looking around for how we could be useful, using our respective toolboxes. Tayfun Sönmez, M.&nbsp;Utku Ünver and M. Bumin Yenmez, all of Boston College — the four of us — started to study how scarce medical resources are rationed. And it turns out, there are some parallels with the way school seats are rationed.</p>



<p>One of the ideas that we’ve explored is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00374">the idea of a reserve system</a>. In cases where people can’t agree on what’s fair, who should get a vaccine first? It’s very similar to who should get into a school. And the way that [schools] have handled that is they set up more elaborate versions of priority systems. With a vaccine reserve system, you basically have a [supply] that’s reserved for cardiac communities, and one that’s reserved for frontline medical personnel, so on and so forth…. States like California and Massachusetts have used some of our ideas [for their reserve systems].</p>



<p>My wife [Ruma Rajbhandari] is a medical doctor, and my sister [Sapana Adhikari] is an emergency room physician. A big part of my interest in medical rationing guidelines was their having to go to the hospital in March 2020 not knowing what the risks were and not having personal protective equipment. That was something that got me really keen on this debate about frontline health care workers, do they get first priority or not?</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic shifted how you view your work in the area of education?</h5>



<p>I have a kindergartner who was virtual this past year. And he did an amazing job with it. I think what the pandemic has done is rip the Band-Aid off on these lingering problems in society — inequitable access to health care, inequitable access to education, inefficiencies in both of the systems — and has made them much more pronounced. That’s been the theme of our research throughout. We hope more people take these issues on, because the way COVID-19 played out was really a scarring event in terms of haves and the have-nots. </p>

<h4>Jenny Tung</h4>



<p><strong>Evolutionary anthropologist</strong><br><strong>Duke University</strong></p>



<p>Jenny Tung, featured in 2018, studies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jenny-tung-sn-10-scientists-watch">how social environments </a>— including social status, relationships and isolation — influence primates’ genes and health. Her study subjects have included captive rhesus macaques and wild baboons.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your work since 2018?</h5>



<p>We have built layers of complexity onto [our] initial story. A few years ago we were showing that it’s possible for social interactions to have profound effects on the function of our genome. And now we’re trying to derive a much better understanding of how and why and when, and what are the exceptions.</p>



<p>The other thing I’m really excited about is our ability to move away from this very powerful but very artificial system using captive primates and to ask about what’s going on in the field with wild monkeys. I’ve studied wild baboons in Kenya for many, many years. We know a lot about the social environments, the social experiences. And now with the ability to collect some simple blood samples, we’re also seeing strong signatures of things like social status and social integration, social bonds, social connectedness in the function of these animals’ genomes. That’s pretty exciting because lab studies are powerful and wonderful, but there’s always this question of, “Well, is this real in the real world?”</p>



<h5>You were named a <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2019/jenny-tung">MacArthur Fellow in 2019</a>. What have you been pursuing since?</h5>



<p>It was a real honor. It has encouraged us to continue down some of these paths … and to also do some more comparative work and think about species beyond the ones that I have traditionally studied. So in the past few years, I’ve picked up work in other social mammals — wild meerkats and these very social rodents called mole rats — that have their own advantages in giving us insight into how our social world has shaped both how we came to be, our evolutionary past, and how we do day to day in our present.</p>



<p>I’ve been doing more work on something that’s an old love of mine: trying to understand the evolutionary consequences of intermixing between different primates. The population of baboons that I study in Kenya actually sits right at the edge of where the ranges of two different species of baboons meet. And so this population is intermixed between one species, the Anubis baboon, and this other species, the yellow baboon.… We think those patterns of intermixture influence some things about what [the animals] look like, how they behave and so on.… </p>



<p>We know that [humans] have also intermixed a lot with some groups that don’t even exist today, like Neandertals and Denisovans. That process of admixture that we observe right now in living primates [is] potentially relevant to understanding our species’s history.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>In many ways, I felt very fortunate during the pandemic; as an academic with tenure, I have a secure job. But we were also home with a 3-year-old for a long stretch. I spend usually at least a month a year in Kenya, and I have since 2006. But not in 2020. We had to figure out some way of keeping [the research] continuous without any ability to travel there. We have a permanent staff in Kenya — they are Kenyan — who are very important to us and have been working with our project in some cases for many decades, and they were having their own issues, and isolation, and risks in the face of a lot of uncertainty. </p>



<p>I spend a lot of time in my research life thinking about social interactions. And every species that I study … they live in groups. And humans, to a large extent, we live together. We didn’t evolve to be on our own for a long period of time. And so I spent a lot of time reading and thinking and working on, “Why when you don’t have the right sort of social connections, why does your risk of death just shoot up? What’s the consequence of chronic social stress?” One of the things that I really appreciate in a more visceral manner [now] is how important my social network is to me. I think that we’re all looking for ways to connect during the pandemic. And that’s when your personal experience and the things that you’re writing papers about and thinking about really collide. </p>

<h4>Isaac Kinde</h4>



<p><strong>Molecular biologist<br>Thrive Early Detection</strong></p>



<p>Isaac Kinde, featured in 2015, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/isaac-kinde-finding-cancer-altered-genes">developing tests to detect cancer early</a>, when treatment is more likely to be successful. In 2019, PapGene, a small biotech start-up where he was chief scientific officer, was acquired by Thrive, cofounded by Kinde. Just this year, it got the backing of the much larger cancer diagnostics firm Exact Sciences.</p>



<h5>Could you tell us about Thrive and what spurred this transition?</h5>



<p>Thrive basically acquired the predecessor company [PapGene]…. There was a lot more money, there’s a lot more expertise, but the core mission didn’t change, which is to develop cancer diagnostic products that we think will have an impact on the lives of people with cancer. We have essentially turbocharged and focused our efforts, leading with the most promising product, which is CancerSEEK.</p>



<p>The premise is we can reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through earlier detection. CancerSEEK is a blood test, and it is a multi-cancer test. That contrasts with the current paradigm, which is one test, one cancer.… Right now, all of our efforts are on making it commercially available.</p>



<h5>CancerSEEK, which is still in testing, picks up on DNA mutations and proteins associated with cancer. How many cancers can it detect at this time?</h5>



<p>There’s good evidence for detecting over 60 to 70&nbsp;percent of the cancers that cause the most deaths per year. That boils down to … colon, breast, lung…. But the [full] range is bigger than those three. There’s esophageal, gastric, kidney, pancreatic. There’s data that support maybe 12 to 13 different cancers.</p>



<h5>You published what you’ve referred to as a “landmark study” in <em>Science</em> last year. What did it find?</h5>



<p>We call it <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6499/eabb9601">a landmark study</a> because it was the first demonstration in a prospective setting of how a multicancer blood test could be used in real time to report results to patients with cancer.</p>



<p>We looked at 10,000 women in the Geisinger Health system. It’s primarily women who are in Pennsylvania…. In the study, 24 [women had cancers] detected with standard-of-care screening: colonoscopy, mammography or low-dose CT scan for lung. Then there were 26 cancers in which the CancerSEEK test detected the cancer first…. Sixty-five percent of the cancers we detected were at a stage prior to stage 4. So [the addition of CancerSEEK] doubled the number of cases that were [found before symptoms were reported] — in many, many cases early enough where some effective therapies could be implemented.</p>



<p>And then it was also safe…. There were very few false positives, and we could very quickly resolve the false positives with whole-body PET-CT imaging. At least two patients [who first had detections from CancerSEEK] had their cancers successfully removed and are thriving as of the last time we checked.</p>



<h5>Routine cancer screenings fell during the pandemic. Has this affected your work?</h5>



<p>It fans the flame, right? The reason why cancer screening went down is not because there was less cancer. It was [just] more difficult for whatever reason to get the appropriate standard-of-care test.… All this did was just strengthen the case that more tools, easier tools are needed for cancer screening. And I think maybe the other feeling is just wishing we could go even faster, but balancing a commercial launch with having all the right pieces in place that will set us up for success.</p>

<h4>Luhan Yang</h4>



<p><strong>Biologist</strong><br><strong>Qihan Biotech</strong></p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/luhan-yang-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featured in 2017</a>, Luhan Yang had cofounded and was chief scientific officer of <a href="https://www.egenesisbio.com/">eGenesis</a>, a biotech start-up. She is now cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.qihanbio.com/">Qihan Biotech</a>, based in Hangzhou, China, which aims to develop animal organs that are safe for human transplant and to make cell therapies that can treat conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases more widely accessible.</p>



<h5>What is some of the most notable progress in your work since 2017?</h5>



<p>The concept of xenotransplantation is to use animal organs as an alternative resource for human transplantation, since there is a huge unmet need for organs. There are two fundamental issues to be addressed. One is [that] there are endogenous retroviruses in the pig genome — some virus sequences — and they can jump around within the pig genome. The viruses can also jump from the pig cell to the human cell. So there is a potential cross-species transmission, which is a huge safety and regulatory concern.… The second hurdle of using pig organs for human transplant, as you can imagine, is rejection, and it is tremendous.</p>



<p>Those are the two fundamental problems … and that’s where we think gene editing can come into play. By 2017, our team had knocked out 62 [retrovirus copies]. Since then, there are three notable milestones: First, we have created our Pig 2.0, with 15 modifications for immunology…. Last year in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00613-9"><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em></a>, we showed that those modifications are properly expressed in the pig cell, and the resulting pig is healthy, as well as fertile, and the genetic modification can be passed to the offspring. The second part is we combined the [retrovirus] knockout and the immune rejection–related modification in a single pig. We call it Pig 3.0. So that is a prototype close to clinical trial.</p>



<p>The third part is the most exciting part for us: We need to test the function. [In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331749/">a recent study published in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em></a>,] we put the pig kidney into a monkey. If it’s a normal pig kidney, it will be rejected in a few minutes. And right now the longest survival of our monkey is about one year.… The monkey experiment demonstrates the possibility of achieving long-term xenotransplantation.</p>



<h5>What was it like to move from the lab to leading a company?</h5>



<p>Being a leader in biotech is not all business. There are three components that are needed. The first part is to set the vision and strategy of the company. In such an innovative area, I think the scientific knowledge, the breadth of the exposure, I think that’s my strength.… The second part is to recruit, retain and train people. And the last part is some business judgment, like how to do fund-raising, how to organize a project, the accounting. I have to admit, I’m not the expert. But I think at my position, the key is to recruit the best people to do the job.… And I started to embrace that every leader has different strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic influenced your company’s international collaborations?</h5>



<p>I was hoping we could have more in-person meetings or travels, but right now, China still has the quarantine policy that makes it super inconvenient for international travel. Hopefully with the vaccine, the world will become what it was.</p>



<p>I feel the world is more divided compared with 10 years before. And I hope at least for medicine, we can see that our enemy is not a different country, but our enemy is cancer, is organ failure, is COVID, that we can keep and strengthen the collaboration across borders. </p>

<h4>Jeremy Freeman</h4>



<p><strong>Scientist and designer</strong><br><strong>CarbonPlan</strong></p>



<p>When he was featured in 2016, Jeremy Freeman was developing new tools and methods to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jeremy-freeman-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">help scientists better analyze brain data</a>. Now he is executive director of <a href="https://carbonplan.org/">CarbonPlan</a>, a nonprofit organization that he founded in March 2020 to tackle the climate crisis through open-source data and research.</p>



<h5>You’ve shifted gears since 2016. Tell us about it.</h5>



<p>I moved very far from neuroscience, and I’m now exclusively working on climate change. Our focus [at CarbonPlan] is the scientific integrity and transparency of climate solutions. [We do] a combination of research on different areas of climate science and strategies for addressing climate change. We [also] produce a variety of resources and tools for both the research community and the public at large.</p>



<p>Despite being a radically different field, there are some interesting commonalities, in terms of the value of having very accessible, open, publicly available data that speaks to critical issues. [For climate change,] issues around both what is changing in the climate and how we might address that, in different strategies we might take. Having as much of that information be developed in the open, in a way that others can contribute to, and making work available for others to read and evaluate and criticize and engage with — those are [also] values I felt really strongly about in the world of biomedical science.</p>



<h5>What CarbonPlan work are you most proud of right now?</h5>



<p>We have done a lot of analysis identifying very specific ways in which the implementation of forest carbon offset programs [the planting or preservation of trees to attempt to compensate for carbon emissions] haven’t worked. We did a comprehensive analysis of the role of forest carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade program, which is a massive sort of market of offsets on the order of $2 billion, and we identified about $400 million worth of offset credits that in our analysis do not reflect real climate benefits because of errors in how they were calculated with respect to issues that involve fundamental problems in statistics and ecology.</p>



<p>That team effort, led by Grayson Badgley and Danny Cullenward, along with a lot of other work that we’ve done on the role of offsets, is really starting to change the conversation, and wake people up to the fact that these approaches to dealing with climate change haven’t been working.</p>



<h5>What other questions are you looking at?</h5>



<p>There’s an area known as carbon removal, which refers to any mechanisms that draw down CO<sub>2</sub><strong><sub> </sub></strong>from the atmosphere. And carbon removal is really, really complicated, because there are a&nbsp;lot of different ways to potentially accomplish that.… So that’s an area where we’ve been very involved, studying, analyzing, comparing. We helped write, edit and produce <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/">a book called the <em>CDR&nbsp;Primer</em></a> — carbon dioxide removal primer. It’s, of course, a publicly available resource.</p>



<h5>Have recent social justice movements influenced your work?</h5>



<p>Absolutely.… Climate change is so fundamentally an issue of equity and an issue of justice. The burdens of climate change are going to be borne by those who were not directly responsible for it, and those who in many ways have been responsible for it will be more able to avoid its impacts. And there’s a deep injustice in that.… How to think about that is an important aspect of our work.… We’re interested in finding a way to be really complementary to a lot of existing community efforts around these issues. </p>

<h4>Paula Jofré</h4>



<p><strong>Astrophysicist</strong><br><strong>Universidad Diego Portales</strong></p>



<p>Paula Jofré, featured in 2018, used the chemical composition of stars across the Milky Way like DNA to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paula-jofre-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">map the stars’ family tree</a>. She recently filled in some details of the tree — and is filling a gap in the publishing world by writing a book about stars in Spanish.</p>



<h5>What progress have you made on your stellar family tree?</h5>



<p>In the first paper, <a href="http://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/467/1/1140/2966869">the tree had three main branches</a>. There was one that we could associate with a young thin disk, which is one of the populations in the Milky Way. Another was associated with an old, thick disk, which was the older component of the Milky Way. And then we had something in between…. Now, because we had more stars and more chemical elements and we made a better selection of which chemical elements to include, we could find that this strange population was actually an ancestor population of the thin disk. And one of the interpretations we had in the second paper [published in January in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>] <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/32/6081048">was that they were produced all very quickly</a>.</p>



<p>Other groups have found striking evidence of a galaxy that was merged into the Milky Way [billions of years ago]. And that [merging and mixing of gas] could have triggered what is called a star formation burst — lots of stars [forming] at the same time. So, it’s kind of exciting that we find in the tree a feature that could be attributed to a star formation burst … a few gigayears after the [merger of these two galaxies] that we know happened.</p>



<h5>You’re also writing a popular book on stars. Can you tell me more about the book,<em> Fósiles del cosmos: descifrando la historia de la Vía Láctea</em>, or <em>Fossils of the Cosmos: Deciphering the History of the Milky Way</em>, and why you decided to write it?</h5>



<p>It’s going to be published in November [in Chile]. It’s a book in Spanish for the public. I am teaching a class about stars in the Milky Way, a general astronomy class. And I’ve been finding that there is no proper literature in Spanish for the students.… The level is sometimes way too basic or too complex. So I wanted to write something for their level.</p>



<p>[The book] explains how stars create the chemical elements, what’s the role of Gaia [a satellite mission to map the galaxy], what’s the role of the Milky Way Mapper [another survey using Earth-based telescopes], about all these big surveys, why we care, what’s going on.</p>



<p>When I started writing it, of course, I started reading other books…. In all these general astronomy books, women are never highlighted. In my book, I have lots of quotes from 40 different women all around the world, working in my field.… I want to make the point that you can be a woman, you can be clever, you can dedicate yourself to something that is mentally challenging. You can be like any of these 40 women.</p>



<h5>What’s the greatest challenge that you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>The biggest challenge has been to promote hiring more women at the faculty level. Chile’s a very small country and they love new figures, young figures being highlighted by the United States. The moment I was in <em>Science News</em>,I became very popular [in Chile] very quickly. They needed the inspirational woman. And I kept saying, “I don’t want to be the only one. I want more women.”</p>



<p>I don’t know if you were aware of this collective Las Tesis; they made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB7r6hdo3W4">a dance for the social unrest that we had in Chile</a> before the pandemic. It was a feminist movement that resonated for so many people in the world. The movement [says]: We want to be treated with respect, we want the same salary, we want the same opportunities, we want to feel safe on the streets.… But then, when you are fewer in academia, you’re not going to start jumping on the table and dancing, right? You have to argue … it’s difficult. </p>

<h4>Stanley Qi</h4>



<p><strong>Bioengineer</strong><br><strong>Stanford University</strong></p>



<p>By disabling the DNA-cutting enzyme in the CRISPR system, Stanley Qi, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stanley-qi-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">created a new and versatile tool</a>. Attaching a range of molecules to these “dead Cas” enzymes has yielded an entire toolbox worth of DNA and RNA manipulators.</p>



<h5>Is the strategy of disabling Cas molecules still popular among researchers?</h5>



<p>I feel it’s getting more popular, for a number of reasons: One, people use … this tool to study how the genome works. Two, there are some new efforts using the tool to treat some genetic diseases. And three, there are some other exciting uses of this tool to think about other diseases, other topics that we can possibly tackle.</p>



<p>For example, this CRISPR system came from bacteria cells, right? They were used as weapons by the bacteria to fight against invading viruses. So we said, “OK, humans also have many foes like invading viruses. Can we repurpose this CRISPR to help us fight our infectious diseases?” That was the idea before the COVID-19 pandemic. We practiced first on influenza, seasonal flu…. We adapted a type of CRISPR system that targets a specific RNA molecule, and it works pretty well. I remember it working in January [2020] when the news started reporting, “Oh, there’s a new virus, it’s an RNA virus,” and we thought immediately, “What if we use this tool on this new RNA virus?”</p>



<p>Instead [of using the live virus], we used synthetic biology to mimic the RNA sequence.… [And we found] we can still very rapidly cleave and destroy this RNA virus and its fragments in the human lung cells. We were really excited. Since then we’ve been working very hard to follow up on the idea, to make this as fast as possible into a possible antiviral. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32353252/">We called it PAC-MAN</a>.</p>



<h5>Can you talk a bit about how the dead Cas, or dCas, approach has been improved and adapted?</h5>



<p>One bigger use is for treating disease like a gene therapy. However, there’s still a number of features that have not been ideal for easy use or testing in clinics.… [For patient care,] people always think about making the system very, very compact and suitable into a nanoparticle or into a viral particle, so we can deliver them with ease into the human body. So that requires <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(21)00648-1">a miniaturization of the CRISPR system</a>. And we actually did some work on that…. They are like two-thirds smaller than what people use.</p>



<p>And second is, many of these natural proteins from bacteria don’t work very well [in human cells].… So we did some protein engineering. Following these efforts, we actually created some highly compact, yet highly efficient dCas systems that can be easily delivered into the human body to turn on or off genes.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced in the last couple of years?</h5>



<p>We are bioengineers and we think our strength is in creating stuff, modifying. Now as we step into the domain of applying these tools to solve real-world problems, the challenge is how to build a bridge between where we are to where we want to go. That usually requires learning a significant amount about a disease, about a new field, and thinking creatively on how to interface two fields. </p>

<h4>Emily Fischer</h4>



<p><strong>Atmospheric chemist</strong><br><strong>Colorado State University</strong></p>



<p>Emily Fischer, featured in 2020, is in the midst of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2020#fischer">one of the most comprehensive analyses of wildfire smoke ever attempted</a>. Since we last chatted with Fischer, her wildfire research and the way she talks about it have become more personal.</p>



<h5>Have you started any projects since 2020?</h5>



<p>We’re looking at the impact of smoke on the visible light range where photosynthesis occurs. There’s smoke blanketing the U.S. in summers now. Regardless of whether it’s at the ground, it’s somewhere in the atmosphere between the sun and the plants on the ground. In the Midwest, for example, over our corn and soybean belt, there’s smoke between a third to half of the days on average in July and August, during peak growing season. What does that mean for crops? How is that changing the light at the surface? If it’s boosting the diffuse fraction of radiation, and not decreasing the total radiation, that’s a boost to productivity.</p>



<h5>Last year, you helped launch a national group called Science Moms. What is that?</h5>



<p>We are a nonpartisan group of scientists who are also mothers. The goal of <a href="https://sciencemoms.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7ag_v-5mGZoCRiGePqLzDycKpz0G8pnlxL-wrFmf7hg_yJbOwhvtwchoCPtcQAvD_BwE">Science Moms</a> is for us to speak directly [via a website, videos and events] on climate change to other mothers in ways that are accurate, digestible and also engaging. While roughly 60 percent of the U.S. population is worried about climate change, like 85 percent of moms are worried about climate change. But they don’t feel comfortable talking about it, or know how to talk to their representatives about it or even talk to their book club about it.</p>



<h5>How have people responded to your outreach efforts?</h5>



<p>I get all sorts of messages: “This is so different than any other climate communication that I’ve ever seen.” We’re trained as scientists to take the emotion out of things, but actually it’s very important for people to understand the feeling of climate change.</p>



<p>Last summer [2020], extreme fires impacted my own home. We had smoke here for multiple months, and my family ran from the Cameron Peak Fire.… For me, there was a shift from “These are the numbers, these are the graphs,” to “Oh, this is what my graphs feel like, this is what this trend feels like.”</p>



<h5>Did your experience fleeing a wildfire shift your perspective around your science?</h5>



<p>I’m the kind of person who studies what I see.… And so I should not have been surprised by that fire. I was out backpacking with my family, and it started one range over and my kids and I ran out, and we made it. So it was OK, but I was not sure it would be OK. When something like that happens to you, you have to respond to it. [Now] I think, when we calculate a change in something going forward, what does that mean? What are all the impacts that that could have?</p>



<p>Also, seeing the incident management teams working together to help people [during the fire] was very inspiring. I would say to my husband, “These teams are beautiful. They are functioning at such a high level under such hard conditions. If we could just harness this level of cooperation toward climate change action, or toward eliminating the pandemic, we [could] do anything.” </p>

<h3 class="alignwide" id="kipping">The search for exomoons continues</h3>

KIPPING</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>David Kipping</h4>



<p><strong>Astronomer</strong><br><strong>Columbia University</strong></p>



<p>After being <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/david-kipping-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featured in 2017</a>, David Kipping and his colleagues formally reported in <em>Science Advances</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-may-have-spotted-first-known-exomoon">the first detection of a potential exomoon</a> — a moon orbiting a planet outside of the solar system. Signs of the Neptune-sized moon were spotted around a Jupiter-sized planet 8,000 light-years from Earth. Kipping has been hunting for more ever since, and has also become a hit on YouTube.</p>



<h5>Have you found any more exomoons?</h5>



<p>Well, I can’t really talk about that. We are close to releasing the results of a new survey of the ensemble of Jupiter-like planets discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Such planets are thought to be the best hunting ground for moons, being far from the gravitational influence of their star and large enough to support potentially massive moons. Unfortunately, the results are still not quite ready.</p>



<h5>How have other scientists reacted?</h5>



<p>The community is naturally skeptical. That was kind of the story of exoplanets. When researchers first discovered a hot Jupiter, no one believed it. It wasn’t until they discovered about 10 of them that people started to say that, actually, maybe these are real. I don’t know how it’s going to go with any exomoon candidate. Maybe what we’ve found is genuinely bogus, but I obviously hope not. We did our due diligence, and we’re very careful with the results.</p>



<p>It’s maybe not surprising that the first ones we find are going to be so large, because after all, they’re going to be the easiest to detect.… Actually, less than 1&nbsp;percent of sunlike stars have hot Jupiters, but they dominated all of the first exoplanet detections just because they were so easy to find. Maybe the same thing will play out here.</p>



<h5>In 2017, you had just launched a YouTube channel called Cool Worlds. How is that outreach going?</h5>



<p>It’s been pretty overwhelming to us, because I’d never expected to get anywhere near the number of people watching who have watched. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRDONE4zng&amp;ab_channel=CoolWorlds">last video [on what’s called the red sky paradox] got 200,000 views</a>, and the one before it got 500,000. I mean, that’s just bonkers. I get e-mails from people, really amazing e-mails, that say how much the channel and the videos mean to them. That’s really incredible.</p>



<p>We have lots of people actually financially supporting us now. We give them special access to the videos and early access to the papers we’re writing. We hang out with some of them once every two months on a livestream and chat about science. It’s starting to be enough that I’m funding students through donations. I have this dream that I do research, it produces cool ideas, I talk about it on my outreach channel, people get excited about it and they support us, which enables me to do more research.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2017?</h5>



<p>I’m still [working to earn] tenure. It’s obviously one of the most stressful periods of your career because you don’t have that safety net yet that some young tenured colleagues enjoy. At the same time, you’re trying to raise a family and make sure you see your kids growing up. You don’t want to be a ghost at home. And so that’s been tricky, but [the pandemic] enabled me to spend a lot more time at home with the family. </p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you think that an only child behaves differently to a kid with siblings? If you do, you’re hardly alone. Stereotypes about only children being spoiled, self-centred &#8220;little emperors&#8221; abound. In 2019, though, research in Germany concluded that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/15/the-stereotype-of-the-narcissistic-only-child-is-widespread-but-its-wrong/">while the idea that only children are more narcissistic is widespread, it&#8217;s wrong</a>. Now a team in China has failed to find any evidence for another of the clichés: that only children are more selfish.</p>



<span id="more-44039"></span>



<p>In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211038190">a paper</a> in <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em>, Xuegang Zheng at Shaanxi Normal University and colleagues first confirm that this particular stereotype indeed exists — among adults who grew up with siblings, at least. (In the paper, the team uses the term &#8220;only children&#8221; and &#8220;non-only children&#8221; to refer to adults without or with siblings.) This group consistently tended to rate &#8220;typical&#8221; only children as being less prosocial (or more selfish) than non-only children; however, the only children in this study rated both groups the same. The team used various scales to gather these ratings, including a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game">dictator game</a>, in which the participants were asked to judge how much of a given amount of money a &#8220;typical&#8221; only child or non-only child would be willing to share with them. </p>



<p>In a second study of 391 adults (169 of whom were only children), the researchers used the same altruism scales (including the dictator game), but this time asked the participants to rate themselves. They found no differences between the two groups; only children did not emerge as being any more selfish than children with siblings.</p>



<p>This particular stereotype is thought to stem, at least in part, from the idea that only children grow up as the sole focus of their parents’ attention. If this is the case, there may be upsides. Some earlier work has found, for example, that only children tend to report better, warmer relationships with their parents. Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, only children might be <em>more </em>altruistic (or less selfish) towards the people closest to them. So they investigated this idea in a third study.</p>



<p>A group of 99 Chinese students (about half were only children) first identified people at varying social distances from them — from parents, through friends and acquaintances, to strangers. Across a series of trials, each participant was offered a small sum of money and asked whether they wanted to keep it for themselves or share it with a given target person on their social distance scale. (The social distance between the participant and this target person varied across the trials, and the researchers did actually pay out a small proportion of the offered money.)</p>



<p>If the only children were actually <em>more</em> selfless than non-only children with the people closest to them — or perhaps more selfish than non-only children with people they knew less well — this should have been evident in the data. But it wasn’t. Again, there were no differences in the results for the two groups. Though the finding of equal results for only children and non-only children in the second study came only from self-report data, these findings on actual behaviour shore up&nbsp; the conclusion that the stereotype is wrong.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the sample sizes in these studies were small. And the results might not be generalisable beyond China (where of course the one-child policy has had a big impact), or even across China (as the samples were not nationally representative). Also, these studies were all on adults who had grown up with or without siblings, rather than only <em>children</em>. Still, the results do add to the growing evidence against common stereotypes about only children — or &#8220;only adults&#8221;, at least.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-ground-sloths-meat-scavenger-paleontology">Giant ground sloths may have been meat-eating scavengers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern sloths may be dedicated vegetarians, but at least one of their massive Ice Age cousins chowed down on meat when it had the chance. &nbsp;Darwin’s ground sloth — which could grow to over 3 meters long and weigh as much as about 2,000 kilograms — may have been an opportunistic scavenger, chemical analyses of fossil sloth hair suggest.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Julia Tejada of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues analyzed the chemical makeup of two amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, within the fossil hair of two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-prove-humans-hunted-giant-sloths-during-ice-age">giant ground sloth species</a>: Darwin’s ground sloth (<em>Mylodon darwinii</em>) of South America and the Shasta ground sloth (<em>Nothrotheriops shastensis</em>) of North America (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). The team compared these with samples from living sloths, anteaters and other modern omnivores.</p>





<p>Nitrogen isotopes, different forms of the element, can vary a lot among different food sources as well as between ecosystems. Those isotope values in one amino acid, glutamine, change significantly with diet, increasing the higher the animal is on the food chain. But diet has little impact on the nitrogen values in another amino acid, phenylalamine. By comparing the nitrogen isotopes in the two amino acids found in the sloths’ hair, the researchers were able to eliminate ecosystem effects and zoom in on diets.</p>





<p>The data reveal that while the diet of the Shasta ground slothwas exclusively plant-based, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97996-9">Darwin’s ground sloth was an omnivore</a>, Tejada and colleagues report October 7 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The findings upend what scientists thought they knew about the ancient animals. Scientists have assumed the ancient creatures were herbivores. That’s in part because all six modern species of sloth are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/three-toed-sloths-are-even-more-slothful-two-toed-sloths">confirmed vegetarians</a>, and in part giant ground sloths’ teeth and jaws weren’t adapted for hunting or powerful chewing and tearing (<em>SN: 6/20/16</em>).</p>



<p>But Darwin’s ground sloth could have managed to ingest already-killed meat, Tejada and colleagues say. And that might help solve a long-standing puzzle: the apparent absence of large carnivorous mammals in South America at the time. Darwin’s ground sloth, the researchers add, may have filled a vacant ecological niche: the scavenger who wouldn’t say no to a meaty meal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-2021-molecule-build-tool-list-macmillan">An easier, greener way to build molecules wins the chemistry Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making molecules is hard work. Atoms must be stitched together into specific arrangements through a series of chemical reactions that are often slow, convoluted and wasteful. The 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry recognizes two scientists who developed a tool at the turn of the century that revolutionized how chemists construct new molecules, making the process faster and more environmentally friendly.</p>



<p>Chemists Benjamin List of the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany and David MacMillan of Princeton University were awarded the prize for independently developing organic catalysts that speed up chemical reactions necessary for constructing specific molecules, a process called asymmetric organocatalysis. The two will share the prize of 10 million Swedish kroner (more than $1.1 million), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 6 in a news conference in Stockholm.</p>



<p>“This is a fitting recognition of very important work,” says H.N. Cheng, president of the American Chemical Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can think of chemists as magicians having magic wands in the lab,” Cheng says. “We wave the wand and a reaction goes on.” These Nobel laureates gave chemists “a new wand,” that’s drastically more efficient and less wasteful, he says.</p>





<p>Making new drugs or designing novel materials often requires building new molecules from simpler chemical building blocks. But these chemical building blocks can’t just be thrown together. Instead, they must be carefully combined in precise arrangements through a series of chemical reactions. Many chemical reactions produce two versions of a molecule that are mirror images of one another, and often those two versions can have very different effects. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/return-thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, a drug prescribed in the 1950s and ‘60s for morning sickness, caused birth defects in more than 10,000 babies because of one mirror image of this molecule (<em>SN: 12/24/94</em>). Consequently, building these asymmetric molecules and controlling which version of a molecule gets produced is extremely important, especially for drug development.</p>





<p>Chemical reactions can be coaxed along by catalysts — molecular workhorses that accelerate chemical reactions without being transformed by them. Historically, chemists have known about two kinds of catalysts: enzymes and metal complexes. Enzymes are big, clunky proteins that have been honed by evolution to perform very specific chemical actions in the body, but they can be difficult to use on a large scale in the lab. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-greener-catalysts-are-built-speed">Metals, such as platinum or cobalt, can kick-start some reactions too</a>, but many only work in airless, waterless environments that are difficult to achieve in manufacturing contexts (<em>SN: 2/21/17</em>). Additionally, many metal catalysts are also toxic to the environment and expensive to procure.</p>



<p>For much of the history of chemistry, these were the only tools available to chemists who wanted to make new molecules. “But in the year 2000, everything changed,” Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, a chemist at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin List, then at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., was studying the aldol reaction, which links two molecules together through carbon bonds. In organisms, such reactions are crucial for converting food into energy, and depend on a large and complex enzyme called aldolase A. Only a small part of the enzyme actually catalyzes the reaction, however, and List discovered that a single amino acid — proline — could do the work of this big clunky protein while also producing one version of the final product much more often than the other.</p>

<p>“When I did this experiment, I didn’t know what would happen and I thought maybe it’s a stupid idea,” List said during the news conference. “When I saw it work, I did feel it could be something big.”</p>



<p>Unbeknown to List, MacMillan was also looking for alternative organic catalysts around the same time. MacMillan, then at the University of California, Berkeley, focused on another chemical reaction, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/diels-alder-reaction-gains-nobel-prize">Diels-Alder reaction</a>, which forms rings of carbon atoms (<em>SN: 11/18/50</em>). It’s an important reaction, used today to make products as different as rubber and pharmaceuticals, but was very slow and relied on finicky metal catalysts that wouldn’t work when wet. MacMillan designed small organic molecules that mimicked the catalytic action of metals in a simpler way, while also favoring the production of one of two possible mirror images of the final product. He coined this new kind of catalysis “asymmetric organocatalysis<em>.”</em></p>

<p>List’s and MacMillan’s discoveries set off an explosion of research into finding more organocatalysts over the next two decades, work that’s aided drug discovery among other uses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 35 percent of the world’s gross domestic product depends on catalysis, Peter Somfai, a chemist at Lund University in Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference. “We now have a new powerful tool available for making organic molecules,” one that can be drastically more efficient and greener than previous methods.</p>



<p>Somfai highlighted this leap forward in efficiency using the neurotoxin strychnine. The molecule itself isn’t useful for chemists, but its complicated structure makes it a good benchmark for comparing different synthesis methodologies. Previously, chemists relied on an extremely wasteful process of 29 different reactions where just 0.0009 percent of the initial material became strychnine. Using organocatalysis, strychnine can now be synthesized in just 12 steps, and the whole process is 7,000 times more efficient, Somfai said. And because this extra efficiency is gained without using toxic metals, organocatalysis is a more environmentally friendly way of synthesizing chemicals.</p>



<p>If building new molecules is like playing chess, organocatalysis has “completely changed the game,” Somfai said. “It’s like adding a new chess piece that can move in different ways.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">When James Webb launches, it will have a bigger to-do list than 1980s researchers suspected</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The James Webb Space Telescope has been a long time coming. When it launches later this year, the observatory will be the largest and most complex telescope ever sent into orbit. Scientists have been drafting and redrafting their dreams and plans for this unique tool since 1989.</p>



<p>The mission was originally scheduled to launch between 2007 and 2011, but a series of budget and technical issues pushed its start date back more than a decade. Remarkably, the core design of the telescope hasn’t changed much. But the science that it can dig into has. In the years of waiting for Webb to be ready, big scientific questions have emerged. When Webb was an early glimmer in astronomers’ eyes, cosmological revolutions like the discoveries of dark energy and planets orbiting stars outside our solar system hadn’t yet happened.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/about-jwst/history">It’s been over 25 years</a>,” says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. “But I think it was really worth the wait.”</p>



<h4>An audacious plan<br></h4>





<p>Webb has a distinctive design. Most space telescopes house a single lens or mirror within a tube that blocks sunlight from swamping the dim lights of the cosmos. But Webb’s massive 6.5-meter-wide mirror and its scientific instruments are exposed to the vacuum of space. A multilayered shield the size of a tennis court will block light from the sun, Earth and moon.</p>



<p>For the awkward shape to fit on a rocket, Webb will launch folded up, then unfurl itself in space (see below, What could go wrong?).</p>



<p>“They call this the origami satellite,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute, or STScI, in Baltimore. Friedman is in charge of Webb’s postlaunch choreography. “Webb is different from any other telescope that’s flown.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A novel design</h3>



<p>Once all is unfolded, the James Webb Space Telescope’s sun shield will span the length of a tennis court to protect the main and secondary mirrors from the sun, moon and Earth’s light and heat. The solar panels, exposed to the sun, will convert light to electricity to power the instruments. Webb’s antenna will keep it communicating with scientists on Earth, sending data from the scientific instruments. The stabilization flap keeps the machine from veering off course.</p>

</div>



<p>Its basic design hasn’t changed in more than 25 years. The telescope was first proposed in September 1989 at a workshop held at STScI, which also runs the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>At the time, Hubble was less than a year from launching, and was expected to function for only 15 years. Thirty-one years after its launch, the telescope is still going strong, despite a series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-new-trouble-probably-wont-doom-space-telescope">computer glitches and gyroscope failures</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>The institute director at the time, Riccardo Giacconi, was concerned that the next major mission would take longer than 15 years to get off the ground. So he and others proposed that <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA investigate a possible successor to Hubble</a>: a space telescope with a 10-meter-wide primary mirror that was sensitive to light in infrared wavelengths to complement Hubble’s range of ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared.</p>



<p>Infrared light has a longer wavelength than light that is visible to human eyes. But it’s perfect for a telescope to look back in time. Because light travels at a fixed speed, looking at distant objects in the universe means seeing them as they looked in the past. The universe is expanding, so that light is stretched before it reaches our telescopes. For the most distant objects in the universe — the first galaxies to clump together, or the first stars to burn in those galaxies — light that was originally emitted in shorter wavelengths is stretched all the way to the infrared.</p>



<p>Giacconi and his collaborators dreamed of a telescope that would detect that stretched light from the earliest galaxies. When Hubble started sharing its views of the early universe, the dream solidified into a science plan. The galaxies Hubble saw at great distances “looked different from what people were expecting,” says astronomer Massimo Stiavelli, a leader of the James Webb Space Telescope project who has been at STScI since 1995. “People started thinking that there is interesting science here.”</p>



<p>In 1995, STScI and NASA commissioned a report to design Hubble’s successor. The report, led by astronomer Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., suggested an infrared space observatory with a 4-meter-wide mirror.</p>



<p>The bigger a telescope’s mirror, the more light it can collect, and the farther it can see. Four meters wasn’t that much larger than Hubble’s 2.4-meter-wide mirror, but anything bigger would be difficult to launch.</p>



<p>Dressler briefed then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin in late 1995. In January 1996 at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting, Goldin challenged the scientists to be more ambitious. He called out Dressler by name, saying, “Why do you ask for such a modest thing? Why not go after six or seven meters?” (Still nowhere near Giacconi’s pie-in-the-sky 10-meter wish.) The speech received a standing ovation.</p>



<p>Six meters was a larger mirror than had ever flown in space, and larger than would fit in available launch vehicles. Scientists would have to design a telescope mirror that could fold, then deploy once it reached space.</p>



<p>The telescope would also need to cool itself passively by radiating heat into space. It needed a sun shield — a big one. The origami telescope was born. It was dubbed James Webb in 2002 for NASA’s administrator from 1961 to 1968, who fought to support research to boost understanding of the universe in the increasingly human-focused space program. (In response to a May petition to change the name, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1">NASA investigated allegations</a> that James Webb persecuted gay and lesbian people during his government career. The agency announced on September 27 that it found no evidence warranting a name change.)</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Mixed views</h3>



<p>Webb will observe the universe in wavelengths that are mostly longer than what humans can see (0.38 to 0.7 micrometers) and what the Hubble Space Telescope can observe, yet shorter than most of the Spitzer Space Telescope’s range. This infrared view lets telescopes observe farther and see through dust clouds.</p>

<p>Goldin’s motto at NASA was “Faster, better, cheaper.” Bigger was better for Webb, but it sure wasn’t faster — or cheaper. By late 2010, the project <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cost-overruns-and-delays-add-65-billion-nasas-next-gen-space-telescope">was more than $1.4 billion over its $5.1 billion budget</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/11, p. 22</em>). And it was going to take another five years to be ready. Today, the cost is estimated at almost $10 billion.</p>



<p>The telescope survived a near-cancellation by Congress, and its timeline was reset for an October 2018 launch. But in 2017, the launch was pushed to June 2019. Two more delays in 2018 pushed the takeoff to May 2020, then to March 2021. Some of those delays were because assembling and testing the spacecraft took longer than NASA expected.</p>



<p>Other slowdowns were because of human errors, like using the wrong cleaning solvent, which damaged valves in the propulsion system. Recent shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic pushed the launch back a few more months.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we ever imagined it would be this long,” says University of Chicago’s Freedman, who worked on the Dressler report. But there’s one silver lining: Science marched on.</p>



<h4>The age conflict</h4>



<p>The first science goal <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci/org/hst-and-beyond-report.pdf">listed in the Dressler report</a> was “the detailed study of the birth and evolution of normal galaxies such as the Milky Way.” That is still the dream, partly because it’s such an ambitious goal, Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>“We wanted a science rationale that would resist the test of time,” he says. “We didn’t want to build a mission that would do something that gets done in some other way before you’re done.”</p>



<p>Webb will peek at galaxies and stars as they were just 400 million years after the Big Bang, which astronomers think is the epoch when the first tiny galaxies began making the universe transparent to light by stripping electrons from cosmic hydrogen.</p>



<p>But in the 1990s, astronomers had a problem: There didn’t seem to be enough time in the universe to make galaxies much earlier than the ones astronomers had already seen. The standard cosmology at the time suggested the universe was 8 billion or 9 billion years old, but there were stars in the Milky Way that seemed to be about 14 billion years old.</p>



<p>“There was this age conflict that reared its head,” Freedman says. “You can’t have a universe that’s younger than the oldest stars. The way people put it was, ‘You can’t be older than your grandmother!’”</p>

<h3>Getting there</h3>



<p>Webb will orbit the sun from a stable point in space called L2, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The telescope will spend its first month after launch getting to this point and unfolding its sun shield and mirrors. The sun shield will face Earth and the sun at all times, keeping their light and heat away from the telescope’s sensitive instruments. Once at L2, the telescope will spend another five months turning on and testing its scientific instruments before collecting data.</p>

<p>In 1998, two teams of cosmologists showed that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. A mysterious substance dubbed dark energy may be pushing the universe to expand faster and faster. That accelerated expansion means the universe is older than astronomers previously thought — the current estimate is about 13.8 billion years old.</p>



<p>“That resolved the age conflict,” Freedman says. “The discovery of dark energy changed everything.” And it expanded Webb’s to-do list.</p>



<h4>Dark energy</h4>



<p>Top of the list is getting to the bottom of a mismatch in cosmic measurements. Since at least 2014, different methods for measuring the universe’s rate of expansion — called the Hubble constant — have been giving different answers. Freedman calls the issue “the most important problem in cosmology today.”</p>



<p>The question, Freedman says, is whether the mismatch is real. A real mismatch could indicate something profound about the nature of dark energy and the history of the universe. But the discrepancy could just be due to measurement errors.</p>



<p>Webb can help settle the debate. One common way to determine the Hubble constant is by measuring the distances and speeds of far-off galaxies. Measuring cosmic distances is difficult, but astronomers can estimate them using objects of known brightness, called standard candles. If you know the object’s actual brightness, you can calculate its distance based on how bright it seems from Earth.</p>



<p>Studies using supernovas and variable stars called Cepheids as candles have found an expansion rate of 74.0 kilometers per second for approximately every 3 million light-years, or megaparsec, of distance between objects. But using red giant stars, Freedman and colleagues have gotten a smaller answer: 69.8 km/s/Mpc.</p>



<p>Other studies have measured the Hubble constant by looking at the dim glow of light emitted just 380,000 years after the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background. Calculations based on that glow give a smaller rate still: 67.4 km/s/Mpc. Although these numbers may seem close, the fact that they disagree at all could alter our understanding of the contents of the universe and how it evolves over time. The discrepancy has been called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">crisis in cosmology</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go">In its first year, Webb will observe</a> some of the same galaxies used in the supernova studies, using three different objects as candles: Cepheids, red giants and peculiar stars called carbon stars.</p>



<p>The telescope will also try to measure the Hubble constant using a distant gravitationally lensed galaxy. Comparing those measurements with each other and with similar ones from Hubble will show if earlier measurements were just wrong, or if the tension between measurements is real, Freedman says.</p>



<p>Without these new observations, “we were just going to argue about the same things forever,” she says. “We just need better data. And [Webb] is poised to deliver it.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>What could go wrong?</h3>



<p>For the James Webb Space Telescope, getting into space is just step one. The telescope must complete a complicated series of unfolding steps before it can observe the cosmos. The entire sequence, including getting the science instruments ready, will take about six months.</p>



<p>“A lot has to go right, that’s for sure,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who is in charge of this timeline. Webb will be heading to a point in space called L2, which is too far from Earth for astronauts to visit and make repairs. “There’s every reason to believe things will go very well,” Friedman says. “But we won’t know until we get there.”</p>

</div><figcaption><br>Here’s a timeline of what has to go right (all times are approximate).</figcaption></figure>
</div>



<h4>Exoplanets</h4>



<p>Perhaps the biggest change for Webb science has been the rise of the field of exoplanet explorations.</p>



<p>“When this was proposed, exoplanets were scarcely a thing,” says STScI’s Friedman. “And now, of course, it’s one of the hottest topics in all of science, especially all of astronomy.”</p>



<p>The Dressler report’s second major goal for Hubble’s successor was “the detection of Earthlike planets around other stars and the search for evidence of life on them.” But back in 1995, only a handful of planets orbiting other sunlike stars were even known, and all of them were scorching-hot gas giants — nothing like Earth at all.</p>



<p>Since then, astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. Scientists now estimate that, on average, there is at least one planet for every star we see in the sky. And some of the planets are small and rocky, with the right temperatures to support liquid water, and maybe life.</p>



<p>Most of the known planets were discovered as they crossed, or transited, in front of their parent stars, blocking a little bit of the parent star’s light. Astronomers soon realized that, if those planets have atmospheres, a sensitive telescope could effectively sniff the air by examining the starlight that filters through the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003, and Hubble have started this work. But Spitzer ran out of coolant in 2009, keeping it too warm to measure important molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. And Hubble is not sensitive to some of the most interesting wavelengths of light — the ones that could reveal alien life-forms.</p>



<p>That’s where Webb is going to shine. If Hubble is peeking through a crack in a door, Webb will throw the door wide open, says exoplanet scientist Nikole Lewis of Cornell University. Crucially, Webb, unlike Hubble, will be particularly sensitive to several carbon-bearing molecules in exoplanet atmospheres that might be signs of life.</p>



<p>“Hubble can’t tell us anything really about carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane,” she says.</p>



<p>If Webb had launched in 2007, it could have missed this whole field. Even though the first transiting exoplanet was discovered in 1999, their numbers were low for the next decade.</p>



<p>Lewis remembers thinking, when she started grad school in 2007, that she could make a computer model of all the transiting exoplanets. “Because there were literally only 25,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Transit advantages</h3>



<p>Webb will measure the composition of exoplanet atmospheres by looking at the light from the planet’s host star as the planet crosses in front of the star. Atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K), absorb certain wavelengths of the starlight, leaving a unique fingerprint in the spectrum of light that reaches Webb’s detectors.</p>

</div>



<p>Between 2009 and 2018, NASA’s Kepler space telescope raked in transiting planets by the thousands. But those planets were too dim and distant for Webb to probe their atmospheres.</p>



<p>So the down-to-the-wire delays of the last few years have actually been good for exoplanet research, Lewis says. “The launch delays were one of the best things that’s happened for exoplanet science with Webb,” she says. “Full stop.”</p>



<p>That’s mainly thanks to NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/">or TESS</a>, which launched in April 2018. TESS’ job is to find planets orbiting the brightest, nearest stars, which will give Webb the best shot at detecting interesting molecules in planetary atmospheres.</p>



<p>If it had launched in 2018, Webb would have had to wait a few years for TESS to pick out the best targets. Now, it can get started on those worlds right away. Webb’s first year of observations will include probing several known exoplanets that have been hailed as possible places to find life. Scientists will survey planets orbiting small, cool stars called M dwarfs to make sure such planets even have atmospheres, a question that has been hotly debated.</p>



<p>If a sign of life does show up on any of these planets, that result will be fiercely debated, too, Lewis says. “There will be a huge kerfuffle in the literature when that comes up.” It will be hard to compare planets orbiting M dwarfs with Earth, because these planets and their stars are so different from ours. Still, “let’s look and see what we find,” she says.</p>



<h4>A limited lifetime</h4>



<p>With its components assembled, tested and folded at Northrop Grumman’s facilities in California, Webb is on its way by boat through the Panama Canal, ready to launch in an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. The most recent launch date is set for December 18.</p>



<p>For the scientists who have been working on Webb for decades, this is a nostalgic moment.</p>



<p>“You start to relate to the folks who built the pyramids,” Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>Other scientists, who grew up in a world where Webb was always on the horizon, are already thinking about the next big thing.</p>



<p>“I’m pretty sure, barring epic disaster, that [Webb] will carry my career through the next decade,” Lewis says. “But I have to think about what I’ll do in the<em> next</em> decade” after that.<br><br>Unlike Hubble, which has lasted decades thanks to fixes by astronauts and upgrade missions, Webb has a strictly limited lifetime. Orbiting the sun at a gravitationally fixed point called L2, Webb will be too far from Earth to repair, and will need to burn small amounts of fuel to stay in position. The fuel will last for at least five years, and hopefully as much as 10. But when the fuel runs out, Webb is finished. The telescope operators will move it into retirement in an out-of-the-way orbit around the sun, and bid it farewell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-venus-collision-planet-formation">Space rocks may have bounced off baby Earth, but slammed into Venus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Squabbling sibling planets may have hurled space rocks when they were young.</p>



<p>Simulations suggest that space rocks the size of baby planets struck both the newborn Earth and Venus, but many of the rocks that only grazed Earth went on to hit — and stick — to Venus. That difference in early impacts could help explain <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac19b1#fnref-psjac19b1bib8">why Earth and Venus are such different worlds today</a>, researchers report September 23 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“The pronounced differences between Earth and Venus, in spite of their similar orbits and masses, has been one of the biggest puzzles in our solar system,” says planetary scientist Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new work. This study introduces “a new point that has not been raised before.”</p>



<p>Scientists have typically thought that there are two ways that collisions between baby planets can go. The objects could graze each other and each continue on its way, in a hit-and-run collision. Or two protoplanets could stick together, or accrete, making one larger planet. Planetary scientists often assume that every hit-and-run collision eventually leads to accretion. Objects that collide must have orbits that cross each other’s, so they’re bound to collide again and again, and eventually should stick.</p>





<p>But previous work from planetary scientist Erik Asphaug of the University of Arizona in Tucson and others suggests that isn’t so. It takes special conditions for two planets to merge, Asphaug says, like relatively slow impact speeds, so hit-and-runs were probably much more common in the young solar system.</p>



<p>Asphaug and colleagues wondered what that might have meant for Earth and Venus, two apparently similar planets with vastly different climates. Both worlds are about the same size and mass, but Earth is wet and clement while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">Venus is a searing, acidic hellscape</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>“If they started out on similar pathways, somehow Venus took a wrong turn,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>The team ran about 4,000 computer simulations in which Mars-sized protoplanets crashed into a young Earth or Venus, assuming the two planets were at their current distances from the sun. The researchers found that about half of the time, incoming protoplanets grazed Earth without directly colliding. Of those, about half went on to collide with Venus.</p>



<p>Unlike Earth, Venus ended up accreting most of the objects that hit it in the simulations. Hitting Earth first slowed incoming objects down enough to let them stick to Venus later, the study suggests. “You have this imbalance where things that hit the Earth, but don’t stick, tend to end up on Venus,” Asphaug says. “We have a fundamental explanation for why Venus ended up accreting differently from the Earth.”</p>



<p>If that’s really what happened, it would have had a significant effect on the composition of the two worlds. Earth would have ended up with more of the outer mantle and crust material from the incoming protoplanets, while Venus would have gotten more of their iron-rich cores.</p>



<p>The imbalance in impacts could even explain some major Venusian mysteries, like why the planet doesn’t have a moon, why it spins so slowly and why it lacks a magnetic field — though “these are hand-waving kind of conjectures,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>Ida says he hopes that future work will look into those questions more deeply. “I’m looking forward to follow-up studies to examine if the new result actually explains the Earth-Venus difference,” he says.</p>



<p>The idea fits into a growing debate among planetary scientists about how the solar system grew up, says planetary scientist Seth Jacobson of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Was it built violently, with lots of giant collisions, or calmly, with planets growing smoothly via pebbles sticking together?</p>



<p>“This paper falls on the end of lots of giant impacts,” Jacobson says.</p>



<p>Each rocky planet in the solar system should have very different chemistry and structure depending on which scenario is true. But scientists know the chemistry and structure of only one planet with any confidence: Earth. And Earth’s early history has been overwritten by plate tectonics and other geologic activity. “Venus is the missing link,” Jacobson says. “Learning more about Venus’ chemistry and interior structure is going to tell us more about whether it had a giant impact or not.”</p>



<p>Three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">missions to Venus</a> are expected to launch in the late 2020s and 2030s (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). Those should help, but none are expected to take the kind of detailed composition measurements that could definitively solve the mystery. That would take a long-lived lander, or a sample return mission, both of which would be extremely difficult on hot, hostile Venus.</p>



<p>“I wish there was an easier way to test it,” Jacobson says. “I think that’s where we should concentrate our energy as terrestrial planet formation scientists going forward.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/06/language-proficiency-can-determine-how-similarly-first-and-second-languages-are-represented-in-the-brain/">Language Proficiency Can Determine How Similarly First And Second Languages Are Represented In The Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Researchers widely agree that first and second languages are handled similarly in the brain. According to previous research, proficient bilinguals’ brain activity is broadly quite similar when accessing their first and second languages.</p>



<p>However, the literature exploring this until now has relied on imaging methods that can tell us <em>where</em> in the brain there is activity, but not <em>how</em> languages are represented in those areas. Distinct patterns of activation may have differentiated first and second languages in those same regions all this time, and by relying on traditional forms of imaging analysis alone, we could have been none the wiser.</p>



<p>Thanks to new imaging methods, however, we’re finally able to take a look at activation in these areas in a much more detailed way. Now, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25633?af=R">newly published work</a> from Emily Nichols at The University of Western Ontario and colleagues suggests that languages are represented more distinctly than we thought.</p>



<span id="more-44021"></span>



<p>For this study, the researchers gathered a sample of 32 bilingual English and Mandarin speakers living in Beijing. All participants spoke English as their first language, and Mandarin as their second. As might be expected, the age of acquisition (AoA) and proficiency of Mandarin — as measured by self-report and pre-testing, respectively — varied from person to person.</p>



<p>During their fMRI scans, participants were presented with a picture-word matching task in both English and Mandarin. For each trial of this task, they were shown a picture for 2.5 seconds, while an audio clip of a common two-syllable word, which either matched or didn’t match the image shown, was played. These audio clips alternated between English and Mandarin for all 160 trials, and participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible via button press whether or not the audio given matched the contents of the image.</p>



<p>The team then used a technique known as representational similarity analysis (RSA) on imaging data collected during correct trials, in order to see which brain areas reliably showed different patterns of activation between languages. This fMRI technique is relatively new, and can reveal differences in similar activation patterns which were previously unmeasurable. For example, a previous study looking at reading in bilingual individuals used RSA to show distinct activation patterns in regions which handle visual word recognition when participants read text in each language. Here, the team hoped to apply this same method to probe brain activity during auditory, rather than visual, word recognition.</p>



<p>As expected, both English and Mandarin produced activity in an extensive network of language-related regions. When the team looked within those regions that were active for both languages, there were no overall significant differences in activation depending on language. However, the story changed when the team looked in more detail at the effects of AoA and proficiency on the levels of activation.</p>



<p>These analyses revealed that there were differences in how the two languages were represented, which could be predicted by AoA and proficiency. For example, people with a wider difference in first and second language proficiency showed more dissimilar patterns of activation in areas such as the left inferior fusiform gyrus and bilateral supramarginal gyrus, which are involved in articulation and auditory-motor integration, respectively. The more similar the proficiency between the two languages, the more similar the activation pattern. Likewise, the older the AoA, the more distinct the patterns of activation between first and second languages were.</p>



<p>In addition, results showed several areas that were more active in those with younger AoAs — the right insula, the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and the area prostriata of the calcarine sulcus. However, the relationship between these regions and bilingual auditory word recognition is less clear. It’s likely that differences in activation in these areas, at least in part, represent differences in the ability to inhibit other language responses. But, further research is needed to disentangle exactly what these differences mean, and how they relate to AoA.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there was also a distinct dissimilarity between participants with lower second language proficiency and those who acquired their second language later in ventral visual areas, which handle object recognition and concept representation. This, the authors suggest, is indicative that language can likely affect our perceptions of what we’re looking at. This idea isn’t totally unheard of, either — <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00054/full">previous research</a> outlining the label-feedback hypothesis also highlighted that variations in language can alter our ability to categorise, discriminate between, and even detect objects.</p>



<p>These findings not only support the current model of an integrated language system in bilinguals, but they extend our understanding of how individual differences dictate language representations within the brain. Future research to verify that these patterns are consistent across languages, or whether they vary by language similarity, are likely to give us a greater understanding of whether these results are in part due to the large differences between English and Mandarin. Research using RSA which looks into the effect grammar may have on differences in brain activation is also a topic for investigation. As it stands, this study represents a new and exciting approach for disentangling finer differences in how the brain represents and utilises first and second languages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physics-2021-complex-systems-climate">Work on complex systems, including Earth’s climate, wins the physics Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s climate is a vastly complex system on a grand scale. On a microscopic level, so is the complicated physics of atoms and molecules found within materials. The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics knits together the work of three scientists who illuminated such intricate physical systems by harnessing basic tools of physics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of the prize goes to climate scientists Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, for their work on simulations of Earth’s climate and predictions of global warming, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 5. The other half of the 10 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.1 million) prize goes to physicist Giorgio Parisi of Sapienza University of Rome, who worked on understanding the roiling fluctuations within disordered materials.</p>



<p>All three researchers used a similar strategy of isolating a specific piece of a complex system in a model, a mathematical representation of something found in nature. By studying that model, and then integrating that understanding into more complicated descriptions, the researchers made progress on understanding otherwise perplexing systems, says physicist Brad Marston of Brown University. “There’s an art to constructing a model that is rich enough to give you interesting and perhaps surprising results, but simple enough that you can hope to understand it.”</p>





<p>The prize, normally an apolitical affair, sends a message to world leaders: “The notion of global warming is resting on solid science,” said Göran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, during the announcement of the prize winners. Human emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, have increased Earth’s average temperature by more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times. That warming is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">affecting every region on Earth</a>, exacerbating extreme weather events such as heat waves, wildfires and drought (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="340" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3104316" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104316">Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University (left) and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (right) worked on early simulations of Earth’s climate, laying the foundation for today’s more detailed climate models that are used to grapple with the potential impacts of global warming.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104316">From left: Bengt Nyman/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0); Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Manabe’s work laid the foundation for climate modeling, said John Wettlaufer of Yale University, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics. “He really did construct the models from which all future climate models were built,” Wettlaufer explained during an interview after the prize announcement. “That scaffolding is essential for the improvement of predictions of climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manabe studied how rising carbon dioxide levels would change temperatures on Earth. A <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/24/3/1520-0469_1967_024_0241_teotaw_2_0_co_2.xml">simplified climate model</a> from a 1967 paper coauthored by Manabe simulated a single column of the atmosphere in which air masses rise and fall as they warm and cool, which revealed that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased the temperature by over 2 degrees C. This understanding could then be integrated into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/computing-link-between-sea-and-air">more complex models</a> that simulated the entire atmosphere or included the effects of the oceans, for example (<em>SN: 5/30/70</em>). </p>





<p>“I never imagined that this thing I would begin to study had such huge consequences,” Manabe said at a news conference at Princeton. “I was doing it just because of my curiosity.”</p>



<p>Hasselmann studied the evolution of Earth’s climate while taking into account the variety of timescales over which different processes operate. The randomness of daily weather stands in contrast to seasonal variations and much slower processes like gradual heating of the Earth’s oceans. Hassleman’s work helped to show how the short-term jitter could be incorporated into models to understand the long-term change in climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prize is an affirmation of scientists’ understanding of climate, says Michael Moloney, CEO of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Md. “The climate models which we depend on in order to understand the impact of the climate crisis are world-class science up there with all the other great discoveries that are recognized [by] Nobel Prizes of years past.”</p>

<p>Much like the weather patterns on Earth, the inner world of atoms within materials can be complex and disorderly. Parisi’s work took aim at understanding the processes within disordered systems such as a type of material called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changes-mathematical-state">spin glass</a> (<em>SN: 10/18/02</em>). In spin glasses, atoms behave like small magnets, due to a quantum property called spin. But the atoms can’t agree on which direction to point their magnets, resulting in a disordered arrangement. </p>



<p>That’s similar to more familiar types of glass — a material in which atoms don’t reach an orderly arrangement. Parisi came up with a mathematical description for such spin glasses. His work also touches on a variety of other complex topics, from turbulence to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-turns-match-math-quantum-matter">flocking patterns</a> that describe the motions of animals such as starlings (<em>SN: 7/31/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although his work doesn’t directly focus on climate, in an interview during the Nobel announcement, Parisi commented on that half of the prize: “It’s clear that for the future generation we have to act now in a very fast way.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radiometric-dating-history-carbon-century-science">Radiometric dating puts pieces of the past in context. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a researcher picks up an object — whether it’s a scrap of leather from a dig site, a fossil from a museum drawer or a newly fallen meteorite — their first question might be, “What is this thing?” A natural follow-up: “How old is it?” The first question is fundamental, no doubt. But the second is powerful, too. It helps place the object in its proper archaeological, geologic or cosmological context. “Without knowing the ages of things, there is no narrative,” says Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Up until a century or so ago, researchers studying rocks and the fossils they contain could answer the age question only vaguely if at all. Using guidelines established by geologists in the 1600s, they could gauge a rock’s age only in relative terms: For example, Sample A was considered older than Sample B if it came from a lower and presumed older layer of sediment or rock. But Earth is a dynamic place. Missing layers, as well as disturbances from earthquakes, landslides or other upheavals, meant even relative ages for rocks could be difficult to determine. Ditto for the bones, tools and other artifacts within the earth: Previous excavations, or even the day-to-day activities of a site’s ancient residents, could churn the soil and thus disrupt the layers.</p>

<p>The discovery of radioactivity in the mid-1890s paved the way for scientists to ascertain the absolute ages of some objects, says Doug Macdougall, a geochemist formerly at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the author of <em>Nature’s Clocks</em>. Within less than a decade, he notes, several physicists had proposed methods for doing so. The methods are based on the finding that each type, or isotope, of a radioactive atom has its own particular half-life — the time that it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay. Because radioactive decay occurs in the nucleus of the atom, half-life doesn’t change with environmental conditions, from the hellish heat and crushing pressures deep inside Earth to the frigid realm of the far solar system. That makes radioactive isotopes wonderful clocks.</p>



<p>Today, radiometric dating spans the ages, from recent times to the birth of our solar system. Carbon-14 dating is most suited to something that lived during the last 50,000 years or something made from such organisms — the wooden shafts of arrows, the leather in a moccasin or the plant fibers used to weave fabrics or baskets. Longer-lived isotopes of uranium and thorium can help peer deep into Earth’s past — back to when our planet’s first rocks were forming, or even further, to when our solar system was coalescing from gas and dust.</p>



<p>There are several different methods for estimating ages using half-lives, Macdougall explains. For isotopes with relatively rapid decay rates, researchers determine the proportion of a radioactive isotope relative to other atoms of the same element and compare it with how much of that isotope a fresh sample would be expected to have. With that information, along with the known half-life, it’s possible to estimate the age of the original sample.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="371" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg" alt="composite image of 5,500-year-old shoe, with close-ups on laces and heel" class="wp-image-3103879" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1-330x180.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103879">With radiocarbon dating, this leather shoe, well-preserved in a cave in Armenia, was determined to be 5,500 years old.

<p>This approach works well for carbon-14, possibly one of the most familiar isotopes used in radiometric dating. While a plant or animal is alive, it takes in carbon from the environment. But when the organism dies, that intake stops. Because carbon-14 is created high in Earth’s atmosphere at a fairly constant rate, scientists can readily estimate the amount of that isotope that should be present in a living organism.</p>



<p>Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5,730 years — which means that 5,730 years after an organism dies, half of the isotope present in the original sample will have decayed. After another 5,730 years, half of the carbon-14 that remained has decayed (leaving one-fourth of the amount from the original sample). Eventually, after 50,000 years or so (or almost nine half-lives), so little carbon-14 remains that the sample can’t be reliably dated.</p>



<p>Besides carbon-14, this technique can be used for short-lived isotopes of sulfur, silicon, phosphorus and beryllium, Macdougall says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="457" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2.jpg" alt="portion of Egyptian coffin depicting a human face" class="wp-image-3103880" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-570x383.jpg 570w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-670x450.jpg 670w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-277x186.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103880">Chemist Willard Libby tested this wood from an ancient Egyptian coffin and other artifacts during his development of radiocarbon dating.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103880">Jean Lachat/University of Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another method is more suitable for isotopes with long half-lives (and therefore slow rates of decay), Macdougall says. In this approach, scientists measure the amount of a particular isotope in a sample and then compare that with the amounts of various “daughter products” that form as the isotope decays. By taking the ratios of those amounts — or even the ratios of amounts of daughter products alone — and then “running the clock backward,” researchers can estimate when radioactive decay first began (that is, when the object formed).</p>



<p>Scientists still have to be careful. A radiometric clock can be “reset” if either the original isotope or its daughter products are lost to the environment. Robust crystals called zircons, for example, are long-lasting and present in many rocks. But extreme temperatures can drive lead, a daughter product of radioactive uranium and thorium, out of the crystal.</p>



<p>Despite the potential challenges, scientists have used radiometric dating to answer all sorts of questions. Researchers used lead-lead dating — which looks at two lead isotopes, both daughter products of a uranium isotope — to analyze an inclusion inside an ancient meteorite; in 2010, they reported that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-system-older-estimated">the tiny bleb was about 4.568 billion years old</a>, making it one of the earliest building blocks of our solar system. The team used an aluminum-magnesium dating technique to confirm that great age. Others have used similar techniques to estimate the age of Earth’s oldest known rocks (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/precious-little-gems">about 4.4 billion years</a>) and when plate tectonics might have begun (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plate-tectonics-got-early-start">more than 4 billion years ago</a>, according to one study).</p>

ERICKSON</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And even though some of these techniques are estimating ages billions of years in the past, “they can do so with error bars of only 100,000 years or so,” says Marc Caffee, a physicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. “I marvel at the precision these chronometers have,” he adds.</p>



<p>Dating techniques that rely on isotopes with half-lives measured in millions of years can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quick-bite-some-gorges-carved-surprisingly-fast">estimate long-term rates of erosion</a> — to help gauge how quickly a canyon was carved, for example — or to infer the onset of glacial activity during recent ice ages.</p>



<p>At least half a dozen radiometric dating techniques can be applied to the last few million years when humans and our kin evolved, says Potts. For example, by using argon-argon dating to pin down the age of tiny crystals in ancient layers of volcanic ash — crystals that had formed during the eruptions themselves — researchers have estimated that the <em>Australopithecus</em> dubbed Lucy lived about 3.18 million years ago. Today’s archaeologists and paleontologists also benefit from another half dozen or so absolute dating techniques beyond radiometric approaches, expanding the types of materials that can be dated, Potts says.</p>



<p>Advances in techniques over time have let researchers analyze increasingly smaller and smaller samples. That, in turn, is less destructive of rare — or even one-of-a-kind — artifacts or fossils. Whereas once researchers had to destroy large samples of material to perform an analysis, “now we can date a single kernel of maize,” says Ryan Williams, an anthropological archaeologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p>

<p>Other advances, which have made radiometric dating techniques cheaper and more precise, send researchers back to the lab to reanalyze artifacts, says Suzanne Pilaar Birch, an archaeologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. And more samples and more precision yield more refined chronologies. By radiocarbon dating nearly 100 samples from a mountaintop site in southern Peru, for instance, Williams and his colleagues determined that the site was occupied for more than four centuries.</p>



<p>The results of all this dating, Pilaar Birch notes, are “changing our understanding of the past.”</p>
